      "Transcript/Content": "12-year-old performs at 76ers game \nTaylor Swift of Wyomissing Hills was invited to sing the national anthem. \nBy Jeremy Carroll\n\nTaylor A. Swift, 12, of Wyomissing Hills, thought her 10-year-old brother, Austin K., might have been playing an April Fool's Day joke on her when he told her the Philadelphia 76ers invited her to sing the national anthem at an upcoming home basketball game.\nBut Austin was telling the truth, relaying the information from their father, Scott K., who phoned with the thrilling day-after-Easter news.\n\"My mom and I were just jumping up and down we were so excited,\" said Taylor, who sang the anthem just before tip-off of the Sixers game against the Detroit Pistons on April 5.\n\"I just really love doing that sort of thing,\" she said. \"It is an adrenaline rush for me.\"\nSwift, a sixth-grader at West Reading Elementary Center, sang the national anthem at a Reading Phillies game several years ago.\nLast month she did another rendition at a basketball game at Wyomissing High School in which the Harlem Wizards played against the Wyomissing Heroes, made up of school faculty and other members of the community.\nIt was her performance at the Wizards' game that gave her the chance to sing at a much larger venue, Philadelphia's First Union Center, where 20,754 fans came to see the Sixers and Pistons play.\nScott Swift sent in a video of his daughter singing the anthem to the 76ers, hoping the team would recognize her talent.\nSixers manager of game operations Kathy Drysdale, who said she gets hundreds of videotapes from perform ers interested in singing the anthem at one of the team's exhibition games or 41 regular season home games, sat up and took notice of Swift.\n\"She has this fantastic voice that catches everyone's attention,\" Drysdale said. \"Her voice is so strong and powerful at 12 years old. You look at her and think, 'Did that come out of her mouth?\"\nSwift left for Philadelphia right after school on April 5 with her parents, brother and a friend of her brother. They encountered lots of traffic and wound up making it to the arena just in time for her sound check at 5. Shortly after their arrival, team officials presented Taylor, Austin and Austin's friend with duffel bags full of 76ers merchandise, including basketballs, jerseys and hats. Taylor also received a jersey signed by some of the Sixers players.\nAfter getting ready in a private dressing room, Swift was escorted by a security guard onto the court, which was adorned with a red carpet.\nHer mother, Andrea F., admitted she was very nervous leading up to the anthem.\n\"They had a number of cameras all focused right around her and she was up on the big screen,\" Andrea said. \"It's very, very scary as a mom to see your child out there.\"\nTaylor was much more relaxed about the whole thing, experiencing few butterflies even as the lights were dimmed just moments before her performance.\n\"I was just practicing the first note over and over in my head,\" she said. Swift, who sang the final words of the anthem in the midst of deafening cheers from the crowd, said the whole experience was a big thrill. \"All of these NBA players and all of these other people were looking at me,\" she said. \"It was really a wonderful feeling.\"\nSwift has been performing practically all of her life in local theater productions.\nNext Friday and Saturday she will perform in Wyomissing High School's production of \"The Sound of Music.\" Swift, whose maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, Wyomissing Park, is a retired opera singer, has been pursuing a country music singing career. The aspiring singing star, who also plays electric guitar, performed with the Pat Garrett Band at last year's Bloomsburg Fair and has cut a country CD.\nLate last month the Swifts traveled to Nashville, where they distributed the CD to record companies in the hope of landing a recording deal. When she is not busy performing. Swift enjoys spending time with her friends.",

She performed the national anthem at a Reading Phillies game and for the Philadelphia 76ers, where more than 20,000 people gave her a standing ovation.\nA resident of Wyomissing Hills, PA., and Stone Harbor, Swift has been singing since she was very young.\nThis summer, she has been performing most Saturday evenings at Henny's in Stone Harbor.\n\"Taylor has been singing constantly since she could talk,\" Andrea Swift said. \"We would take her to a movie like the 'Little Mermaid,' and she would memorize the songs right away and sing them on the way home.\"\nTaylor began her \"career\" in a school play in second grade.\n\"I knew I wanted to act and sing when I was in that play,\" she said. \"Right after that, I saw an ad for a children's theater company and I auditioned. I got in the company, and in my second play I got a lead role. I love singing more than acting but I like to act because I think it helps with stage presence.\"\nTaylor has performed in \"Annie\" and \"The Sound of Music\" and had the leads in \"Grease\" and \"West Side Story.\" She says she is rarely nervous before a performance.\n\"When I see all those people, it's such a rush,\" she said. \"Once I get up there and start singing, I'm fine. I love it.\"\nShe also enjoys writing and won a national poetry contest last year. She was chosen one of the top ten young poetry writers in Pennsylvania and had her works included in an anthology.

She also plays volleyball, writes songs and plays the guitar.\nShe will be opening for the Charlie Daniels Band this September in Strausstown, Pa.\n\"Taylor does her own one-hour country music shows and will get up on stage at a moment's notice,\" Andrea Swift said. \"She really is amazing. When it comes to singing the national anthem, the first note to her is critical. It is one of the hardest songs to perform. If you start out with too low a note, you can't do the end of the song. If you start out too high it's the same thing. But Taylor always performs it perfectly.\"\nTaylor is so dedicated to her craft that she even sold a horse she had because riding was interfering with her rehearsals.\nA straight-A student, she remains level-headed about her goals.\n\"I want to get signed with a record company and take it from there,\" she said. \"I would love to do this as a career. But if I can't, I want to do interior design or write children's books.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "[WIP Formatting] In this final installment of our “Kids Who Play” series, we introduce a savvy 14-year old from Pennsylvania who’s making the kind of waves in Nashville that LeAnn Rimes and Tanya Tucker did at a similarly tender age, and a 15-year-old Southern California guitarist who’s already discovering the joys of DIY.\n\nTaylor Swift lovingly refers to her koa Taylor 12-string as her “baby.” She also owns a Custom 612ce. Obviously, these two high-end guitars represent a serious investment in gear for a 14-yearold. But then, Swift, and those around her, have every reason to take her musical talent seriously.  Recently, Taylor’s family relocated to Nashville to concentrate on her blossoming career; she is signed to a “development” deal with RCA Records, and is managed by Dan Dymtrow, Britney Spears’ manager. By the time you read this, you might already have seen Swift posing with her cherished K65ce in the August issue of Vanity Fair magazine; Dymtrow arranged for her to be one of 27 young, up-and-coming celebrity models photographed by Bruce Weber for the new \"Rising Stars\" Abercrombie and Fitch ad campaign. Her image will also appear in Abercrombie's new catalog. Swift was born in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, and grew up listening to Patsy Cline, LeAnn Rimes, and Dolly Parton. At age eight, she joined a children’s theater group and subsequently got the lead role of Sandy in Grease. Her country-influenced rendition of “Hopelessly Devoted to You” caused a stir, and she never looked back.  Taylor went on to sing at fairs and festivals, and by age 12 she was the opening act on a bill that included Diamond Rio, Trace Adkins, Tammy Cochran, and Darryl Worley. Since then, she has opened for the Charlie Daniels Band, and has sung the National Anthem at numerous sporting events, including Philadelphia 76ers basketball games and the 2003 U.S. Open. The latter engagement led to her most important career connection to date.  “While I was singing the National Anthem, the entertainment director for the U.S. Open started asking my dad about me,” she says. “Afterward, my dad put together this typical ‘dad video’ type of thing — with the cat chewing the neck of my Taylor, and stuff like that — and sent it to her, not knowing that she was going to send it to Dan Dymtrow.  “Dan called and asked us to come down and play for him in his office, so I brought my first 12-string down and played some songs for them. Dan said, ‘I want to work with you guys,’ and it’s been great ever since! I love Dan — he is an awesome manager.” Swift had tried to learn guitar at age eight, but the timing and the approach didn’t work.  “I was being taught by the note, every note on the scale, and I just wasn’t interested in that. I wasn’t even sure if I wanted to be a singer at that point, you know? I mean, you’re eight years old!” she says, laughing. A few years later, she again tried taking lessons, and this time the teenage Swift found the experience much different.  “By the second week, I’d learned three chords and I’d written my first song,” she recalls. “Now I’m working on fingerpicking and music theory.”  Although Swift’s parents don’t play any instruments, her maternal grandmother was an opera singer, so there’s a hereditary precedent for Taylor’s vocal ability.  “My grandparents lived all over the world. In Puerto Rico, my grandmother was the hostess of the top-rated TV variety show, called The Pan-American Show. Nanny’s Spanish was so bad that the Puerto Ricans thought she was hysterically funny! She went on to become the ‘Madrina’ [symbolic grandmother figure] of their Air Force; they really loved her. She starred in a lot of operas and was a member of the Houston Grand Opera. I think that’s where I got most of my musical ability.”  Swift’s nascent songwriting skills also seem to have genetic roots. She sees a natural link between her lyric-writing and the fact that people in her family write poems.  “Songwriting talent is something you’re born with,” she says. “You have to nurture it, and you have to work with it, and you definitely have a say in which direction you go with it, but I think you’re born with any kind of writing ability, which no one can ever take away from you. And I don’t think you can teach someone to write if they don’t have a sense of how to do it.” \n\nLately, Taylor has been putting her budding talent to the test by co-writing songs with veteran tunesmiths in Nashville. She’s already done some co-writes with last year’s BMI Songwriter of the Year, Troy Verges, whose credits include “Blessed” (for Martina McBride), “I Would’ve Loved You Anyway” (Trisha Yearwood), “Sleep Tonight” (Tim McGraw), “Windows on a Train” (Jessica Andrews), and “Naked” (Celine Dion). She’s also written with Brett James, who wrote “Love is a Sweet Thing” for Faith Hill and “Tryin’” for Pam Tillis.  “I can’t wait to write with a lot more people,” Swift says. “I definitely think I have my own style, and I’d like to stay true to that, but on the other hand, you never\nstop learning. I’m never going to say I’m the ‘best’ at anything, because that’s just\nstupid. You’re always going to keep learning, and at no point will I know everything. I figure, if you surround yourself\nwith people who are better than you, it can\nonly bring you up.”\n If some aspects of Swift’s creativity\nwere inherited, the decision to play guitar\nseems all her own.  “I just thought the guitar looked really\ncool!” she says. “It also had to do with the\ntypes of music I liked — country and\nrock. I had tried to play piano, and I think you’re either a piano person, where you\nhave finger coordination and you can go\nall over the keyboard, or a guitar person,\nwhere you’re using the muscles of your\nfingers to push down strings and play chords. Both are very hard to learn, and\nsome people can do both, but I can’t!”\n Swift says she’s been desperately trying\nto learn to play some songs on piano, but\nshe keeps coming back to guitar.\n “I guess guitar is really what I was meant to play, because it seems to be what\nI have a knack for. I actually learned on a 12-string,\nso when I picked up my first 6-string, I was, like, whoa, this is easy! I think when I got over the first\nlittle bumps of learning to\nplay guitar, it really paid off, because from then on it was easy. When I started learning to fingerpick and stuff like that, I\nstarted to play my 612ce more. But the 12-\nstring will always be my favorite, ’cause it’s\nthe first guitar I played.”\nSwift admits that she might want to try the electric guitar someday, but only\nafter she’s become more adept at playing\nsolos and classical music on acoustic guitar. There’s also something organic about\nan acoustic that she finds hard to resist.\n “I can’t get over the sound that acoustic guitars put out — I just love it. And nothing comes between me and my Taylor12-\nstring! It makes a definite impression\nwhen I pull that beautiful koa guitar out of\nthe case. And, of course, the [Taylor] name correlation works well, too!”\n Things are clicking for Swift. Her song,\n“The Outside”, has been slated for the\nChicks with Attitude CD being sponsored\nby Maybelline New York, which is part of the “Chicks with Attitude” tour featuring\nLiz Phair, Katy Rose, the Cardigans, and others. The CD is scheduled to come out in August. Swift’s immediate goals are at\nonce modest and ambitious.  “I hope to be one of the ‘others’!”\n(www.taylorswift.com)",

      "Transcript/Content": "Moving Swiftly Toward Stardom \nWhile most of her peers are dreaming themselves into the pictures of music stars taped to their walls, Taylor Swift is living the dream.\n\nThe Wyomissing teenager recently moved to Nashville, Tenn., to pursue a career in country music inspired by LeAnn Rimes and nurtured by performances in local theater.\n“We really made the commitment to move here and see what happens,” said Swift, 14. “Before it was like two weeks out of every month we’d come down here to go to meetings.”\nNow she goes to meetings after she gets out of school (she just finished eighth grade) and still has plenty of time to travel around the country to perform.\nSwift recently performed at The Bitter End in New York City, and has sung the National Anthem at the U.S. Tennis Championships. She has also performed during half-time at a Knicks game in Madison Square Garden.\n“It’s really just been awesome,” she said, adding that she really never even picked up a guitar until she was 12.\n“But I always liked to sing,” she said. “I started with children’s theater in Reading and that’s when people noticed that I had some country in my voice.”\nIt was the guitar though, that led her to a new passion: songwriting. “I picked up the guitar, and I learned three chords and then I was writing songs,” she said. “Being able to create music is just awesome. I love it.”\nSo far Swift has penned 84 songs (although by the time this story publishes that number will likely be higher) and is looking for a music publisher to represent her. She already has a manager, Dan Dymtrow, who also managed Britney Spear’s career, and a record deal with RCA.\n“It’s important to pick the right publisher so we’re taking our time with it,” Swift said. “That’s what we’re going to be doing this summer.”\nThis summer she’ll also be working with other songwriters in Nashville.\n“I want to do some co-writing of songs, too,” she said. “It really helps to have someone else’s opinion and it gets you more creative.”\nThe age of her co-writers doesn’t matter at all to her. “They can be in their 20s or 30s or 50s,” she said. “There are so many great writers here. There are 15,000 writers alone in Nashville and it’s just a great opportunity to work with them.”\nSwift will also likely be getting fan mail from readers of the Abercrombie & Fitch catalog, in which she is featured. It was released Thursday.\nThe A&F catalog – which has sparked controversy over some of the arguably risque photos used – will feature 20 up-and-coming stars in the July 1 issue.\nTaylor Swift, with her long blond hair, thoughtfully wise eyes and peaches-and-cream complexion, is one of them.\n“Don’t worry,” she said. “I won’t be getting naked or anything. It’s not raunchy at all this time.”\nIn addition to several photos of her wearing jeans and shirts from A&F, there’s also some biographical material about her included in the catalog. Swift said she’s included with other young people, but said she believes she’s the only musician.\n“I think everyone else was an actor,” she said. “I know that the guy who is Luke (Chris Carmack) on “The OC” is in it.”\nSwift will also likely get fan mail when the CD “Chicks With Attitude” is released in August. The CD is in conjunction with the Maybelline-sponsored tour this summer featuring Liz Phair, Katy Rose, and The Cardigans.\nSwift’s song “The Outsider” is on the CD. She said that song, as well as most of her songs, spring from her love of poetry.\n“I’ve always written poetry,” she said. ” ‘The Outsider’ is about how it feels to be outside looking in. That’s how I felt sometimes, and it’s the way anyone would feel when they are going through a tough time.”\nRemember, Swift is all of 14. “I’ve always been this way,” she said of her ability to translate her feelings into words (and now music.)\n“I write about love and break-ups,” she said. “I like to write story songs. For me, well, I think it’s something that I was born with. I don’t think you can teach someone to do it, and you also can’t take it away.”\nShe also likes to listen to songs, too. Right now her two favorite artists are LeAnn Rimes and Martina McBride. She hasn’t met either of them yet, but she’s hoping to.\n“There are people who are hoping to get us together soon,” she said. “But I haven’t met them yet.”\nSwift said that the move to Tennessee was definitely the right thing to do, even though it means her father, Scott, has to commute between Pennsylvania where he works for Merrill Lynch and Nashville where he is one of his daughter’s biggest cheerleaders.\n“This is just so exciting for her and for us,” Scott Swift said. “It’s all starting to really happen for her.”\nThe younger Swift said she’s not in any great hurry, and wants her career to be long-lasting, not a flash in the pan.\n“Pop music is different from country,” she said. It can take up to two years to get an album on the airwaves in country music, she said. Pop stars can crank out an album in weeks or months.\nRight now, Swift is thrilled with the way her career is going, but there is one drawback.\n“I do miss my friends,” Swift said of those she left behind in Wyomissing. “But I can’t imagine not being here and not doing this. I feel it was meant to be.”\nContact Tracy Rasmussen: entertainment@readingeagle.com.",

      "Transcript/Content": "When Taylor Swift, 14, lived in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, she wanted to do two things — fit in with her friends and pursue a career as a country music singer and songwriter.\n\nIt wasn't a good fit. Her friends didn't like country music and didn't understand her desire to sing professionally.\n\n\"Back home in Pennsylvania, it was so hard to keep friends. I always had two lives ... They didn't like that I had this career thing,\" said Swift, a summer resident here since birth. Some people lash out when frustration sets in. But Swift is better at expressing herself through music — she has already written more than 100 songs. So, on one rainy weekend evening in January when none of her friends had called, she picked up her guitar and began to write. Thirty minutes later, with the chord progressions memorized, she was done and ready to write the lyrics on her computer to a tune she titled \"The Outsider.\" \"I wrote exactly what I was feeling,\" Swift said.\n\nThe song Swift created at that moment turned out so well that it made it onto the Maybelline \"Chicks With Attitude\" CD, which coincides with the \"Chicks With Attitude 2004 Concert Tour\" featuring Liz Phair, The Cardigans, Katy Rose and Charlotte Martin. The CD is given away free with the purchase of Maybelline products at Rite Aid and other stores.\n\nIn April, Swift and her family moved from Pennsylvania to a town outside of Nashville to make it easier for her to pursue her country music career. Along the way, Swift also acquired an \"overall manager,\" Dan Dymtrow, who also serves as Britney Spears' management representative. \"She blew me away with her talent, creativity, songwriting and personality,\" Dymtrow said in an e-mail interview.\n\nDymtrow recommended \"The Outsider\" to Maybelline officials for the compilation CD. Once accepted, the song - which started with just Swift's voice and guitar accompaniment - was recorded with a full band and turned into a contemporary country track in Nashville. When Dymtrow called to tell Swift that her song made it onto the CD, she was eating at a Taco Bell.\n\n\"I was ecstatic! I started screaming. Everybody looked at me like I was crazy,\" Swift said.\n\nSwift's perseverance despite the negative input from her friends has paid off. The precocious teen known mostly in Pennsylvania and in southern New Jersey for singing at Henny's here two years ago when she was only 12, is now attracting national attention. Recently, the clothing company Abercrombie & Fitch selected her for its rising stars campaign. A black and white picture of her holding her guitar is in the current Vanity Fair magazine (the August issue with the Reagans on the cover). The same picture is in the Abercrombie & Fitch catalog/magazine available at Abercrombie stores nationwide and in the \"lifestyle/music\" section of the company's Web site at abercrombie.com\n\nSwift also landed a development deal with RCA Nashville in September. She has recorded two songs for a four-song demo package that she will use to seek a record deal with RCA. This fall, she will perform a showcase in front of the record company's executives. None of this is too soon for Swift, who is happiest being busy.\n\n\"I don't want to be an adult country singer. I want to get out there as soon as possible,\" she said. \"A young pop singer is 14 years old. A young country singer is 29 years old.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Local rising star graces Abercrombie mural.\nWalk into an Abercrombie and Fitch store in the RiverGate Mall and you'll see a mural of Taylor Swift, a freshman at Hendersonville High School.\nSwift is one of Nashville's aspirantsinger-songwriters. During spring break last April, she packed her bags and moved with her family from Pennsylvania to the Nashville area. Abercrombie and Fitch's fall advertising campaign, \"Rising Stars,\" features photographs ofup-and-coming singers, actors and actresses like Amy Redford, Robert Redford's daughter. When Swift's manager learned about the \"Rising Stars\" campaign, he sent the company a press kit, \"and they immediately called him back and were like - yeah, we want her on the shoot,\" Swift said. \"I was just thinking, I am not cool enough to for this! I mean, it's Abercrombie and Fitch... I was so excited, I was just freaking out.\"\nIn April, just befor she moved to Nashville, Swift went to the eight-hour photoshoot at a ranch about 45 minutes from Los Angeles surrounded by mountains and fields. Swift said some of Shania Twain's videos have been filmed at the same location. Now, Swift's photograph appears in Abercrombie and Fitch's fall magazine and hangs as a mural on store walls across the country.\nSwift was born in Wyomissing, a little town in Pennsylvania, and began singing with a children's theater at age eight, She began singing to larger audiences - at a Philadelphia 76ers game, for example - and then sang the national anthem at the 2003 U.S. Open. \"The person who had booked the entertainment for that struck a relationship with my dad,\" Swift said. \"We started sending her tapes, and she passed these tapes to a New York manager named Dan Dymtrow. And Dan Dymtrow is the management representative for Britney Spears. He gave us a call and asked me to come and do a concert for him in New York.\" Swift said she sang about 12 songs, \"and we decided to work together, and it's been really great.\"\nSwift plays a six-string guitar, for fingerpicking and for softer songs, and also a 12-string guitar, which she usually plays at live shows -- it makes her sound more like she's playing with a band, she said.\nShe has signed a development deal with RCA Records and is diligently working to make it as a musician, writing songs and practising several hours a day, building a collection she hopes to make into a CD. She has written 102 songs and is now co-writing with other Nashville songwriters.\nCosmetics company Maybelline New York is distributing a CD in retail stores for its \"Chicks With Attitude\" makeup line, on which one of Swift's songs is included; and Swift is interviewed in the summer edition of Taylor Guitar's magazine Wood&Steel. Swift will perform in Nashville next in November at the Blue Bird Café.",

Swift was in first grade.\n\n\"I was just dead set, that's what I'm going to be, I'm going to be like her,\" Swift said. \"I'm always going to be so close to my family; I'm always going to love my friends; but number one is always going to be music, because it's just kind of always been a part of me.

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] On the way to stardom: HHS student moves to town to advance her music career \nBy Tena Lee Staff Writer | Staff photo by Tena Lee\n\nAs a six-year-old growing up in the small Pennsylvania town, of Wyomissing, Taylor Swift often mimicked the moves of her teen idol, LeAnn Rimes. \nAs she grew, Swift's fascina-tion with country music also blossomed, inspiring her to write a slew of songs, take pro-fessional voice lessons and learn to play the guitar. And now, at the tender age of 15, her passion has brought her to Hendersonville and some believe the verge of stardom. Swift, who moved to Hendersonville with her family last April to pursue a career in the country music industry, comes with an already-impressive resume and at least one big name behind her. \nHer list of accomplishments includes singing the National Anthem at the U.S. Open in 2003, performing at the Blue Bird Cafe, and being featured in a national advertising campaign for Abercrombie & Fitch. She was also featured recently on Good Morning America, and had a song she penned included on a CD compilatiort for Maybelline. \nSwift will perform this weekend at the opening ceremony of the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio, Texas. Perhaps one of the biggest indications of just how high her star could rise is who her manager is. The name may not ring a bell, but the name of his one other client surely will: Britney Spears. But before you think mega-manager Dan Dymtrow plans to \"do it again\" with Swift, think again. Although she considers the pop music diva a friend and respects her talent, the Hender-sonville High School freshman is clearly focused on becoming a country music singer/songwriter. \n\"When you write a song and sing it, it's so much more personal. It's really a personal connection added to the song when you write it,\" said Swift. Think Jewel with a twang. \nIn her tussled braids, low-riding jeans and razor thin physique, she looks taylor-made for Aber crombie & Fitch, but does she have what it takes to be a soulful songwriter? \nSony Music Publishing's Senior Director of Creative Ser vices and Production, who recently signed Swift, seems to think so. \n\"She is a fine, fine songwriter and a good guitar player,\" said Arthur Buenahora who admitted that he has never signed someone as young as his latest client. \n\"If anyone can be that good that early, it's scary how good she will be,\" said Buenahora who also signed curly-locked country music newcomer Dierks Bentley. \"Someone like Taylor Swift doesn't walk in your office ever, and when they do, you better do your best to work with them.\" Buenahora added. \"She's a star.\" \nSwift, who has penned over 100 songs already, admits that at 15, she writes about what's on the minds of most 15-year-old girls 15-year-old boys. \"There's so many things about love that inspire me,\" she said. \"If a guy's going to be mean to me, there's definitely going to be a song about it.\" \nBesides setting her sights on stardom Swift admits she's not unlike most girls her age. With some of her buddies clutching newly acquired driver's licenses, the youngster enjoys \"just riding around with her friends often just to Wal-Mart and back \nOnce considered \"uncool in Wyomissing for her love of country music, Swift said she feels right at home here in Hendersonville. \n\"It's a small town without the small-town attitude,\" she added. \"I've just been accepted here. It's really nice.\" \nHer mom Andrea and dad Scott, who recently took top honors in the Jr. Chamber's lighted boat parade this past December, agree that the move has been good for the whole family which also includes Swift's 12-year-old brother Austin and her cat Indy. \nBesides physically being where she needs to be to make her dreams come true, Swift is excited about writing alongside some of the best songwriters in the industry at Sony Publishing. \n\"I just feel so lucky that I've found what I love to do so early,\" she said. \"And I'm going to run with it if I can.\" \n\nPHOTO 1 CAPTION: With the help of her cat Indy, recent Hendersonville resident Taylor Swift practices  for a performance at the U.

      "Transcript/Content": "Soundwaves Ascending country music star Taylor Swift first made waves growing up on her family's Sea Rays\nby Randy Hess; photos by Steven J. Conway\n\nMany people think of waves as moving objects, ridges of water traveling across a sea or lake. But waves are not a flow of water; they are a flow of energy through water. The impact isn't felt by the medium, but rather by whatever that energy crashes against. Sound waves adhere to a similar model, and while the air may reverberate with the energy of music, it is in our ears, our feet and our hearts where a song really packs its wallop. So maybe it's simple physics that explains now Nashville's Swift clan has taken so much energy from boating and music.\n\"We've grown up on Sea Rays,\" says 16-year-old Taylor Swift of her and her 13-year-old brother, Austin. \"At the age of four, I lived in a lifejacket. We've always been able to establish and maintain a family atmosphere even when we're far from home, and I think all those years going to the shore helped that.\n\nThe Swifts loved trips from their Pennsylvania home to Stone Harbor, New Jersey, where they'd max out time on thefa mily's 210 Sundeck. It was all about amping up the family vibe and softening the impact of dad Scott's hectic career as a financial advisor for Merrill Lynch. Years later they've relocated to Tennessee's Old Hickory Lake, and the Swifts still lean on boating to recharge the family batteries. Only now, Taylor has two-stepped onto the country music escalator, and their 420 Sundancer and 220 Sundeck, bought from Chris Cooke at Erwin Marine Sales of Nashville, allow a respite from her go-go schedule, as well. \n\n\"It's a lot of work helping Tay pursue a music career, but it's a lot of fun, too,\" says mom Andrea in the cockpit of their Sundancer Bling, as Taylor works out a chord progression on her Taylor brand guitar lounging on the rear bench. Austin flips through screens on the chartplotter, and Scott steers the boat toward Johnny Cash's house up the lake a couple of miles. \"If she were pursuing soccer with this much commitment, we'd be behind her the same way,\" Scott says. Of course, she would have to be a pretty good soccer player for the family to pack up and move for her career.\n\n\"Music has always been my game,\" Taylor explains. \"It's my after-school activity. Everyone at school knows it's what I do and the're all really supportive.\"\n\nThe Swifts moved to Hendersonville, a Nashville suburb, when Taylor was 14, about the time she signed an artist development deal with RCA. \"Andrea and Taylor had been road-tripping to Nashville a lot for songwriting and recording sessions, and we realized it might make sense to move,\" Scott says. When Andrea found a place on Old Hickory Lake, we stopped at the dock on the way up to check out the house. I looked down the cove toward the lake, imagined my Sea Ray tied up there and said, 'I'll take it.' She said 'Don't you want to see the house first'\"\n\nThe Sundancer cruises past a scrubby, mostly submerged island with a rusty steeldrum barbecue standing knee-deep in the water. Austin says it's called 'Two Foot, a great place to hang out on the weekends with the barbecue cranking, a volleyball net in the water and teenegers doing the nautical version of that slow drive up and down Main Street. Austin and Taylor clearly have the closeness so common to siblings who grew up on boats together. Austin gladly made the move to support Taylor's dream and has really taken to their new home, playing football at school and building a great clique of friends with whom he can now easily hang on water. In fact, all four of the Swifts are really happy with the move, well above and beyond what has meant for Taylor's blossoming career. \n\nAnd to think it all started with \"Grease\". Playing love-struck Sandy in a children's theatre production, a 10-year-old Taylor emoted her way through 'Hopelessly Devoted To You' causing another parent to lean in and compliment, 'you have a great country singer there.\" Scott and Andrea weren't too surprised because Taylor had avays taken after Andrea's bon vivant mother. \"Nanny was always such an influence on me,\" Taylor says wistfully of her late grandmother. \"She sang opera, she had a TV show, lived and performed overseas and was always dressed to impress. She contributed so much to who I am.\"\n\nTaylor began singing with backing tracks at fairs and festivals and it just started to snowball: opening for acts like the Charlie Daniels Band, singing the national anthem before NBA games and the U.S. Tennis Open, and giving mini concerts halftimes and special events. Along the way, she learned to play the guitar. When she won a national poetry contest, Taylor realised that she wanted to write songs. One of her first was called \"Kid in the Crowd and was inspired by seeing one of her idols, LeAnn Rimes, another country singer who had an early start The idea of the song was that for every performer on the stage, there's a kid in the crowd who wants to make it big someday. \n\n\"Songwriting has been my favorite part of this whole thing, and I think its what I'm best at,\" Taylor says. Apparently a lot of Music Row pros agree. There is a clear undercurrent of strength in many of her songs, with confident narrators who refuse to be victims or with empowering messages to buck up friends in need. Maybe it's the default mind of a generation of girls forwhom the Title IX has always been the norm. In any case, listening to her songs is very affirming. \"All of my songs have a unique little story behind them. It's fun to document your life that way. Each one reminds me of something specific. It's like having a big quirky photo album.\n\nScott comes off plane to idle past the late Roy Orbinson's spectacular home. Next door is the Cash family, 18-room rambling house, put on sale for $2.8 million in the months after Johnny and June Carter Cash died in 2003. Taylor can't believe nobody has snatched it up and whips out her cell phone to take down the Realtor's number off the sign. She has no illusions of buying it, but wants to try to get a showing just to check out where Johnny wrote and recarded so many classics. Seeing his daughter wide-eyed interest Scott winces at the price. 'It's worth twice that for the icon value,\" Taylor argues. 'He was The Man in Black!\" They didn't know it then, but the dispute would ultimately be settled by a Bee Gee. Several months later, Barry Gibb, woud purchase the house after the price was reduced to $2.5 million, saying he hoped for musical inspiration.\n\nAfter returning Bling to the dock, the Swifts pile into a car to head downtown to the Country Music Hall of Fame. Even after reality slipped his grasp. Elvis never could have dreamed of the number of famous guitars, Caddillacs and Gold Records that are stuffed into this museum. This, of course, suggests it as the perfect spot for Taylor to sign her actual record deal with Big Machine Records. At the entrance, the Swifts catch up with Scott Borchetta, the label's president. Scott is soft-spoken and stylish, but he's also a demon of a pro circle track racer on the side, having taken the NASCAR Weekly Racing Series championship in the Super Truck division three seasons in a row now. As a music executive, he's equally relentless, and has guided the careers of some of country's biggest stars, including Toby Keith, George Strait, Reba McEntire, Vince Wynonna, Trisha Yearwood, Shania Twain, Sugarland, Conway Twitty and Lee Ann Womack. \"There are so many people in this town excited about Taylor and eager for her now album to come out,\" he says.\n\nScott Borchetta and Taylor cleary have a warm relationship and, as the contracts are being sorted out for signing, she bubbles to him about the latest song she's written. He asks to hear it, she grabs her guitar and plays 'Tied Together with a Smile' for him as he closes his eyes and listens deep, imagining the hook fleshed out by a band and thinking about where it might fit on Taylor's debut. The first single, perhaps? Looking at the stack of contracts, Taylor says, \"It's kind of like a wedding contract.\" Scott smiles and answers, \"No, it's more binding.\" They sign, pictures are taken, handshakes, kisses, and it's off to the Palm Restaurant for a celebratory dinner before the hard work begins in earnest.\n\nWith the energy set in motion, it's a waiting game to see how this wave impacts ears, feet and hearts. As with thei Sea Rays before, Taylor's music career has already added so much to the Swift family's lives. Now it's eager to see how far the wave will roll. Later this summer we'll all be able to dip our own feet in the surf.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Life in the Swift Lane\nEditor's note: You've probably seen GAC'S new series, Shortcuts, featuring rising star Taylor Swift. Now GACTV.com takes you way behind the scenes, even before Taylor filmed Shortcuts! Writer Jamison Rotch spent a day with Taylor last fall as her big adventure was just beginning. Read on for a detailed day-in-the-life of one af country's most promising young talents.\n\nTaylor Swift is nervous.\nIt's hard to blame her. In a little less than four hours the 15-year-old sophomore will take the stage at a press conference in downtown Nashville announcing her as one of the first artists signed to a new record label started by veteran label executive Scott Borchetta. But it isn't the glare of the national media spotlight that has the butterflies fluttering in her stomach.\n\nIt's the car ride over.\n\n\"I can drive in a straight line and tum,\" admits Taylor, who is scheduled to get her license in a few months. \"But I don't like arrows and lines. And I don't like stop signs. The whole bigger car rule definitely applies when I drive.\"\nSuch is life these days for Taylor Swift a balancing act of the ordinary trials and tribulations of a teenager with the extraordinary existence of an artist on the brink of stardom.\nI've spent the morning before the press conference following Taylor around her high school in Hendersonville, Tenn., a small town that has not quite been absorbed into the sprawl of Music City. It is very much the typical start of a day of a typical teenager. First period was Latin II. After the bell, it was a mad dash back to Taylor's locker for a change of notebooks and a quick gossip session with friends before we're off again, this time to a second period Fashion class.\nHalfway through a lecture on the cyclical nature of style is the first hint this will not be just another day. The intercom crackles to life and the pleasant voice of the secretary informs Taylor her mother has arrived to check her out of school. Several students and her teacher offer their well-wishes as she gathers her books. Minutes later I am hurtling south on 1-65 towards downtown.\nIt seems fitting that Taylor's first idol in country music was LeAnn Rimes. \"I knew every song she ever sang,\" she says. LeAnn at the time was 14 years old, just starting her career. Taylor was six, just starting elementary school. \"After that, I kind of went back and learned the history of (country music),\" she says. \"I listened to legends like Dolly and Patsy Cline--women who were the essence of country music.\"\nA love of music soon developed into a need to perform and it was not long before she joined the children's theatre group in her hometown of Wyomissing. Pennsylvania. It was onstage she noticed something interesting about her singing style. \"I was playing the role of Sandy in Grease and it just came out sounding country. It was all I had listened to so I guess it was just kind of natural. I decided country music was what I needed to be doing.\"\nTaylor spent the next few years honing her talent anywhere she could-dragging her parents with her to national anthems at ballgames, performing at countless karaoke contests and even the occasional bar. Taylor smiles at the memory. \"They were kind of embarrassed by it, I guess. This little girl singing in this smoky bar. But they knew how much it meant to me so they went along with it.\"\nAt age 11, Taylor decided it was time to take her first trip to Nashville. She can laugh now at her naïve expectations. \"I was like, if I want to sing music, I'm going to need a record deal. So, I'm going to get a record deal. I thought it was that easy. I made a demo tape of me singing along to karaoke songs and my mom and I started walking up and down Music Row handing them out to receptionists at every label. I think I had like one person call me back. And he was so sweet, just kind of telling me, \"You know, this is not how you do this.\"\nTaylor returned to Pennsylvania without a record deal but a little wiser and even more focused on her music. For the first time, she picked up a guitar. Within ten minutes she had written her first song, \"Lucky You.\" She has not stopped writing since.\n\"Whatever you're feeling that day, it comes out of you,\" Taylor says of songwriting. \"It's kind of like photography-looking at a little picture album of where you are emotionally. I now consider myself a songwriter first and foremost, and I have never written anything I didn't mean.\"\nAs is the case with a struggling artist of any age, all Taylor needed was a break. It came at the U.S. Open tennis tournament, when her rendition of the national anthem wowed a crowd that included the manager of Britney Spears. Knowing young talent when he sees it, Taylor was quickly brought aboard his team. Within a few months, she was featured as a rising star in an Abercrombie & Fitch campaign.\nWhen Taylor made her return to Nashville, she came armed with a demo of songs she had written and plenty of buzz. This time Music City took notice. After a brief venture with RCA, Taylor eventually signed with Sony ATV publishing and began working with some of the biggest songwriters in town. She was 14 years old.\nWhen I ask if her age is ever an issue when working with other writers, Taylor pauses for a moment. It takes a moment to realize the teenager is trying to be diplomatic. \"Basically there are two kinds of people- people who see me as an artist and judge me by my music,\" she states. \"The other people judge me by a number-my age--which means nothing. Some people refuse to look past the fact that I am young.\"\nWhile writing at Sony, Taylor became a blip on the red-hot radar of Scott Borchetta, a man instrumental in the development of countless country stars over his 20-year career, including Toby Keith's rise to superstardom. As Borchetta was coming to the end of his tour of duty as senior VP of promotion and artist development at DreamWorks, he invited Taylor to drop by his office to play some of her songs. He was impressed enough to show up at a showcase for the young artist a few weeks later at the famed Bluebird Café. As Taylor remembers, \"Out of all the people in the room, he was the only one who had his eyes closed and was totally into the music.\"\n\"I was blown away,\" confesses Borchetta. \"She has this amazing filter. Everyday life comes in and it comes out Taylor Swift music.\"\nLittle did Taylor know that Borchetta was already making plans to venture out on his own. After hearing the talented young artist, he made signing Taylor one of his top priorities.\nIn Taylor, Borchetta sees the total package. \"She is so intelligent,\" he says, \"she's such a great writer, she has a great attitude. She's a hard worker.\" And although she displays all the qualities of a seasoned pro in the business, he admits there are occasional moments where Taylor's youth bubbles to the surface.\n\"She's teenager, which is so amazing because I get all those teenager phone calls,\" says Borchetta. \"She's just so cute, it's ridiculous. Her [outgoing] phone message is like, 'Hey, it's Taylor. I can't get your call right now but call back like 100 times and I'll get back to you.\"\nA short time after the Bluebird show, Taylor received a mysterious phone call from Borchetta. \"He was like, 'I'm going to be doing something and I need to talk to you in person because I don't trust the phone,\" she recalls. \"And I was like, if you don't trust the phone there has got to be something going on that I want to know about. And when I heard what he wanted to do. it absolutely blew my mind.\"\nWhat Borchetta wanted to do was take on the major Music Row record companies by starting up his own independent label, Big Machine Records. That is just the way Taylor likes it. \"That's always been my kind of thing,\" she says. \"I've wanted to stir it up. I've always wanted people to say, 'Okay, she's doing things a little differently.\"\nWhich brings us to this moment: hurtling down a major interstate to a national news conference and a recording contract awaiting her signature. As she narrowly avoids a merging 18-wheeler, Taylor mentions she had to take the written permit test three times before finally passing. \"I cried every time I failed, I was so sad,\" she gushes. \"But then when I passed, I cried because I was so happy.\"\nShe sounds like a schoolgirl, I think to myself, as I make sure my seatbelt is secure. And at this moment, it's hard not to wonder and worry about her, knowing what this business can do to the young. Then she gets a far off look in her eye and says matter-of-factly, \"You know, I'm not really looking to model my career after anyone. I'm looking to do something new. I want to do everything new. I mean country music will always be country music...but the audiences can be changed and expanded. I think it would be great if when I'm 90 years old and looking back on life, I can say I did things people didn't expect and was successful.\"\nSuddenly she seems anything but 15.\nI glance ahead at the road and find, amazingly enough for Nashville on a weekday afternoon, that traffic has cleared. The stretch of interstate ahead of us is now as wide-open as the future of this young woman behind the wheel. I look to Taylor Swift. From the gleam in her eyes, she has also noticed the empty asphalt in front of her. She smiles ever so slightly, tightens her grip on the steering wheel and steps on the gas.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Swift Rise\nMeet Taylor Swift, the 16-year-old daughter of Sea Ray owners Scott and Andrea Swift, and a freshly signed country music artist on Big Machine records. Sure she's got the stage presence, songwriting and singing talents to blow you away, but we're certain being a Sea Ray kid has to have contributed to her success.\nTaylor and her brother, Austin, grew up spending weekends and summers at Stone Harbor on the New Jersey shore on the family's 210 Sundeck. \"It was our way of life,\" Scott says. But Taylor was signed to a development deal by RCA when she was 12 and Nashville called. The family discov- ered Old Hickory Lake, and a house with a dock where they now keep their 420 Sundancer and 220 Sundeck bought from Erwin Marine.\n\"I've always loved boat- ing with my family, and now living on Old Hickory we can do it almost anytime we want,\" Taylor says. \"Signing with Big Machine just adds another level of excite- ment all together.\"\nLook for music from this rising star toward the end of the year, and an article on the Swift family in an upcoming issue of Sea Ray Living.\nSEA RAY\nChinese businessman Mr. Sheng is celebrating two firsts: his first boat and its status as the first imported pleasure boat in Shanghai. Sheng, a property and real estate developer, purchased his 525 Sundancer from Brunswick Mercury Marine in China. Kai Kai, named after Sheng's 12-year-old son, will be used mainly to entertain govern- ment officials and business partners on the Huangpu River, located at the end of the Changjiang (or Yangtze), China's longest river. Though pleasure boating is still in the preliminary stages in China, this Sea Ray will no doubt bring more enthusiasts onboard.\nHOLE-IN-WON\nForget that green jacket-hit the links for a Sea Ray. After sinking a hole-in-one at the annual Northwest Suburban Alliance for Commerce and Industry golf outing, Sean Hickey won a 180 Sport. The account- ant and avid golfer aced the 13th hole at Poplar Creek Country Club in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. Fred Santogrossi of Fox Valley Marine presented Sean and his wife, Paula, with the 180. \"This is such a nice gift,\" says Paula. \"We can't wait to get out on the water and relax.\" Gives you another reason to hit the driving range more often, doesn't it?",

      "Transcript/Content": "\"Got the radio on, my old blue jeans and I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve,\" Taylor Swift sings on \"A Place in This World,\" a self-penned coming-of-age anthem from her debut album due out this fall on Big Machine Records. It's an apt description of the enthusiastic, down-to-earth young woman, whose original compositions about teenage life brim with poignant honesty and an infectious spirit.\n\nJust 16 years old, Taylor is at an age when most teenagers are only beginning to find their identity and lay tentative plans for the future. But there's never been much doubt in Taylor's mind about her calling. Growing up on a farm in Wyomissing, Pa., music was ever-present in her home. Inspired by her maternal grandmother, a professional opera singer, Taylor took up singing early in life. At 10, she began performing around town at karaoke contests, festivals and county fairs, and even recording rough demos at a studio. At 11, she performed the national anthem at a Philadelphia 76ers NBA game in front of thousands of fans.\n\nBut it wasn't until she picked up a guitar at 12 and learned to write her own songs that Taylor discovered how readily she could channel the turbulent emotions of growing up into her music. That year, she wrote \"The Outside,\" a heartbreaking lament about loneliness. Before long, she was spending every available moment playing and writing. \"I was playing four hours a day until my fingers were bleeding and my mom called me to dinner,\" she says.\n\nNo strangers to the music business, Taylor's family recognized both her talent and determination. They began taking regular trips to Nashville to shop her music around, and she began writing with local songwriters. After a few years, during which the family made the decision to move to nearby Hendersonville, Tenn., a showcase at the Bluebird Cafe caught the attention of music-industry veteran Scott Borchetta, who was planning to launch a new label. After meeting with Taylor, he knew she was one of the first artists he wanted to sign.\n\nSince then, Taylor has pulled double duty as a straight-A high school student and full-fledged recording artist, a balancing act the teenager handles with grace. \"I have tunnel vision as far as this goes,\" she says. \"I can always keep my eyes on the goal.\" Still, she admits sheepishly, there are moments when songwriting inspiration strikes in the middle of a lecture, making concentration difficult. \"If we had random notebook checks, my teachers might find biology notes, biology notes, then suddenly a bunch of lyrics,\" she laughs.\n\nThe songs Taylor scrawls in those spiral notebooks are bright, engaging melodies filled with all the ebullience and drama of adolescent life. In \"Our Song,\" the narrator bemoans the fact she and her boyfriend don't share a sentimental tune, only to have him affectionately describe all the little moments that make their relationship special. \"Our song is the way you laugh,\" he tells her.\n\nLike all songwriters, Taylor is inspired by the life going on around her, and like any 16-year-old, she admits to a \"fascination\" with love. Thus, her classmates—her biggest fans, she says—often find themselves the subject of her songs. \"They're all going to buy the album and have a little bit of a heart attack,\" she says with a grin.\n\nA country superstar—and one of Taylor's greatest influences—was also surprised to find himself the subject of her debut single. A tender ballad, \"Tim McGraw\" describes the way music can evoke the sweetest of memories: \"When you think Tim McGraw/I hope you think my favorite song/The one we danced to all night long.\"\n\nElsewhere on the album, Taylor tackles more serious issues. \"Tied Together With a Smile,\" captures the fragile self-esteem of teenagers, inspired by girls Taylor has known through the years, including a beauty-pageant queen who suffered from an eating disorder: \"Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty/Is the face in the mirror looking back at you.\" In the second verse, she laments lack of confidence sometimes leads girls her age to make hasty and reckless decisions about their relationships: \"I guess it's true that love was all you wanted/'Cause you're givin' it away like it's extra change.\"\n\nSuch flashes of maturity give weight to songs that otherwise sparkle with the carefree joie de vivre of youth. Taylor admits her primary agenda with her music is to evoke a strong emotional response. \"I want to make people feel things,\" she says simply.\n\nAs she prepares an album with that in mind, Taylor is careful not to let her \"tunnel vision\" keep her from enjoying every moment of her budding music career. \"Everything about this business is exciting to me,\" she says, \"whether it's putting on a pretty dress to go to an awards show, or putting on a sweatshirt to go into the studio to record.\"\n\n\"You only get so many firsts,\" she adds. \"Every one is a blessing.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Taylor Swift's Climb To Stardom Takes The Next Step With Release Of Her First Single\n\nFor Hendersonville teen Taylor Swift, 16 has been sweet indeed. Most girls would've had their year made by the driver's license and prom invitation alone. But not Swift, who moved to Hendersonville with her family two years ago to make it big in the country music industry. Since then her steady rise has included a songwriting deal with Sony Music Publishing, a record deal with Big Machine Records and a television series chronicling her rise to stardom on Great American Country (GAC). \nAnd while this year just keeps getting sweeter - first with a waltz down the carpet at the CMT Video Awards, and then at the Academy of Country Music Awards - the biggest test of whether or not her star will continue to rise could come as early as June 19. \nThat's when her debut single \"Tim McGraw\", - one of close to 200 songs she has written or co-written - officially hits the airways. \nUnofficially, WSIX debuted the bittersweet ballad last Thursday night on its \"New Music Square Off\" hosted by Slam Duncan. Billed as a Faith Hill versus \"Tim McGraw\" battle, the show pitted Swift's song against Hill's latest release, \"Sunshine and Summertime\".\nAccording to program director Keith Kaufman, calls were taken for 20 minutes after the songs were played and Swift's single beat Hill's with 91% of the votes - the biggest margin of victory by any artist on the \"Square Off\" over the past year.\n\"At first I thought that it would be a little unfair to put Taylor, a brand new artist, up against Faith,\" said Duncan in a written statement, \"but the I remembered the saying, \"If you want to be the best, you gotta beat the best\" and with an amazing 91% of the folks voting for her, she sure did.\"\nAlthough Swift admitted she was a bit surprised at the choice to make \"Tim McGraw\" her first release - a decision made by record company executives - she said it is one of her favorites because, like most of what she writes, it is so personal. \"This is my story,\" she added. \"It's something I've gone through.\"\nAnd chances are, she's not alone. The song about a young couple who has broken up but remain forever bonded by a country music melody, conjures up images similar to Deana Carter's \"Strawberry Wine\" as well as just about any Tim McGraw song.\nAnd where was Swift when her song hit the airwaves for the first time? Determined to hear it over a car radio, she stood in her driveway surrounded by her mom, dad, brother and best friend with the windows rolled down and her song dancing across Old Hickory Lake.\n\"I was just jumping up and down,\" said Swift. \"I can't even explain it. I had chills all over my body. It felt like six years of working so hard finally paid off in 2 minutes.\" Several radio stations across the country have already added the song to their playlists added Swift's mother Andrea.\nWith her debut album scheduled for release early this fall, Swift admits she has a busy summer ahead of her touring radio stations and promoting her single. And while her album could hit at about the time she shouldbe returning to Hendersonville High for her junior year, the honor student with a 4.0 grade point avarage said she may look for other ways like a private tutor to continue her education. She admits she'll miss her friends who have been so supportive of her endeavor.\n\"No matter what path you go down in life, you're going to miss something,\" she noted philosophically. \"It's the price I'm willing to pay.\"\nWhether or not the sacrifices she makes pay off before her 17th birthday in December remain to be seen. In the meantime, she'll keep writing songs, singing them to whomever will listen and promoting her debut single.\n\"I'm having the time of my life,\" she said the soulful teen with the shimmering blonde hair and deep blue eyes. \"I feel like I'm finally getting somewhere.\"",

Crook and Chase here, and just to put it simply, we think that you were going to be amazed with this edition of Nashville Chats. Now. Music fans are well aware of the global success of Taylor Swift, right, I mean the worldwide tours, millions of albums sold, even being dubbed Artist of the Decade. Well, this iconic success was launched from Nashville's music row, and we were there and witnessed the blast off. Indeed, now on this edition of Chats, we delve into our archives and I we're gonna bring to you from two thousand six, the very first interview we ever did with a then sixteen year old Taylor Swift. Now, as you listen, you're going to quickly understand that hard work, dedication, actually obsession to a point, is what it's taken to achieve her spot in music history. But more importantly, just how brilliant she is in relaying who she is and why so at this point in two thousand and six, Taylor is still in high school, So yes, in addition to the music, we'll touch upon topics like her favorite subjects in school. That answer will surprise you. Her observation of high school drama, including her own, also pickup trucks, what kind of a driver she really is, her parents influence, and just so much more. All Right. It was June two thousand six, and Taylor's first single and later first top ten titled Tim McGraw, had just been released a few days earlier, so naturally she was really excited about promoting her new music. So we got the call from her record label that they had a new artist they were really high on and would we be interested in talking with her? So we always enjoy meeting newly signed artists, and of course we were quick to say yes with this particular request. So in walks this beautiful and confident young lady with a warm smile and a guitar case, and wait till you hear her perform for us. Here is our first experience with Taylor Swift from two thousand six. Are you just really taller as that chair? Really hot? You know, it's a little bit of both. I'm about five ten. She's got the model here. You know, I wore my boots today, but I'm not nearly as tall sneakers deciding let's see what you have here on the New News. Let's what we've got. Land Rhyme's interview One Trent Woman. Where's Taylor Swift? Yeah? See this is what Taylor Swift is over here. So I met you last year at the big Toby Keith party when you were being coming out party, so to speak, music industry awesome. So were you? Were you shell shocked at that time? You know, I don't think either ever been shell shocked, because, um, it's been so long. I mean I first came to Nashville with a little demo c D of me singing karaoke Dixie Chick songs when I was eleven years old and knocking on all the record labels doors saying Hi, my name is Taylor and I want a record deal. And so, I mean it's been ever since then. It's just been trying and trying and trying. I moved to Nashville when I was thirteen and got my first development deal. Then I got a publishing deal and started riding around town with every writer and just really honing in on my craft and establishing myself as a songwriter. And then Um, you know, had a little showcase with Mr Scott Borshetta and a bunch of other labels. Had a lot of choices, but Um, Scott said to me, you know what, I'm working on something I can't tell you right now. I can't say it over the phone. Um, but I'm going to ask you to wait for me. And I did, and he eventually told me that he was going to start a new record labels when we went back up. So you had the opportunity to go with some other labels, and you decided to wait on a brand new, unproven label even though it is run by a proven Yeah. I mean, you know the difference was I knew that Scott was gonna let me write every song on the album. I knew just from playing for him one time. Is that important? It's been so important to me because I've always tried to be really real with fans and people who I'm trying to sell music with. I've always been really tried to be honest with them. And you know, they're not stupid. They can tell when something isn't real and when someone's just trying to pitch him something that was just thrown together by a committee or something. I've always tried to really put forth my music and stuff that I've written, because that's who I am and that's my music. Charlie, is this maturity or what I think sixteen year olds would just be worried about, Oh, my makeup and my hair and I want to be fit and that's all they care about. But where did you get this maturity and this belief in in the power of music, which I I feel that you have. Thank you so much. I think it really comes from how I was raised. And my parents are very driven people. They aren't musicians, but everything that they tried to go for they were they were going to get. And they're very much like Scott Borchetta. And I've really tried to surround myself with people who believe in me and also believe in themselves a lot, and that's really influenced me. And you know what, I love it. You know you have to love it. I hear a lot of artists talk about, well, you know, you have to separate your personal life with your job and realize, you know, this is a job, and you can't let it bog you down. But it's not a job. It's never been a job for me, and I've I've never even looked at it as a job. It's it's what I think about when I wake up in the morning, and it's it's what I do, and it's what I need, and it's what I am obsessing over, constantly thinking how can I make myself better. You're allowed to do that during the summer, but you also go to school. I do well. Actually, I've been out for the summer for a week, so okay, And I will have you know that I had straight a's this year, so that's pretty impressive. So I'm trying to figure out how your day would be in order to focus on the music the way you want to yet maintain a straight A. Well, um, you know. It's I think it all comes down to who I am and being I'm very unartist like in the fact that I have to have everything organized all the time, and everything has to be planned out perfectly, and what am I doing here? And then how am I getting there? And and this is going to happen and everything has to be done and taken care of by the end of the day, or I'm not going to sleep that night because I'm gonna be thinking about it. So you know, if you think about it, if you've if you're on a bus from Bristol to you know, Knoxville, and you can take one of those hours that you could be sleeping and study. Why not? Why would you be on a bus anyway from because you talked about schools eight days and all that, and I'm sure and listening to this song Tim mcgrawl, which I think it's just a wonderful, simply put song that everyone has thought about. Thank you taking a song that is theirs and you signal out Tim McGraw, by the way you met him, I have not Okay, well this this, this will this will do? The track don't work? Uh no, back to the song here. Do you rely on drama in high school? And you know as well as I do. High school is filled with drama, drama, drama, drama? You got is there where you get a lot of the ideas and are with that in mind? Are your friends kind of hesitant to hang with you? Well? People always a lot of people look at me and say, well, how can you be writing about this stuff? You're sixteen, and really in response when you're a teenager, think about all the emotions that are going on right then, and everything is intense. Everything is oh my god, if he does not call me, I'm going to die. You know, everything is intensified. And so, you know, even listening to my friends speak not even you know, yes, I draw a lot from my own personal experiences, but even listening to my friends talk about what they're going through is just so you know, it's like they're saying songs right there. It's like they're speaking and song lyrics are coming out. Wait a minute, don't you experience that drama that you're talking about. Is it only your friends who suffered from I'm not saying I don't go through my own my own drama every once in a while, but I try to keep the drama out of all time low because, you know, being doing what I do, it has gives me a lot to think about. So I try not to think about. You know, well, she said that, she heard you say that, You said that, he said that, you know not. I we haven't recorded right now. So here's the thing. What song have you written to date that you feel is the most personal about you, and what was it about. Well, I wrote a song called tear Drops on my guitar and I cut it on this album, and it's about out a guy I was best friends with, and he would always sit there in class and tell me about this new girl that he'd fallen in love with, and he would just go on and on about how he'd you know, I can't believe I got it right, Taylor, aren't you so? Oh my god, I'm so happy. I'm finally happy. You know, Taylor, isn't that great? And I'd have to sit there and look at him and just be like, yeah, that's that's great. And I just couldn't take it. And one day I went home and just wrote this song and it's got his name in it, and I don't think he's ever heard it. And I hope one day he goes and buys the album and is just like, oh my god, but they're still together. So so but here's so, here's the thing. You couldn't take it because you wanted to. Yeah, it was he had no idea. He had no idea. I have a really, I have a way of maintaining friendships with people and they don't know, you know, I can hide it pretty well if I I want to. So I guess that was That's the most personal song I've ever written, because the lyrics are so just painful. It's just like some of the lyrics are he says he's so in love, he's finally got it right. I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night. Oh my, oh my. So it's you're too young to be feeling these I started writing this stuff twelve years sol. I started writing songs when I was twelve, when I first picked up a guitar and started playing. And I mean I say I started playing every single day. It was like four hours and I would not put the guitar down until my parents were like, you really need to stop. I think your fingers are bleeding and you need to go eat because you need to eat dinner. So I mean I started playing, and then about a day later, I wrote my first song. And actually I think on the second song that I wrote was is one called the Outside, and we actually cut it on the album. So there's a song I wrote on there from when I was twelve. Okay, you're listening to Taylor Swift at age sixteen? Okay, In our first interview with her. In a moment, we're gonna learn what her parents were thinking about her poems or songs, I mean, considering what she was writing about. Were they concerned and what it's like being in high school at that point. I'm sure straight a's However, everybody, including all your teachers, know what you're up to. So how was Taylor and everybody else around her handling all that? The answers are on the way. This is Crook and Chase National Chats with Taylor Swift from two thousand and six.

Now you're writing songs at a very early age about emotions, love and very insightful stuff. When your parents see the sort of thing, do they have a tendency. I don't want to have you checked. I mean, you know, I think as long as they see that it's going into something good. I mean, if I if I was, you know, on crack because I couldn't handle my emotions, I think they have a problem with it. But writing songs and as as big a problem and very creative resource that you have built within. It's fascinating that you've been able to find it this early and cultivated. I'm very I'm very fortunate to have found what I love. Okay, So here's the thing. I've been all over your sites, okay, And on part of the site where it has some of your lyrics and we can listen to snippets of some of your songs, there is a picture of a little pencil there that's just it's really short and it's like I'll chewed up and the erasers to So my question is that really a pencil that you write with or is that just an effect for your Well? Actually, um, I did. My website company is Mad Dancer, but my mom has a lot to do with it. They she does all the updating and stuff. And so they asked me when we initially created the site, you know, give us a couple of personal things that we can you know, scan onto here, put onto here. And the pencil actually was one of the things. And I told him my favorite flower was an orchid, so they put one of those on there. And you know, the pins are really cool. It's a really cool site, y'all. Go to w w A dot Taylor Swift dot com. Please. The reason I asked about that pencil is because I'm wondering if that's really something that you used to write with. It looks like you are extremely intense if you are just chewing on that the whole time you're writing, I have no comment at all. I don't showing my pencils. I swear my dog got ahold of its her dog? Who speaking of homework in school that sort of thing. Um, you're able to maintain that straight a average, but you're writing some wonderful songs. The two ever collide in the middle of the day at school? Yes, actually, um, well, I'll be sitting there in class and I'll just have something come to me that half of my songs are started that way, where I'll just something. I'll just I'll just be like, oh you think Tim McGraw, Hey, that's kind of cool, And I'll quick get out my cell phone and record a voice memo. And of course everyone around me is looking at me like I'm possessed or something. But you know, songs hit you at all sorts of times, and it's just crazy when they when the time comes for you to hear a song. I've had to sneak out of class, and UM, go to the piano room in the chorus room and just get something down because I needed to at that point. Now, do your teachers support you that they obviously know what you're doing. They do know what I do, and most of them are very very supportive. UM. I don't ask for any slack on assignments. I've never turned anything in late Um. I've always been very serious that way. But you know, the administrative office is really great because they let me miss a lot of days of school because I'll be out on the road or I'll be doing stuff, and they know. I mean, I'm not skipping school right, I'm really busy. So as long as they know that, I take it seriously. You know, this pose is a very interesting question. You're in what your school now? I was a sophomore this year. Okay, so you're going to be a junior and you have a lot of things. You have a lot of big decisions that are going to be facing here in the next few years. And I'm curious if you plan on going to college after this. You know, I think I'm really going to play it my ear. I'd really like to continue my schooling. But you know, tutoring I think it's probably gonna occur for this next year. You know, I've heard junior year is hard anyway, and I kind of rather, you know, do do my own thing and go tutoring. A lot of people look at me and are just like, you are going to miss out on your high school experience. And you know, I figured, no matter what path you choose, when you're going throughout life, you're going to miss out on something. You're you're gonna miss something that you would have done, and you're always going to have to deal with what could have been. And I feel like if I go through my junior and senior year of high school and graduate class of two thousand and eight, I'm going to be missing out on something that absolutely would have made my life worthwhile for every single day that I was doing it. The music, the music. I like going to school, but I love what I'm doing right now sitting here talking to y'all. This is a once in a lifetime. You could always go back to high school if you want to. Super senior. So how are you? How are you doing this? You are living at the same time into very different worlds, big business, music and trying to be a regular high school student. How's that working out? It's working out really well. Um g. A C actually did a special on me called Shortcuts, which is a mini series kind of dealing with my double life, you know, and how I'll go to school and my actor school. After school activities include going to the studio, writing songs, getting on a bus, traveling places, and talking to radio people. So it's just like, you know, it's been really cool that they've been able to follow me and get me some exposure. And I got to see myself on TV, which was so much fun. And I sat there just like completely giddy, like a little kid. I mean, I don't take anything for granted in this business. Every little step, every little good thing is just so important to me. I mean I got my first AD the other day and I was about to go on stage in Las Vegas, and I was I was like seriously about to start crying. I was like, to go on stage. I have to go on stage. But it was just so exciting for me, so so for people listening. And AD is is that your music is being played. It's basically it's acceptance at one at one radio station, yes, and one was enough to really really make me make my day and make my ways? Um, you signed a record deal and or sixteen works. I signed a development deal with our c A when I was thirteen, and then I signed one with Scott Wish had is Laid label that was a full on record deal when I was fifteen. Alright, so a big time record deal at age fifteen. Immediately I got some dreams and goals start circulating in your mind? Could you share those? You know? Dreams and goals have been circulating in my mind since I was ten years old, and it's just bittersweet to actually switch roles from being the fan too, possibly someone who could have fans, you know. Instead of being the kids standing behind the first row of the barricade at the awards show, the Country Music Awards show, I'm the person walking down the red carpet, And it's unbelievable when you think about it. It's just I always tried to every single fan, every single letter, every single email. I write them back, and I want to do it all personally because I appreciate it so much because I was them. We're in the world, did you learn to be who you are? Meaning? I'm sure you've heard that there are media training schools where people even much older than you who are becoming artist learn how to be themselves, how to uh speak into a microphone for an interview, how to conduct themselves on a red carpet. It seems to me this is just either natural or you learned it from watching television when you were younger. Have this happened? Um? I have heard about media schools and I've never been to one, But um, you know, I don't think you should need a school to tell you who you are. I think if you've gotten to the point where you've got a record label and you've got a deal and you've got a single coming out, you better know who you are. But then, or you're selling something that's not real. You won't work in the long run, will it. It won't? You know? You can put on an act for however long you want, but you really should know. It makes it so much easier to not have to look at note cards to answer questions, because isn't that the biggest question among high school students? I know, I think it's universal. When I was young, we all were like, you know, who am I? And what do I want to do? And what kind of a person am I? Really? So how do you How did you know this at such a young age. I'm just very blessed. And you know, music, I'm so lucky that music has guided who I am as a person. To you know, it's there are my friends who play soccer that's not gonna define them as a personality, and they've had to do it themselves and they've had to figure out who they are. And I'm very lucky that I haven't been. I haven't had to do that because music, to me is so engulfing that it really has made my personality and the fact that music is going to take drive, it's made me driven. The fact that getting my music dream is gonna take perseverance, it's made me. It's made me have that trade to it. It's really an amazing career and I'm just so lucky. Yes, an amazing career. Back then, already it is iconic. You are listening to our very first Crook and Chase interview with Taylor Swift back in two thousand six. She was just getting started. Her maturity is astounding. Well, coming up, we'll have a little fun learning about Toler's favorite weird food snack combinations. Back then, also creating magic in the studio, what it's like being sixteen and driving in Nashville, and what she would see herself doing other than music. Her answer isn't what you'd expect. And remember Taylor brought her guitar, so wait for it. This is Crook and Chase Nashville chats with sixteen year old Taylor Swift from two thousand six.

You said, drive driver's license. Yeah I do. I've had my license since December, my birthday. And she loves trucks. Did you buy a truck? I love trucks. I did not buy a truck. Um, um, you know, I still am looking towards the truck dream. But my dream truck is a Ford F two fifty King Ranch. Don't that sound amazing? Why number one? Why do you like trucks and why do you love that one? Well? Um, I like trucks because they're big and just really cool and they're so country and I mean, and the sound they make is amazing the diesel. It's awesome. And you know, the interior, if you've ever seen a King ranch interior, they're amazing. They have saddle bag leather and they're just, oh, it's like an art form. And I used to go, like when I was really bored, I used to have my dad take me over to the car lot and I would get to just get to sit in it. And I would just sit there and I'd be like, one day, I will I will own you. One day you'll be saying that to a man. One day I am going to own you. You're from Pennsylvania, but are you from the country in Pennsylvania. I was raised on a farm, and you know, my mom always thought I was going to be a horseback rider. And I had to stop riding because I realized, you know, I wanted to be a country singer, and it was it took up too much time. And you know, riding was a really big part of my life, and I think developed, you know, me liking country music to appreciating living on a farm. Going up in the farms of Pennsylvania. It doesn't sound like, you know, I grew up on a farm in Pennsylvania. It sounds like an oxymoron. But you know there are some great country fans up there. Yes, In fact, you know Charlie and I. Over the years, the two places we've gotten the most fan mail from for our television and radio shows are Texas and Pennsylvania. Oh yeah, Pennsylvania. I mean we love country music. Yeah, if you fall right into a very interesting category we've been featuring on our show lately, which is weird Food Wednesday. In other words, you want a midnight snack, You get in there and things are kind of low in the pantry and refrigerator and you just have to get by with what you have. Now. Teenagers usually come up with some of the most unusual food commodations. Yeah, we have tried free does and mustard. We have tried sandwiches featuring pickles, bologna and peanut, butternut butter and mustard. What weird food combodation really set you afloat cookie dough and whipped cream unbaked cookie dough. You have to try something it's really good. Me and my friend I have a best friend named Abigail, and she hears all my songs first, and when we're sitting there, we're like, and I think it's time for some cookie dough, like if she's going through a bad break up for whatever. Please don't look at me like that. Cream. I've never heard of that. Can you describe the taste cookie dough? Um, it's really good. You've gotta get the sugar cookie dough and you've gotta it's got to be nestle, and it's got to be the squares so that it's like an individual serving size and you just dip it into some whip cream. Yeah, you do. You know, I don't try it with whip cream a lot, but since the combination is um, you know, sort of a requirement here, I think that'd be kind of cool. Okay, we'll try it. We're okay. So what are you looking forward to about traveling across America? Oh, my gosh, I really just look forward to the radio stations. I don't. I really like radio stations, and I really like you know, it's such an honor when they put me on the radio. When I walk in and I'll play for him in the programmer's office and they'll just put me on the air. That to me is like touchdown. Yes, my life is complete. And you know, sometime soon I might get a second AD and a third AD. I think I'm gonna still be like crying happiness when I get you know, my fifteenth AD and sixteenth AD, and it's just every step is I look forward to it even more than the next one before it, you know, I look forward to little girls coming up to me and saying that, you know, oh my god, I'm your biggest fan, or something like that like I used to do to Leanne rhymes. Just if that would happen. It's just unbelievable the fact that I'm getting to have a chance at this. Okay, but think big. Tricia Yearwood told us one of the biggest moments of her life was when she got to go to Europe and sing with one of the greatest opera singers of all time, Pararatti. Kenny Jesney said, you know, I've met the President of the United States. I can quit now. So so think you your biggest what's your biggest dream? Miranda Laverett. Don't you love her? I love her. I'm obsessed with her. If I got to do like a like like a crossroads or something, or like a concert with her, just sing a song with her one time, I mean I would consider myself there. You two are very much alike, really, Oh the way that you write from the hart who you are with your music. She's amazing. She her album is like therapy. I mean, if you're going through anything, you can find it's like a little dictionary. You can go through her album and find something that's a remedy for what you're going through. She's absolutely amazing. What's your favorite song on her album? Greyhound for Nowhere? Okay, minus I want to Die You're the death of made Dolling. I want to die. I'm there. That was all I needed. I have to ask you this question. You have been quoted as saying that your producers Nathan Chapman is like it is, and you say that you love working with him because he gets you. He understands what you want to do with your music. So how do you describe that to other people? What you and he are trying to do or say with your music when you record. Well, I think the difference between Nathan and all the other producers I've really worked with is that he listens to me. And you know, I've been in demo sessions before with producers well where I've had to scream and be like look, This is not an electric guitar song. This is I need dough bro and I need mando, and I need organic instruments, and I need brushes on the drum, and I needed a key lower and I need you know, it's just like, you really have to go into that because you have to know what you want it to sound like. As soon as I write a song, I know exactly how I wanted to sound. And Nathan really listens to what ideas I have, you know, And if I want a certain banjo like, I'll just sing it to him or I'll play it on guitar and he'll just he'll do it and it'll sound amazing because he's so open minded. But you know, were you concerned or worried at all about walking into this town with all these high powered people and asking for these things and people thinking, well, who is this little twit telling us what to do? Did you worry that they would be offended by the fact that you're so young? But you know what you want. The only thing that I've ever been scared of is being average. Oh now that was beautifully said. Thank you. That's the only thing I've ever been scared of. I don't care if they throw me out of the studio because they think that I'm, you know, being too stubborn. If it needs to sound good, if I'm going to be trying to sell this to people, it needs to be good for them, and it's not. It's not because I'm being selfish. It's because it needs to be good for them. And I need to be proud of when I'm putting out there. I can't do something halfway. It's got to be great. I love how bold you are. Thank you know that's good. We need more of that around here. We've got a good education under your belt there, thank you. Um, I need to go back to school here for just a second. Great. No, No, I'm just trying to think. No, I will never be homecoming, queen. No. I was in radio, went all through high school, just like you were in songwriting. So you are yeah, well oh yeah, I was thirteen when I got into radio. I'm curious, Oh, what was your favorite subject in school? English? Definitely, because it had contributed to the writing. Which one did you not like? Oh? You know, the list is longer, The list is getting longer. Oh and I also loved criminal justice. This year I had criminal justice and that was amazing. Yeah, that was really good. I'm very assassinated by that. I think if I wasn't a singer, i'd be a cop or detective. Think of the reality series they could do on that. But the subject I don't really like. I don't as much like math, and because I don't like rules as much, you know, and following a certain pattern. I'm very artsy like that. I mean, I'm good, I can get an A in the class, but it's I don't really appreciate math for what it is. Did you take driver's Head when you're in school? I took Driver's Head during the summer because it's not a class at my school, but I did. I took it during summer, and that was interesting. I mean, should be a pretty good driver. I'm pretty good driver. You know. I'm not good at getting into rex. I'm just bad at avoiding them. Okay, that was a little um, yes, exactly. Yeah, we'll see. During springbreak I had two rex and the first one, the first one, I was stopped at a red light and a truck carrane into the back of me. Stopped. That's not my fault, come on now. And then the second one, I was driving down you know, one of those one way streets in Nashville, and they're two lanes, and the other guy in the other lane decided he wanted to be in my lane and not shake if I was there first. So that's not my fault either. So I promise I'm a good driver. If you don't be scared that I'm out there on the road unsupervised, Promise I won't kill you. Daryl Waltrip just ruined it for amazing. You get to speed away and have a little bit of speed fun when you did that commercial. I got to do a NASCAR commercial, yes, and it was amazing. I got to meet Darryl Waltrip. And you know, I didn't get to drive the red Corvette as much as I thought I would. I had a body double who drove the car really fast. No. Yeah, but the upside issue is really pretty so well, so are you. I was quite excited about that. Weren't you involved in some sort of Abercrombie. I was. I was when I was fourteen. They picked me for their first Rising Stars campaign. So I mean, if this whole thing works out, I could just go in Abercrombie and be like, y'all are smart y'all were ahead of the game, were featured in the store and everything. People people have seen a lot of you. I went into the store because I was shocked there and it was kind of weird because my picture was like huge on the wall and that was just amazing. Thanks Abercroll me. I like you a lot. I never can't hear anything in there when the music. Yeah, so show us why you are a rising star. You want to play something? You brought your guitar. I did, all right, Now, what what do you think it's important for us to hear? I think it's important for you to hear my first single. Okay Tim McGraw, Mr McGraw, Snap, yes, that's all right. So while you're getting the guitar, when you finally do meet Mr McGraw, have you planned what you might say to him? You know, I have no idea. I just don't. I just you know, play it by your I don't want him to think that I'm obsessed and crazy and what do you think we are? Yeah? By the way, and I'm like your rodeo over here? Do you even do with the case? Every Those are those those papers falling out? Those are yeah? Material? Yeah, that's I mean, I usually keep him in a lab under a under heavy. That's the next a fiberglass, but whatever. But this is a song that I wrote called Tim McGraw and it's my first single, comes out June nineteen. If you want to be my best friend, requested on the radio this is and this is called Tim McGraw. When do you think, Timmer? I hope you my favorite song. Only to answer you all that thinking my head on your atchist Emma old faded dude jeans and give thanks, Timberg, I hope you're thinking me. A little snippet of Taylor Swift performing for us for the very first time in our studio. And you know, when I went back to review this interview the other day before we put it here on the chat, I've forgotten just how brilliant Taylor was at that first session with us. A matter of fact, I called Laurian immediately and I said, hey, this is special. And after listening to it again, it's so easy to understand how she's been able to accomplish everything that she has well, I mean talking about her intelligence. Social media was still in its infancy, but Taylor was all over it from the get go, and she created a following of millions of fans still has them to this day. So really telling people about our first visit with Taylor is one of our favorite stories about the magic that goes on right here in Nashville.

      "Transcript/Content": "GAC Gets Exclusive Premiere of New Taylor Swift Video\n20 July 2006, Business Wire.\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. - (BUSINESS WIRE) - July 20, 2006 - Great American Country will bring viewers the world premiere of the inaugural video project from singer/songwriter Taylor Swift. Titled \"Tim McGraw,\" the video will debut on GAC on Saturday, July 22, at 2:30 p.m. ET following GAC's \"On the Streets.\" The network will have exclusive television rights to the video for 10 days.\n\nGAC helped to introduce Swift to the world this summer. The 16-year old high school student from Hendersonville, Tenn., is the subject of \"GAC Short Cuts,\" a series of short-form features that document Swift's pursuit of a career in country music.\n\n\"GAC viewers have gotten to know a little about Taylor and her music this summer, and we are happy to have the opportunity to tell more of her story by being the first to show her first video,\" said Sarah Trahern, senior vice president of programming for GAC.\n\n\"Tim McGraw\" broke into the Top 40 on the country charts this week. Although the song's title carries the name of the country music superstar, its lyrics make only passing reference to McGraw, instead telling the story of how a particular tune on the radio ignites long-dormant passion.\n\n\"It deals with the haunting power of music and how hearing a song years after it was first popular can have such an emotional appeal,\" Swift said.\n\nThe single is the first release from Swift's self-titled album, due out in October.\n\n\"Taylor Swift is a very important new artist and the folks at GAC saw that immediately. Their initial commitment with the groundbreaking 'GAC Short Cuts' provided the perfect lead-in to introduce Taylor to their viewership,\" said Scott Borchetta, president and CEO of Big Machine Records.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Eyes on the prize; Up-and-coming country singer-songwriter determined to succeed\nBy Wayne Bledsoe, 21 July 2006, The Knoxville News-Sentinel.\n\nThere is very little typical about Taylor Swift. Unlike most country music hopefuls, she insists on writing or co-writing all of her own songs. And unlike most 16-year-olds, she is completely focused, surprisingly articulate and absolutely driven.\n\nA native of Wyomissing, Pa., Swift began writing songs at an age when a lot of her peers were still learning how to spell \"prodigy.\"\n\n\"I started singing at all kinds of places when I was 10,\" says Swift, in a call from Hendersonville, Tenn. \"I was dragging my parents to karaoke nights, festivals, open-mic nights. ... At 11, I came to town (Nashville) and passed out a demo of me singing karaoke and said, 'My name is Taylor Swift, and I want to record an album. Call me.' \"\n\nFive years later, Swift's debut single, \"Tim McGraw,\" is currently nudging its way up the country charts. It stands at No. 42 on the Billboard Country Songs chart and at No. 38 on the corresponding Radio and Records chart. Her debut album, \"A Place in This World,\" set for release this fall, will include one song Swift wrote when she was only 12.\n\nSwift says it was after that first trip to Nashville that she realized she had to be more than a good singer:\n\n\"I went home and started writing songs. I knew I had to be different. In fact, I had to be different than anything they'd ever seen.\"\n\nSwift learned how to play a 12-string guitar and began writing in earnest. Her second song was called \"The Outside.\"\n\n\"That dealt with what was going on with me at that time,\" says Swift. \"I really was an outsider at school, and people were not nice about it. I was taller than everyone, and I liked country music.\"\n\nThe fact that she was pursuing a country music career also set her apart from her peers.\n\nAt 13, Swift was given a development deal with RCA Records, and she and her family moved to Hendersonville. A year later, she signed a songwriting contract with Sony. There were other offers, but Swift says Sony's Arthur Buenahora seemed to believe in her songs.\n\n\"You could always tell when someone was coming in with a condescending attitude,\" she says. \"Arthur said: 'Don't change this. Keep it just the way it is.' \"\n\nThe plan, though, was for Swift to save her songs for her own singing career, not to pitch them to other artists.\n\n\"For me, it's always been a pride issue,\" says Swift. \"It wasn't about the royalties. I didn't know anything about that. I just wanted to give anyone who bought my music as much of me as I could.\"\n\nShe says the only time she's been really starstruck since she came to Nashville is when she met Craig Wiseman, who wrote the Tim McGraw hit \"Live Like You Were Dying.\"\n\n\"I just think he's one of the most brilliant people. I was just looking at him and thinking, 'How could you write something like that?' I guess I'm starstruck by intelligence.\"\n\nShe also points out that while she's a fan of McGraw, her song \"Tim McGraw\" is not a tribute to McGraw, nor even about him. In fact, the song is about hoping a love thinks of her when he hears McGraw's music.\n\n\"I wrote the song about something I've gone through,\" says Swift.\n\nSwift isn't sure what the future will hold, but she's determined to give country music her best shot.\n\n\"I want to take this as far as I can possibly take it,\" she says. \"So many people made my life better with music, helped me through things I was going through. I'd like to do that with my music.\"\n\nAnd Hendersonville High School has worked out just fine, too.\n\n\"School is awesome now,\" says Swift. \"And I had a 4.0 last year.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift’s Nashville roots: A look back at musician’s early days in Music City\nby: Stephanie Langston\n\nSHARE\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — This weekend, Taylor Swift is performing in the city where she moved to chase her music dreams nearly two decades ago.\n\nHowever, the now-global superstar was nowhere near a household name when she made her way into the News 2 studios in 2006 to share the story behind her debut song, “Tim McGraw”, during one of her first TV appearances.\n\n“First thing I tell people who haven’t heard this song is that it’s not about Tim McGraw and I’m not a stalker,” then-16-year-old Swift said.\n\nTaylor Swift: How a Tennessee castle turned a fairy tale into a ‘Love Story’\nIt was Aug. 31, 2006 when the teenage singer sat down with News 2’s Stephanie Langston.  Swift’s mother was by her side, eager to take photos of her little girl’s opportunity.\n\n“It feels really good to be doing what I’m doing,” Swift explained. \n\nThat was two months before the release of her debut album. Swift, a junior, had left Hendersonville High School, where she found inspiration to write about teenage love and heartbreak.\n\nSwift took that music to 2nd Avenue’s Wildhorse Saloon in December 2006, which News 2 was able to witness. By then, not only was the song “Tim McGraw” in the top 10 on the music charts, but Swift had even chatted on the phone with the song’s namesake.\n\n“He was, like, ‘Well, to be honest, I felt really old,” Taylor recalled with a laugh. “He goes, ‘But I like the song and Faith likes it a lot,’ and I was, like, ‘Yes! Yes, that’s exciting.'”\n\nBy the end of the year, Swift had evolved from hyped teen newcomer to bona fide country artist.\n\nNews 2 aired more than 100 stories about Swift in the year after that first August interview, covering a slew of accolades that quickly followed her, such as hitting the road with George Strait, celebrating a gold album, and filming the music video for her single “Our Song”.\n\n“My ideal day is getting my hair and makeup done all day, so basically my ideal day is today,” Swift told News 2 from the set of the music video, saying she was trying out some new looks for the shoot. \n\nNearly 17 years later, one might wonder if her tune has changed, as what was once a dream has been a whirlwind of reality.\n\nSwifties travel from as far as Europe, Asia to see Taylor Swift perform in Nashville.\nAlthough Swift hung up her hat with country music, she dominates the air waves as one of the best-selling musicians in history.\n\n“I give myself, like, five seconds a day to be a complete cheerleader and be, like, ‘Oh my God, this is happening,’ and then the rest of the day, I think about what I’m going to do to make it last and make it keep happening,” she explained backstage at the Wildhorse Saloon in 2006.",

      "Transcript/Content": "At just 16, singer’s career is on track\nBy John Hayes, 23 September 2006, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nOvernight success can take a lifetime, particularly when your life is only 16 years old.\n\nFor Taylor Swift, a singer-songwriter from a suburb of Reading, Pa., next month's release of her debut CD on a hot Nashville label will be the result of a lifetime of hard work and something a lot of kids her age don't have: patience.\n\"It doesn't just happen,\" she says. \"You have to get rejected a bunch of times and just keep on doing it.\"\n\nSwift will perform tonight at Falconi Field in Washington, Pa., with Lonestar and Diamond Rio, and will sing the national anthem before tomorrow's Steelers game at Heinz Field. Her self-titled debut is bankrolled by Big Machine Records, which recently scored its first hit with Jack Ingram's \"Wherever You Are.\" Big Machine is partially bankrolled by Pittsburgh financier Ray Pronto.\n\nSwift has been cutting demo tapes since she was 10, wrote her first song at 12, and signed a publishing deal with Sony/ATV Music when she was 14. Her family moved to Nashville to support her music habit, and Swift has published 140 songs, including the new CD's single \"Tim McGraw,\" which isn't really about Tim McGraw.\n\n\"I came up with the title in math class,\" she says. \"I was dating this guy who was going off to college and thinking of what would remind him of me. One of the first things that came to mind was Tim McGraw, because we like his songs. But [the song's] not about Tim McGraw. He doesn't have to worry -- I'm not a stalker.\"\n\nPittsburgh country fans were among the first to hear Swift on the radio. Froggy programming director Frank Bell says he's known Swift since he worked at a station near Reading and has been a fan since she was 11. He rushed \"Tim McGraw\" onto the airwaves as soon as she signed with Big Machine.",

Even after they break up, every time they hear that song it takes them right back to that place.\"\nTaylor and actor Clayton Collins play out that story line in the video, which was shot a few months ago at a cabin that belonged to Johnny Cash in Hendersonville, just outside Nashville. \"It was absolutely amazing,\" notes Taylor. \"The building where we did makeup and hair was Johnny and June's studio. It was just unbelievable, all the history that goes along with being on that property.\"\nTaylor and director Trey Fanjoy even included a sneaky homage to the Man in Black by naming the male character in the video \"Johnny.\" \"That was my little tribute to Johnny Cash,\" says Taylor.\n\"Johnny was also the name of the first guy I ever had a crush on, when I was in second grade,\" she admits with a chuckle. \"He lived next door to us.\"\n-CHRIS NEAL",

      "Transcript/Content": "16-year-old scored her first hit single with ‘Tim McGraw’\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nupdated 6:58 p.m. CT, Tues., Nov. 21, 2006\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. – Country music promoter and veteran manager Jerry Bentley doesn’t care much for the prospects of most teenage singers.\n\nIn the business more than 30 years, he’s seen plenty of teenage careers crash, and he had some tough advice for the latest contender, 16-year-old Taylor Swift:\n\n“Tell her to get back in school and come back and see me when she’s 18, and bring her parents,” said Bentley, who’s managed singer Lee Greenwood for 23 years.\n\n“Even if she were 25, the odds would be against her. At 16, it’s near impossible. You have to work 300-plus days for a couple of years, and there’s no guarantee even then.”\n\nWarnings like that don’t faze Swift. When told about Bentley’s advice, she hardly flinched: “I’d like to meet him and sit down and play for him,” she said.\n\nSwift may be only a teenager, but she already has the nerves and determination of a steely veteran.\n\nHer first hit single, “Tim McGraw,” came off her self-titled debut album last month, and she’s just been chosen as the opening act for a George Strait tour beginning in January.\n\nOther kids her age are sitting in the audience at country shows; Swift was on stage recently as the opening act for Rascal Flatts, singing for more than 10,000 people in Moline, Ill.\n\nIntimidated?\n\n“Not by any measure,” she says. “I’m intimidated by the fear of being average.”\n\nAverage, she’s not.\n\n‘I’m 11 and I want a record deal’ She grew up on a farm in Wyomissing, Pa., a suburb of Reading, and was inspired to sing by her maternal grandmother, an opera singer.\n\nAt 11 she performed the national anthem at a Philadelphia 76ers NBA game, and then began showing up at record company offices telling anyone who would listen, “I’m Taylor, I’m 11 and I want a record deal.”\n\nShe began writing songs a year later. Now she’s got her first record deal at 16, drawing comparisons with LeeAnn Rimes and Tanya Tucker, who both broke through at 13.\n\nHowever, neither Rimes nor Tucker were known for their songwriting. Swift wrote or co-wrote every song on her 11-track CD.\n\n“I didn’t come in to this to be baby-sat,” Swift declared in an interview in a small basement conference room at Big Machine Records in the heart of Nashville’s Music Row.\n\nShe is homeschooled in order to focus on her music. With little spare time this fall, she went to the mall with a friend one day, but that was a rarity.\n\nShe managed to get to a high school football game in September at her old school, but missed homecoming because of career commitments. Likewise, she doesn’t go to parties with teenage friends.\n\n“BMI and Sony Music parties are the ones I like,” she said.\n\nHer hit “Tim McGraw,” which peaked at No. 14 on the Billboard country chart, namechecks country music’s reigning heartthrob. It’s a song about two people who fall in love to a McGraw song, break up and are reminded of each other whenever they hear the tune.\n\nShe and McGraw (whom she admires but has never met) have the same booking agent, who told Taylor that he played it for McGraw.\n\nHis response, according to the agent: “I’ve got to play it for Faith.” That’s Faith Hill, McGraw’s superstar wife.\n\nOther songs on Swift’s album are mostly about love, focused on forgiveness, determination, achievement and self-esteem.\n\nLiz Rose, who co-wrote seven of the songs, said Swift was born to be a singer-songwriter.\n\n“She’s a genius, coming in with ideas and a melody,” said Rose, 49. “She’d come in and write with this old lady, and I never second guessed her. I respect her a lot.”\n\nTaylor is undaunted about being in an industry dominated by singers, executives and songwriters often more than twice her age:\n\n“If you have a calling for it and are ready for it, more power to you. For me, the time is right.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Some people spend a lifetime looking for their true calling. Taylor Swift is not one of those people. By the time she was 10, this Wyomissing, Penn., native was \"dragging her parents to festivals, fairs karaoke contests just about anywhere there was a stage where she could get up and sing. A year later, she was in Nashville knocking on record company doors. Swift describes her sales pitch at the time as \"Hello, I'm Taylor Swift, I'm 11 and I want a record deal.\" She didn't get signed at 11, but she did walk away with some important lessons. \"That trip made me malize i needed to be different than everyone else people saw on Music Row every day, she said.\nSwift returned home got a 12-string guitar, taught herself how to play and jumped right into writing songs. \"I played about four hours a day until my parents made me stop to come and eat dinner.\" Swift said\"I loved it that much.\"\nMom and Dad finally relented, relocating to Nashville after Swift was offered a development deal. With a growing moord collection that included artists ranging from LeAnn Rimes to Tim McGraw to Sheryl Crow, Swift's after school hours were largely taken up with co-writing appointments. She was signed to Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing at 14.\nPerforming at a showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe, Swift was approached by label executive Scott Borchetta who was starting a new label. Big Machine Records. The young singer/songwriter was among his first signings and wrote or co-wrote every song on the album. Her leadoff single, \"Tim McGraw \"is already climbing the charts and her self-titled debut album (produced by Nathan Chapman) is set for release on Oct. 24.\nIN HER OWN WORDS:\nWhich song would you secretly like to cover?\n\"Vonda Sheppard's 'Baby Don't You Break My Heart Slow. It's got\nWhat CD is in your stereo?\nTim McGraw's CDs Live Like You Were Dying and Set This Circus Down, such simple lyrics, but they're lyrics that really make you feel.\" \"Little Big Town's The Road to Here, the new Corrine Bailey Rae CD.\nDo you have a lucky charm?\n\"My lucky charm is a year-old very weathered leather band around my wrist that says. \"Live in Love\"\nWho is your dream duet partner?\n\"Phillip Sweet from Little Big Town.

      "Transcript/Content": "Big Machine Gets Bigger\nBy Deborah Evans Price, 25 October 2006, Billboard\n\nTaylor Swift Is Ambitious Nashville Upstart Label’s Latest Success Story\n\nIn less than a year, Big Machine Records has made the leap from scrappy startup venture to successful record label with a No. 1 Jack Ingram single under its belt and teen newcomer Taylor Swift currently climbing the chart. \n\nThe Big Machine roster also includes Danielle Peck, Dusty Drake and former DreamWorks artist Jimmy Wayne, whose new single, \"That's All I'll Ever Need,\" is gaining momentum.\n\nCountry label vet Scott Borchetta opened the doors at Big Machine in September 2005 with a high-profile joint launch with Toby Keith's Show Dog Records. Both are distributed by Universal. Initially structured as sister labels, the companies shared marketing and radio promotion, but as each expanded, they decided to separate (Billboard, March 11).\n\n\"The only way we could address our priorities was for us to have our own promotions department,\" Borchetta says. \"Toby is really a brilliant business guy, and he understands that. We're great friends, and we've got two separate labels, but it was fun to start everything with him.\"\n\nBorchetta is proud that exactly eight months and eight days after Big Machine launched, the label was enjoying its first No. 1 with the Ingram hit \"Wherever You Are.\" \"It was a big day,\" he says proudly. \"It was one of those things where we were literally working seven days a week -- and we still pretty much are -- but that was a pretty darn cool moment when we rang the bell.\"\n\nBorchetta is president of Big Machine. He started his career in 1985 with a three-year stint at Mary Tyler Moore's MTM Records, moved to MCA Records in 1991 and in 1997 left to launch DreamWorks Nashville with James Stroud. DreamWorks merged into Universal Music Group in 2004, and Borchetta stayed with Universal until leaving to launch Big Machine last year.\n\nAndrew Kautz is Big Machine's GM, Jack Purcell heads the promotion department, and Penny Lazo is head of sales and marketing. Cynthia Grimson handles public relations. Other key staffers include Borchetta's wife, creative director Sandi Spika Borchetta, and director of national promotion John Zarling.\nThe label opened its doors Sept. 1, 2005, and by Sept. 26 was going for airplay on Peck's single \"I Don't.\" \"We didn't waste any time. We literally started with that song on day one. We went for airplay on the 26th and then we went for airplay on Ingram on the 31st of October. Jack's first album came out Jan. 9,\" Borchetta says, recapping the label's first efforts.\n\n\"I did not want to sit on our butts and wait for six months for the first record to come out,\" he says. \"I've seen so many startups, and after six or eight months, you're staffed up and you're just burning away money and literally nobody is working anything. They are just waiting on A&R to get up to speed. I just refused to launch the label like that, because I think it instills a certain amount of laziness upfront, and I wanted everybody here to bring brand-new running shoes ready to run on the first day.\"\n\nBorchetta's criteria for signing an act is simple. \"I either fall in love with an artist's music or I don't.\"\n\nThese days Big Machine's priority is the debut album by 16-year-old Swift, which streets Oct. 24. Swift is climbing the chart with \"Tim McGraw,\" which is No. 17 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart and has sold nearly 90,000 digital downloads. When he heard her perform, Borchetta says he just had to have her on the label, but admits he knew it wouldn't be easy because country programmers are hesitant to play teenagers.\n\n\"That's probably one of the things I love about it,\" he says. \"She's one of the best songwriters in Nashville period, and we were able to get people to see that and the fact that she plays guitar and the fact that she does sing that good, and she does write that good. She's witty and charming and all the things that a superstar artist should be.\"\n\nSwift grew up near Reading, Pa., but now lives near Nashville. \"I've been trying to do this since I was 10,\" she says. \"So many people tell me that radio won't play me because I'm too young. Because of that, radio is the biggest priority for me and building those relationships.\"\n\nSwift chose Big Machine because of the creative freedom Borchetta offered. \"I needed a company that would let me be myself and would let me write my own music,\" says Swift, who signed a publishing deal with Sony at 14.\n\n\"Scott Borchetta has not only encouraged me, but has insisted that I write my own music, and it's been really, really great, and I'm just so glad that I'm here,\" she says.\n\nSwift is slated to appear on \"Good Morning America\" on street date. Her debut has also gained exposure on GAC's \"Short Cuts.\"\n\n\"I've had the good fortune of breaking everybody from Trisha Yearwood all the way up to Sugarland with big stops in between,\" Borchetta says. \"This feels as big as any of them.\"\n\nIn general, Borchetta credits the experience and enthusiasm of his team for fueling Big Machine's success.\n\n\"I never told my staff that they were [an] independent,\" Borchetta says. \"I think that's part of it, that we didn't come out saying, 'We're a little indie'; that was never our point of view,\" Borchetta says about his staff of 13. \"It was just kind of blind belief that we were going to do this, and the advantage that we had is we've done this before. Jack Purcell has done this before. Cynthia Grimson has done this before. So it wasn't a person coming in from outside of our business just trying to figure the business out.\n\n\"We didn't expect to come out here and be kicked around like some little imprint,\" he continues. \"We came to play. Failure is really not an option, and I've got people around me that really understand the vision.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Young country; Taylor Swift brings the joy of genre to the teenage set\nBy Seamus Gallivan, 27 October 2006, Buffalo News.\n\nFor all that country music has been molded and marketed for the mainstream masses, the amount directed mainly toward the teenage set pales in comparison to other genres -- especially in the face of the current emo overload. With that void in mind, Taylor Swift appears poised for a major breakout.\n\nThe 16-year-old native of farm town Wyomissing, Pa., has scored a hit with the pining ballad \"Tim McGraw,\" the first of the 11 songs she wrote or co-wrote for her self-titled debut, released this week by Big Machine Records. While marked by maturity and broad enough lyrically for mass appeal, the album is built on Swift's youthful aplomb, and the two million-plus download count on her MySpace page proves that it serves her well.\n\nSwift is the newly crowned opening act for Rascal Flatts, which returns to HSBC Arena at 7:30 p.m. Thursday. Earlier this week, on the eve of the album's release and her first appearance on \"Good Morning America,\" she showed plenty of poise in discussing her arrival.\n\n>Your MySpace page is blowing up. How much time do you spend on MySpace yourself?\n\nI spend a lot of time on MySpace. Especially now, opening for Rascal Flatts, I'll get all the pictures from the meet-and-greet and the shows. It's a great way to keep in touch and connect in a way that's personal -- instead of having fans, I have friends, and that's really cool.\n\n>How much input did you have in the recording process of your album?\n\nI had so much input. That's the reason why I work so well with my producer, Nathan Chapman, because he listens. I'll sing him an intro lick for a song, and he listens and brings it to life. We tried 'A- list' producers and looked into a lot of people, but he's been working with me since I was 14. No one could make my music like him, and I'm so glad we were able to stick with him.\n\n>How have co-writing sessions helped you grow as a songwriter?\n\nI think I grow more from living life than through co-writing. Co- writing doesn't teach you anything as a songwriter, just how to get your ideas across better.\n\nI've grown a lot through high school. I spent a lot of time as an outsider, so I tend to write songs about things going on around me, through observations -- how people are thinking, feeling, reacting. I was writing songs about relationships when I was 13, but I wasn't in any relationships. I was writing about things I'd watched in movies or just watching how people communicate.\n\n>Is there any country music that speaks directly to you as a teenager?\n\nI think all country music speaks to me. People relate to emotions they've felt, and it can apply to anything. I think that an honest song is a good song, and honest music has no age demographic.",

      "Transcript/Content": "On The Verge: Taylor Swift: Teen hops on back of 'Tim McGraw'\nBy Brian Mansfield, 21 November 2006, USA Today.\n\nWhen you think Tim McGraw: In her breakout single, Tim McGraw, Taylor Swift hopes a summer fling remembers her every time he hears the country superstar on the radio. Swift, who turns 17 Dec. 13, is also making that connection in the minds of country fans. Tim McGraw sits at No. 13 on the country singles chart, and Swift's self- titled album has sold more than 60,000 copies in the month since its release. A bonus: The song probably has fused Swift and McGraw forever in the mind of the old boyfriend who inspired the song. \"He bought the album and said he really loved it, which is sweet,\" Swift says. \"His current girlfriend isn't too pleased with it, though.\"\n\nEverything adds up: Swift started writing Tim McGraw in her freshman math class. \"I played it for my record company president,\" Swift says. \"He looked at me and was like, 'Well, that's your first single.' I was like, 'OK, I guess that's how that works, then.'\" Swift says she aced math that semester.\n\nReading, writing and Rascal Flatts: Swift originally hails from Reading, Pa. Her father, a stockbroker with Merrill Lynch, moved the family to the Nashville area when Swift was 13. She got a publishing deal at 14 and a record deal at 15. Her album, which came out Oct. 23, opened in the top 20. She toured with Rascal Flatts this fall and has landed the opening slot on George Strait's 2007 tour.\n\nSam, you know who I am: Swift put coded messages into the lyrics in her CD's jacket, including the name of the boy who inspired the cheating song Should've Said No. She got the idea from stories she had heard about The Beatles. \"They used to play around with secret messages in their records,\" she says. \"I figured you can't play a CD backward, but with encoding stuff into the lyrics, I was able to get a similar kind of thing across.\"\n\nManipulating the charts: She has sold more than 100,000 downloads of the single, and of those, three were Swift's own well-timed purchases. \"I wanted it so badly to get into the top 10 at iTunes,\" she says. \"So when it was sitting at 11, I downloaded it. And it went into the top 10. Then I really wanted it to be top 5, so I downloaded it again when it was sitting at 6. Then I really wanted it to be No. 1 when my album came out, so I downloaded it again, and then it went No. 1.\"\n\nWaiting to meet McGraw: Swift has yet to meet the man who gave her song its name: \"I've heard from people that he and Faith [Hill] love the song, which was awesome to hear.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "When She Thinks “Tim McGraw,” Taylor Swift Savors Payoff\nHardworking Teen to Open for George Strait Next Year\n\nby Edward Morris 12/1/2006\n\nIt takes about 30 seconds of conversing with Taylor Swift to realize that this excited teenager is also a savvy, no-nonsense careerist. Here is a lady who knows exactly what she wants and is bullet straight in going for it.\n\nSwift, who will turn 17 on Dec. 13, is still riding high on her first single, “Tim McGraw.” It is easily the most sensuous and catchy coming-of-age song since “Strawberry Wine,” and her accompanying music video shows these adolescent emotions coming to a boil.\n\n“I wrote [the song] in my freshman year of high school,” Swift explains. “I got the idea in math class. I was just sitting there, and I started humming this melody. I kind of related it to this situation I was in. I was dating a guy who was about to go off to college. I knew we were going to break up. So I started thinking about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. Surprisingly, the first thing that came to mind was that my favorite country artist is Tim McGraw.”\n\nA native of Wyomissing, Pa., near Reading, Swift has been obsessed with performing since she was 10.\n\n“Every single weekend, I would go to festivals and fairs and karaoke contests — any place I could get up on stage,” she recalls. “The cool thing about this is that my parents have never pushed me. It’s always been [my] desire and love to do this. That’s what makes this so sweet. … If I had been pushed, if I didn’t love this, I would probably not have been able to get this far.”\n\nOne of Swift’s early mentors was country singer and bar owner Pat Garrett, who scored several minor hits in the 1980s.\n\n“I started out singing karaoke in his roadhouse — his little bar — when I was 10 years old,” she says. “He’ll vouch that I was in there every single week saying, ‘I’m just going to come back if you don’t let me win one.’ I was kind of like an annoying fly around that place. I just would not leave them alone. What they would do is have these karaoke contests. And if you won, you got to open for, like, Charlie Daniels or George Jones. I would go until I would win.”\n\nSwift made her first foray into Nashville when she was 11, but nothing came of it. Two years later, however, her family bowed to her ambition and moved to Music City. Even at 13, her talent was striking. It earned her attention from several major labels and, ultimately, a development deal from RCA Records. That deal, although it never yielded her a record, did give her the muscle to secure a publishing contract with mammoth Sony/ATV Music when she was only 14.\n\nAlthough Swift denies having any malice toward the labels that overlooked or neglected her, a glimmer of resentment still shines through.\n\n“I can understand,” she says. “They were afraid to put out a 13-year-old. They were afraid to put out a 14-year-old. Then they were afraid to put out a 15-year-old. Then they were nervous about putting out a 16-year-old. And I’m sure if I hadn’t signed with Scott Borchetta [head of Big Machine Records], everybody would be afraid to put out a 17-year-old.”\n\nBorchetta signed Swift in 2005, and she recorded her album during a four-month period just before the year ended. Big Machine released “Tim McGraw” in June and her self-titled album in late October. Swift wrote three of the album’s 11 songs on her own and co-wrote the rest.\n\nNot surprisingly, the songs are about young love and angst.\n\n“You listen to my album,” Swift says, “and it sounds like I’ve had 500 boyfriends. But that’s really not the case. I found that you don’t have to date someone to write a song about them.”\n\nTake, for example, “The Outside,” a song she penned when she was 12.\n\n“I was going through a really tough time in school and facing a lot of rejection among my peers,” she explains. “I found that I was alone a lot of the time, kind of on the outside looking into their discussions and the things they were saying to each other. They really didn’t talk to me. In the process of coming to that realization, I started developing this really keen sense of observation — of how to watch people and see what they did. From that sense, I was able to write songs about relationships when I was 13 but not in relationships.”\n\nThen there’s “Should’ve Said No,” which she wrote just a week before her final recording session. “Basically, it’s about a guy who cheated on me and shouldn’t have because I write songs,” she zings. Indeed, some of her songs cite the names of actual or might-have-been boyfriends, while others spell them out in code. (To “crack” the code, Swift explains helpfully, one simply has to jot down the capital letters in the order they appear in the lyrics printed in the liner notes.)\n\n“We switched [album] producers a bunch of times,” Swift says. “I started off with this demo producer who worked in a little shed behind this publishing company I was at. His name was Nathan Chapman. I’d always go in there and play him some new songs, and the next week he would have this awesome track, on which he played every instrument, and it sounded like a record. We did this for a period of a year to two years before I got my record deal.\n\n“Then, all of a sudden, it was, ‘OK, we’re going to use this producer’ or ‘We’re going to use that producer.’ So I got to record with a bunch of really awesome producers in Nashville. But it didn’t sound the way that it did with Nathan. He had never made an album before. He had just recorded demos. But the right chemistry hit. Finally my record label president said, ‘OK, try some sides with Nathan.’” In the end, Chapman produced all but one of the cuts.\n\nSwift spent much of this year doing a radio tour to promote “Tim McGraw” specifically and the album generally. “Radio tours for most artists last six weeks,” she observes. “Mine lasted six months. That’s because I wanted it to. I wanted to meet every single one of the people that was helping me out.”\n\nThe whirlwind life hasn’t hurt Swift academically. Last year, she had a perfect 4.0 grade point average. Now a junior, she’s being home-schooled, although she admits she’s seldom home. She hopes to accelerate her studies and graduate early.\n\nAs she was nearing the end of her radio tour, Swift got a call from Rascal Flatts, asking her to open nine shows for them. With only a two-day advance warning, she hit the road with the trio, initially backed only by a guitar player and a fiddler. Next year, she will open for George Strait.\n\n“I’m still in the ‘Oh-my-gosh-this-is-really-happening’ phase,” Swift confesses. “After all these concerts that I do, people line up and want me to sign things. I still haven’t been able to grasp the fact that if I sign a piece of paper, it might mean something to somebody.”\n\nOne thing Swift won’t have to worry about while she’s on the road is writing songs for her next album. “I’ve been very selfish about my songs,” she says. “I had this dream of this project coming out for so many years now that I just stockpiled. I’m so happy that I did because now we have a second album full of songs and a third album full of songs, and I don’t have to lift a finger.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] A Tale Swift Success\n\nWho in the world is Taylor Swift, how did she get a spot on tour with George Strait and Ronnie Milsap and what does Tim McGraw have to do with all this? {We've got answers.}\n\nBeing ten years old in 1997 meant you were probably doing one of two things with your early evenings: diving nose-deep into a brand new book series featuring an awkward young wizard named Harry Potter, or lamenting over the removal of Steve Urkel and the Winslows from the ABC Network's TGIF line- up. Ten-year-old Taylor Swift, however, was most likely doing neither. Actually, the future country starlet probably wasn't home at all. The dainty blonde was most likely working at the local bars, county fairs and festivals. (And the best part was her parents knew about it.) While her peers sat at home dreaming of becoming ballerinas and veterinarians-dreams that changed a hundred times in the next week-Taylor was starting at the ground level of a dream she was determined to fulfill.\n\nSEVEN YEARS and many karaoke nights later, Swift is celebrating the pinnacle of her teenage years by emerging as one of the future forces in country music. Her meadowlark voice is just a prelude to her talent as a writer and musician. During a time of country music when critics are quick to tag newcomers with one-hit-wonder status, these characteristics are anchoring Swift's confidence. Instead of getting ready for prom and packing for college, this blue-eyed blonde bombshell is graduating into a class of new Nashville talent performing way beyond its years.\nTaylor grew up quickly on the stages of karaoke bars and county fairs in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. In a town of less than 9,000 people, her talents had plenty of room to flourish and little competition to discourage. By the age of 11, Swift had already moved up from the local dives to perform the national anthem in front of thousands at a Philadelphia 76ers game. The little performer was ready to take her voice and curls to Nashville to push the envelope on her dream. It was time for a wake up call.\n\"When I was 11, I came to Nashville and quickly decided that I wanted to do this for the rest of my life,\" says Swift. \"At first, though, I walked up and down Music Row, strolled into each studio I came to and just said, 'Hey, I'm Taylor and I want a record label. Obviously that didn't work out.\"\nSwift quickly became aware of how many gorgeous young talents were knocking on Nashville's door at the same time. In a tribute to the young girls fortitude and maturity, she was prepared to step back and re-plan her attack. \"There are so many beautiful girls trying to make it in Nashville,just one more beautiful girl after another and each can sing louder and higher than the next. So, I decided that the way I could stand out was to pick up the guitar and start writing. If I couldn't stand out by doing everything to get to this point, I wouldn't be here.\"\nShe picked up her first guitar as soon as she got home. Swift wasn't around when Bryan Adam's released Summer of 69 in 1984, but that didn't stop her from playing for hours until her fingers bled. The hard-working twelve-year- old sat alone with her guitar, pen and note book until her mother called her for dinner, which always seemed too early. Her early teenage emotion poured out of her pen. She wrote song after song about heartache, insecurity and love; every song was pervad ed with her teenage touch, but accessible to every music lover. In the process of writing enough songs to fill two guitar cases, Swift and her family made frequent trips to Nashville in order for Taylor to display her talents in search of recognition.\nThat recognition came for Taylor at age 15. While playing at Nashville's historical Bluebird Café-famous for showcasing tomorrow's country stars-long-time music promoter and marketer Scott Borchetta was immediately struck by Swift's sweet voice and powerful lyrics. It didn't take long for Borchetta to realize that that he couldn't let the opportunity to sign this 15-year-old talent to his brand-new record label, Big Machine Records, slip out of his hands. The new label and new star have since become a perfect fit. Under the umbrella of Nashville giant Universal Music Group, Big Machine Records is currently launching the careers of future headliners such as Jack Ingram, Danielle Peck and, of course, Taylor Swift.\n\"The label started Sept 1, 2005,\" Swift says, \"and it is just really exciting to see what things have happened since then. Jack Ingram's number one record and then my success have got us off to a great start.\"\n\nBorchetta soon got Swift into the recording studio so that he could introduce her to the world. Her initial, unsurprising success is a product of her first album, Taylor Swift, released in the fall of 2006, and her hit ballad about young love, Tim McGraw. With the bank of songs Swift had at her disposal, creating a smash album was less than grinding to say the least. \"Putting the album. together was easy, 'cause I've been recording every week since I was 13,\" says Swift. \"Picking songs was a little tough, but that was because there were so many to choose from. Overall, though, making the album wasn't the difficult part.\"\nThe real challenge came when the album was finished and Swift was hit with the biggest fear that comes with any artist's first album: sell or go home. \"Putting the album together was easy, but putting out an album was really tough,\" Swift admits. \"The first week we released, I was in New York and I was totally frantic. Hoping I would do well, I was really stressing out. I was so worried that I would completely flop. Because, no matter how much radio you get, it doesn't really matter compared to whether you sell albums or not. It is such a stressful thing.\"\nIt turns out that Taylor didn't have much to stress over. Taylor Swift sold over 40,000 copies in its first week of release and since has reached Gold Status, more than 300,000 copies. The sudden stardom she's achieved through impressive record sales and a hectic exposure schedule such as CMT spots and national anthem cameos-has added a big twist in her schedule as a high-school student. To Swift's credit though, she has chosen to finish her education through home-schooling when it would be much easier to let her tun- nel vision for success be limiting in focusing on her career.\n\"Having school while working at my music career has its ups and downs,\" Swift explains. \"I just feel like I'm learning so much in music with traveling and meeting people right now, and it's hard to apply what I'm learning with home-schooling right at this moment. But, on the other hand, learning stuff like history can keep me in with an intelligent conversation. I'd love people to look back after talking to me and think I was a genuinely smart person.\"\nTaylor will have to pack her books for the road, as CITYVIEW caught her while packing to leave the next day for a tour with the King of Country Music, George Strait. The tour, which began January 11, will go through early March and showcase Strait, Swift and country legend Ronnie Milsap. Swift expressed a great deal of excitement as she, the new Princess of Country Music, joins the King on the road. \"He's just unbelievable,\" says Swift. \"I've listened to him since I was little and I've never known a world without George Strait.\"\nHer humility does not mean that she isn't ready for the road, however. Swift has her tour planned to the \"T\" to make sure the experience is a success. \"Earlier in my career I toured with Rascal Flatts and was a last-minute addition. I literally had one day to pack and get ready to leave. With this tour, I've known for weeks and have been able to plan out everything from what I'm to pack, to what I'm going to eat, to how I'm going to spend each day.\" No matter what Swift has planned for herself, her career will no doubt advance due to the imminent success of what promises to be one of the highest-grossing tours of 2007. It is a move that will surely get her fans begging for a new album. Swift looks to bask in her monumental opportunity, but is keeping the recording studio on her mind.\n\"With all the songs I've written, 1 could go put out two albums right now,\" boasts Swift. \"Right now, though, I'm just going to enjoy this ride with the tour. But, I can see us getting back in the studio in March to start building tracks.\" While the majority of teenagers her age begin to make unsure decisions concerning their futures, Taylor Swift remains as unwavering in her life's ambition as the curly- haired ten year-old who started in the karaoke bars of Wyomissing. Instead of spending her time reveling in a time of teenage irresponsi bility, Swift refuses to sacrifice the last seven years of determination. \"I've never been a partier,\" says Swift. \"It scares me because I don't want to risk all that I've worked for by making a mistake or getting into a bad situation. I've worked too hard to throw it away like that.\"\n\"I really have assessed my life and my options, and I don't see myself being anything but a singer and a songwriter. Music is my life and that won't ever change.\"\n\nA Day on Tour with Taylor\nBeing a young woman and facing the stressful daily obstacles of life is hard enough, but when you add on the vigorous schedule of a nationwide tour, it becomes down-right insane. When touring with two kings of country music, there's never a dull moment, and not much time to relax! We're happy to get you inside Taylor's schedule book to see what an average day for her on tour feels like, Just remember, young up-and-coming music superstars, this is the schedule you'll have to look forward to, so get plenty of sleep while you can!\n\n1:30 am In bed after final concert meet & greet\n6:30 am Wake up to do radio phone interviews in my bus bunk, then back to sleep\n10:00 am Wake up and work out with friend and fiddle player, Emily, \"We're determined to get in shape\"-Taylor\n12:00 pm Out and about to check out whatever town the tour is in\n1:00 pm Off to the radio stations to do promo and interviews\n5:00 pm Sound check with George Strait and Ronnie Milsap\n6:45 pm Media meet & greet\n7:30 pm Show starts and I go on\n8:15 pm Show's end-l go sign after my, Ronnie and George's performances\n1:30 am Starts all over again!

      "Transcript/Content": "Country newcomer seems ready for the big-time: Taylor Swift opens for two musical legends\nBy Charity Apple, 18 January 2007, McClatchy-Tribune Business News.\n\nJan. 18--GREENSBORO -- Taylor Swift sounded like any other 17-year-old girl, giddy about a wearing a gorgeous gown.\n\n\"I can't wait for you to see it,\" Swift said in a phone interview from her home in Hendersonville, Tenn., on Tuesday afternoon. \"It is going to be so cool.\" Swift was talking about the 21-foot-long bluish-green chiffon gown she wears in her latest video, \"Teardrops On My Guitar.\" It is the second single from her self-titled album on Big Machine Records. The video shoot was Monday night. \"It is such a fantasy dress. One that girls like us would love,\" Swift added, still sounding bubbly.\n\nBut there's another side to this gorgeous curly-haired blonde. She's tough.\n\nShe's determined.\n\n\"I never expected to be given anything in this business. I wanted to work for everything I've gotten, and I have.\" Those qualities, along with her amazing talent, have land ed her a place among other up-and-coming country music artists. Swift is currently the opening act for country music's heavy hitters, George Strait and Ronnie Milsap. The three will perform at the Greensboro Coliseum at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. Tickets are still available.\n\nHer self-titled album has sold more than 300,000 copies, and it was just announced last week that she would be part of the Brad Paisley's 2007 Hershey's Presents Bonfires & Amplifiers Tour, a tour including Jack Ingram and Kellie Pickler, of \"American Idol\" fame.\n\n\"I really do feel blessed. It's just unbelievable that here I no surprise when she started singing at age 10. A year later, she sang the national anthem in front of thousands of fans during a Philadelphia 76ers NBA game. Swift began play ing guitar and writing her own songs at age 12.\n\n\"When we visited Nashville, I saw all these beautiful girls living in apartments ... they could all sing higher and hold notes longer than I could. I immediately thought 'what can I do to make myself stand out?' Playing guitar and writ ing my own songs seemed like the natural choice.\" Her parents saw their daughter's hard work and determination and decided to make the move to nearby Hendersonville. A perform ance at the Bluebird Cafe caught record producer Scott Borchetta's eye. Borchetta signed Swift to the Big Machine Records label.\n\nSwift recently celebrated her 17th birthday. In between studying (she's a straight-A student), gigs, video shoots and various radio, newspaper am, sharing the stage with two legends. Ronnie Milsap and George Strait have something like 100 No. 1 hits. To be added to their tour is such a huge thing,\" she said.\n\nThen again, Swift will tell you that she's worked for this. She grew up on a farm in Wyomissing, Pa. Her maternal grandmother was a professional opera singer, so it was and television interviews, she doesn't have much time to hang out with her friends. But she does have opportunities that most teenage girls don't.\n\nOn Monday night, she invited some of her cousins, friends and even her younger brother to be part of the video shoot.\n\n\"It was really cool,\" she said. But her brother didn't agree. \"I asked my brother if he liked it and he said it was the dumbest thing he'd ever done,\" Swift laughed. \"So I guess he won't be pursuing a career in country music.\" That aside, Taylor Swift is enjoying this whole experience. She wants to be noticed when she walks into her area Wal-Mart. And it's not a bother to talk to fans or sign autographs.\n\n\"I've wanted this life since I was a little girl,\" she said. \"I've been that girl in the meet-andgreet line. I've been that girl at a country concert, wishing that was me on stage. I'm still such a fan, too. When Ronnie Milsap told me that he's listened to my entire album, I was shocked. I'm having such a great time.\" ",

      "Transcript/Content": "Country artist Taylor Swift is touring with George Strait and will tour next with Brad Paisley. The self-confident teenager talked her parents into moving to Nashville 'because that was where I needed to be.'\nBy Janis Fontaine, 27 January 2007, The Palm Beach Post.\n\nTaylor Swift, who plays the KISS 99.9 Chili Cookoff in Pembroke Pines Sunday, has passed a couple of important milestones recently: She turned 17 (\"just another syllable\"), and her first album has gone gold (\"time for a party!\"), racking up sales of more than a half-million since its release in October. Her debut single, Tim McGraw, is No. 6 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart, and the video hit No. 1.\n\nSo, you're home-schooled?\n\nYes, it just got too busy, I couldn't go to school anymore. I set aside some time every day when I'm going to do my home schoolwork. I've got to stay motivated because I want to get it over with.\n\nWhat about college?\n\nI can see myself later on down the road taking some classes. College seems to me that you're learning how to live on your own, learning how the real world operates, and I've been learning that since I was 14.\n\nDo your parents travel with you?\n\nMy mom travels with me, but my dad is out on the road with me this week, which is odd, because he never comes on the road, but yeah, I usually have a parent with me.\n\nHave the adults around you tried to change you?\n\nI haven't had any adults try to change me. My parents have raised me really well, and the morals they've instilled in me, I really look up to them. When you're growing up, you don't really realize it, but I see how my friends have been treated and how they're growing up.\n\nMy parents empowered me from day one. Literally, if I wanted to be something, they honestly believed that I could be. I think there's a difference between telling your kid \"you can do whatever you want\" and actually believing it.\n\nFor about three years in Pennsylvania, I was singing in bars and karaoke contests every single weekend, and at 13, I convinced my parents to move to Nashville because I knew that was where I needed to be to make a go of it.\n\nWhy does your music appeal to adults when you're just 17?\n\nI think the reason for that is me being a fan of music; I've never ever been a fan of anyone who I didn't believe what they were saying. If I didn't buy it, if I didn't believe it, then I'm not going to listen to it.\n\nBut I'm the first one to stand up and say, \"I'm 17, I've never had a kid, I've never been married, I don't think I've ever been in love, but you know what, I'm going to sing about the stuff I do know.\"\n\nWas it hard to get people to take you seriously at 14?\n\nIf it was, I didn't pay attention to it. I think if you take yourself seriously, other people will, too. And if you have confidence, but not cockiness, then they'll believe in you a little bit.\n\nMy publisher was really good, and he'd say, just give her a chance, and I'd come in with about 10 song ideas every single time, and I kind of set out to prove to these people that I could do it.\n\nHow do you handle rejection or bad reviews?\n\nI think it's self-destructive to dwell on things that don't go well because there's so many things that do. In my case, I can look at all the other things that are going well.\n\nI've never gotten a horrible review, but if anybody's taken any jabs, the jabs usually are taken at my age. And for me, it's like, you know what? If that's all you've got for me, then I'm all right. \n\nSo you toured a lot at the end of 2006. What's 2007 looking like?\n\nI've been on the road pretty much for 10 months straight, and my voice has been holding up pretty well. I haven't gotten sick at all. I'm out with George Strait now, and I toured with Rascal Flatts earlier this year. In the spring and summer, it's Brad Paisley. And then - this is on the DL - I'm touring with Tim McGraw after that.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Face to face with stardom\nBy Cathalena E. Burch, 1 February 2007, Arizona Daily Star.\n\nTaylor Swift excited to be opening for the legendary George Strait\n\nThe buzz was just starting to swirl around country music newcomer Taylor Swift when super trio Rascal Flatts tapped her for her first tour last fall.\nA few months later, her debut album still hot from pressing, she got a phone call to join George Strait's winter tour, which pulls into Phoenix Friday.\nThis spring, she and her bus join the convoy with Brad Paisley, and this summer, she'll head out for 10 dates on the Faith and Tim - as in Hill and McGraw - Soul II Soul 2 tour.\n\nHow will the 17-year-old top that?\n\"I have no idea. Kenny Chesney and Keith Urban, I guess,\" Swift joked during a phone interview last week.\n\nSwift can thank her self-penned coming-of-age song \"Tim McGraw\" for her out-of-the-box success. The song went to No. 5 on Billboard's charts and pushed sales of her Big Machine Records debut, \"Taylor Swift,\" to gold (500,000 sales) in three months.\nSwift's quick rise is three-parts chutzpah, one part determination, and a legacy of parents believing so strongly in their little girl's talents that they packed up and moved to give her a shot.\nSwift was 11 when the family uprooted from Redding, Pa., to Music City. Armed with a recording of Swift performing karaoke, they marched into every major label on Music Row.\nOf course, they laughed her back to the curb.\n\"I think I realized I had to be different,\" Swift said. \"There are thousands of girls on Music Row who . . . want this just as much as I do.\"\nSo the girl with wavy blond locks picked up a 12-string guitar, learned to play and began writing songs.\n\"If I can walk into a room and play guitar for myself and sing songs I'd written, I wouldn't have to depend on anyone creatively,\" she reasoned.\n\nAt 13, she snatched a publishing deal, which led to her Big Machine record deal. She was 16 when her debut was released.\n\nSwift wrote all 11 songs on the album, songs rich in stories about teen love and longing, the lure of independence, the mystery of what lies ahead. There's a streak of sass running through the break-up song \"Picture To Burn\" - \"So watch me strike a match / On all my wasted time / As far as I'm concerned / You're just another picture to burn\" - and the memorable hook \"When you think Tim McGraw / I hope you think of me\" from the song that set this ball in motion.\n\nSwift has yet to meet McGraw, but she spoke with him on the phone during a live radio show. He told her the song made him feel old but that he was proud of her.\n\nIn the weeks she's been out with Strait, she's met him once. From the schoolgirl giddiness in her voice, you could tell she was starstruck.\n\n\"He goes, 'It's really great to have you on tour. Everybody just loves you.' That was it. I was like, 'Oh my God. That was George,' \" she said, then laughed.\n\nFriday will be her second Arizona performance. She sang the National Anthem at the Phoenix NASCAR race last fall. About 180,000 folks watched from the stands and millions were watching on TV.\n\nSo where would she like to take this? Everywhere, she says with confidence. She would love to see her debut go platinum (1 million in sales), hopes to move up to second opening act and, with luck and a little more of that chutzpah, land a headlining tour in a year or two.\n\n\"If you believe this is where you belong, then other people will, too,\" she said.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Berks Native, 17, shakes up country with 'Tim McGraw'\nBy Keith Groller, 3 February 2007, The Morning Call, Allentown, Pa. \n\nFeb. 3--It's hard to believe now, but when she was growing up on a farm in Wyomissing, Berks County, 17-year-old Taylor Swift, one of country music's most in-demand rising stars, lived in relative isolation.\n\n\"I went through some tough times,\" she says. \"I didn't really have a lot of friends. I didn't have a lot of people to talk to, so I had to find an escape to fill that void, and, for me, it was music.\"\n\nSwift needn't worry about a lack of friends these days, especially since her song \"Tim McGraw\" hit No. 6 on Billboard magazine's country charts and her self-titled debut CD reached as high as No. 3 on various country lists.\n\nCountry star Toby Keith and veteran label executive Scott Borchetta made her one of the first signings to their new Big Machine Records label. Rascal Flatts and George Strait have tapped her as an opening act, and later this year she will hit the road with Brad Paisley.\n\nSo even though 2006 was a breakthrough year for the teenager with long-flowing, curly blond hair and cover-girl looks, she is more excited about 2007.\n\n\"Last year was unbelievable, because I saw the results of all of my hard work begin to materialize,\" says Swift, who on Thursday night will make a rare solo appearance at Allentown's Crocodile Rock Cafe. \"But now that 2007 has rolled around, I've got a Top 5 song and the No. 1 music video on CMT and more exciting things are about to happen.\"\n\nSwift may be a favorite to collect some best new artist trophies at awards shows this year, but she shuns the \"overnight success\" label. While it's natural to compare her to other young stars of the past such as LeAnn Rimes, her first idol in country music, and Tanya Tucker, Swift is hardly naive or unprepared. When you talk to her, her poise and certainty makes it easy to forget that she should only be a high-school junior. She sounds much more like a polished veteran.\n\n\"You're doing interviews all of the time and I like talking to people,\" says Swift. \"You learn how to be on the radio and express your thoughts. If you're not comfortable, it's a problem.\"\n\nAs a youngster, Swift learned about country music by listening to Dolly Parton and Patsy Cline. Her desire to sing and perform led her to join a children's theater group in Wyomissing, and while playing Sandy in \"Grease,\" she noticed something about her singing style -- it was country, and it came naturally.\n\n\"I always think back to the time before this success happened and I'm 10 years old and nobody knows who you are, and you're just going to festivals, fairs and karaoke contests,\" she says. \"You remember that it really took a long time to make this happen.\"\n\nTaylor made her first trip to Nashville looking for a record deal when she was 11, walking up and down Music Row with her mom, handing out a demo tape of her singing along to karaoke songs. Not surprisingly, she didn't get a deal, but after returning home, she picked up a guitar and wrote her first song, \"Lucky You.\"\n\nThe next time Swift returned to Nashville, she was 14. She arrived with a demo of songs she had written and a resume that included an Abercrombie & Fitch ad campaign. Sony ATV publishing signed her to a songwriting deal, and eventually she came to Borchetta's attention.\n\nBorchetta, who helped orchestrate Keith's rise to stardom, saw her perform at the Bluebird Cafe, and inked her to Big Machine soon after.\n\nThe \"McGraw\" single took off in part because the title featured the name of another artist. But once country fans give it a listen, they discovered it was really not about Faith Hill's husband and that it was actually a likeable tune with catchy lyrics.\n\nSwift starred in the song's video, which was filmed at Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash's cabin. \"That was unbelievable to be doing our makeup in Johnny Cash's old recording studio,\" Swift says.\n\nSwift wrote all of the songs on her debut, but says those 11 represent just the ones she liked the most out of the nearly 250 she has written. \"I realized when I got to Nashville that there were a lot of young girl singers,\" she says. \"I figured that I needed a way to stand out, so I got out my 12-string guitar and started to play my own songs. By writing my own songs, I figured I wouldn't need to depend on other songwriters.\"\n\nIf \"McGraw\" is any indication, Swift can rely on her own instincts when it comes to delivering a hit. \"The song is about what's so beautiful about music and what's so dangerous about music,\" Swift says. \"As you go through life, you'll never forget certain moments, both good and bad, and what song was playing in the background at that particular time. It could have been that first date in high school, the special song when you fell in love or when you got married. ... Music defines so many moments in life and when you hear them, they take you back to that time or that person. That's really what this song is all about.\"\n\nSwift's music delves heavily into the intricacies of romantic relationships, but she insists she's not in one at the moment. \"I'm really into being independent,\" she says. \"If you listen to my songs, you'd think I've been in relationships with 500 boyfriends, but I really haven't. Right now, I can't think about anything else but my career. With my schedule and everything that's going on, I'm just too busy for a relationship right now.\"\n\nBut Swift would like to build relationships with her fans. She is looking forward to the solo gig, which will give her an opportunity to go well beyond the 30-minute set she normally uses to open for Strait or Rascal Flatts. And she is happy to return to Pennsylvania, where she once played venues like the Bloomsburg Fair and Pat Garrett's Roadhouse as a complete unknown.\n\nPennsylvania is better known for producing football players than country stars, and while she is entrenched in the Nashville area -- she lives in Hendersonville, 20 minutes north of Music City -- she wouldn't mind a return visit to Berks County.\n\n\"If Wyomissing ever wants to put up a sign that says 'Wyomissing, Hometown of Country Star Taylor Swift,' that would be just great with me,\" she laughs.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift delights WCU fans at Asplundh\n\nByOnline Editor\n Feb 12, 2007\nLast Friday night, not even the bitter cold stopped any Taylor Swift fan from packing into the Emilie K. Asplundh Concert Hall and she, without a doubt, made it all worth it. The concert, which was previously scheduled for Nov. 3 and then, Feb. 2, finally happened Friday night at 8 p.m. Starting off the night with opener and up-and-coming artist, Sydd, who sang acoustic renditions of John Mayer’s, “Why Georgia,” and Weezer’s, “Beverly Hills,” along with his own original songs, riled up the crowd as he kept repeating that Taylor Swift would soon be coming onstage.\n\nAt just 17-years-old, Taylor Swift, whose first self-titled debut album just went gold in January and who has just been nominated for two CMT awards for, “Top Female Artist” and “Top Breakout Artist,” proved Friday at West Chester University that the fame and success has not gone to her head.\n\nIn an interview before the show, she said that she, like any other aspiring artist, was uncertain if this success would ever happen.\n\n“When I was putting out a single, you never know how it’s going to go. You don’t know because it all depends on how that first single does and that’s your first shot. That’s your one shot, and if that thing tanks, your chances of making it decrease greatly. My parents raised me to always have really high hopes but low expectations and never expect that something is going to be given to me, so I always worked harder for it,” Swift said.\n\nIt had clear that her hard work indeed paid off as the crowd roared when she appeared on stage, surprisingly singing Eminem’s, “Lose Yourself,” which talks about that, “one shot,” at making it in life. The crowd was pleased as they quickly abandoned their seats and moved to the front to gather around the stage to be closer to Swift.\n\nThe concert moved along as she sang songs from her first album including her latest single, “Teardrops on my Guitar,” which is about a boy who always talked about how perfect his girlfriend was, all the while missing that Taylor was in love with him as well.\n\nShe said before the show that she wrote every song on her album and that she gets her inspirations from her own personal experiences of love and relationships. Her top five hit single, “Tim McGraw,” was written long before she knew it would be her first single.\n\n“‘Tim McGraw’ is about this guy that I was dating who was about to go off to college, and I knew we were going to break up, so I started thinking about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. One of the first things that came to my mind was, well, my favorite song is a Tim McGraw song,” she said.\n\nThe most significant part of the show and Swift’s visit to WCU was her determination to please her fans. She announced during the show that she would stay after the concert until every one of her fans has met her, promising to sign anything they wanted and promising to take a picture with them.\n\nShe said, “If I want to sell 500,000 albums, I want to meet that many people. We’re there sometimes for like five hours after shows but I don’t care because as long as I get to meet those people, I know that they’ll be faithful to me and my music.”\n\nThe crowd’s reaction to her devotion to them was immediate, especially after she stated that this show was somewhat of a “hometown concert,” since she is originally from Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. She also stated that like many WCU students, she spent many summers at the Jersey shore. She and her family moved to Nashville, Tenn., after recognizing her amazing talent.\n\nSwift continued to please the WCU crowd as she brought three little girls on stage for her song, “Stay Beautiful.” The concert hall was ecstatic with her performance and one could even hear the male fans in the crowd declaring their love for her.\n\nYou can vote for Taylor Swift for her two nominations for the CMT Music Awards by going to www.CMT.com. She will also be performing Feb. 13, 2007 on the “Tonight Show with Jay Leno.”\n\nThe interview that took place before Friday’s show will soon be a part of West Chester University’s PodCast Central that you can listen to by going to the WCU Web site, www.wcupa.edu. The interview will also soon be posted on her Official MySpace page.\n\nTaylor Swift left her mark here at West Chester University and she left advice for the student body saying, “Stay positive. Everybody has bad days. Whether you’re a singer, or you’re going for a career in medicine, you’re going to have horrible, horrible days, but just know that it always gets better. It always does.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Interview: She Discusses Her Debut Album, Taylor Swift, Her Hit “Tim McGraw”,  And How She Got Started\nFebruary 16, 2007\n\nBy Dale Kawashima\n\nSinger & songwriter Taylor Swift may only be 17, but she has quickly established herself as one of country music’s brightest, young stars. Propelled by the success of her breakthrough single ‘Tim McGraw,’ Swift’s debut album Taylor Swift (on Big Machine Records) has already been certified gold just three months after its October 2006 release. In addition, music industry pros and fans alike are learning that Swift is not just an attractive young singer, but a skilled songwriter who wrote or co-wrote all the songs on this Taylor Swift first album.\n\nIn a new interview, Swift talked about the rapid success of her debut album, and how she has made the transition from being an unknown artist to rising country star. Swift discussed how she focused on her songwriting early on, how she signed a publishing deal with Sony/ATV Music at age 14, and that she has written over 200 songs. Also, Swift recalled what inspired her to write her unique hit, ‘Tim McGraw.’ And lastly, when asked, she gives advice to young artists who are trying to break into the music business.\n\nSwift grew up in Wyomissing, PA, where she learned to sing at an early age. In particular, she was influenced by her maternal grandmother, who was a professional opera singer. By age 10, Swift began performing at local karaoke contests, festivals and county fairs, and she recorded some rough demos. At age 11, she sang the national anthem at a Philadelphia 76ers NBA game.\n\nWhen she was 12, Swift learned to play guitar and started developing her songwriting. She would take trips to Nashville with her family, where she would play her demos for music pros, and collaborate with local songwriters. When she was 13, she signed an artist development deal with RCA Records, which led to her meeting her main songwriting partner, Liz Rose (they wrote ‘Tim McGraw’ together). And then it was a year later, that she got her big break as a songwriter.\n\n‘I signed my publishing deal at age 14 with Sony/ATV,’ explained Swift. ‘I signed and worked with (exec) Arthur Buenahora, who was great. (Buenahora is now an A&R exec at Capitol Nashville Records). ‘When I signed, I knew that I had to work just as hard as the veteran 45-year-old writers who were also signed there. I wrote a lot of songs, which were mainly for my own artist project, rather than writing songs for pitching to other artists.’\n\nIt was about a year later that Swift caught the attention of music veteran Scott Borchetta (formerly of Dreamworks Records), who was preparing to launch his new label, Big Machine Records (distributed by Universal). She performed a showcase at the famed Nashville club, the Bluebird Café, and Borchetta was so impressed that he signed her to an artist deal with Big Machine\n\nFor her first album, Swift wrote three songs by herself, and she collaborated on seven songs with Liz Rose. ‘I love writing with Liz,’ she said. ‘When we write, I usually come in with a melody and some lyric content, and then we’ll work on creating the rest of the song. She’s a really good song editor.’\n\nOne of the songs they wrote early on was the hit ‘Tim McGraw.’ ‘The song is based on true events — it happened in real life,’ Swift explained. ‘I had a boyfriend and we had broken up. After the break-up, I wanted him to be reminded of me. The key lines in the song are: ‘When you think Tim McGraw/I hope you think my favorite song/The one we danced to all night long’. There was a specific Tim McGraw song which inspired me ‘ it was ‘Can’t Tell Me Nothin”, which was on his Live Like You Were Dying album.’\n\n‘Tim McGraw’ was eventually released as Swift’s first single, and it stayed on the Billboard country chart for an impressive 35 weeks. ‘When I originally wrote ‘Tim McGraw’ and first played it for the label, I didn’t think it would become a single,’ she said. ‘But the label said it was a single, and they were right.’\n\nNow that the song and her album is a major success, Swift has been further promoting her album by appearing on several TV shows, and by touring steadily. Currently, she is on tour as the opening act for superstar George Strait (‘the tour is going amazing,’ she said), and this spring she will be opening for Brad Paisley.\n\nWhile she’s on the road, Swift has found time to write many new songs. ‘I’ve written a lot of songs by myself lately, especially since I’ve been alone so much on the road,’ she said. ‘I do love writing on the road – I usually write at the concert venue. I’ll find a quiet place in some room at the venue, like the locker room.’\n\nLastly, when asked what advice she would give to young artists who are trying to break into the music business, Swift said: ‘When you are trying to shop for a label deal, never use the phrase ‘I sound just like [another famous artist]’. Don’t say that to the labels. They’ll say ‘Well, we already have those big-name artists [so we don’t need to sign you]’. For young artists, try to sound original, so you don’t sound like anyone else. If you write your own songs that’s good, but if it’s not your thing don’t force it. Not everyone’s able to do it. Also, it’s important to realize, that once you get signed and release your album, you’re competing on the charts with all the established artists. A year ago I would just be listening to Miranda Lambert’s album (as a fan) — now I’m competing with her and other artists on the charts.’",

      "Transcript/Content": "LIFE: Interview with Taylor \n\nBy thebelmontcritic\nPublished Feb. 23, 2007. 11698 views\n\nInsideVandy.com staff writer Matt Reynolds conducted a phone interview with country music star (and local Nashville resident) Taylor Swift on Feb. 21. Swift's debut self-titled album was released by Big Machine Recordson Oct. 24, 2006; read Reynold's reviewhere.\n\nMR: To someone who has never heard of you, how would you describe your music?\nTS: Well my music is honest. I'm a singer/songwriter and I've written every song on my album. I like to write about relationships-love or getting out of it and stuff like that.\n\nMR: How did you initially deal with the fame that came with your debut album?\nTS: It was pretty cool to see that the album came out and people actually bought it. I had so much support from radio. It was so cool to see how many people were latching onto what I was doing and really believed in me. For people to spend their hard earned money and support me - that's really something that I appreciate.\n\nMR: You constantly read other publications hyping about your age. At some point, does it become distracting that people constantly take your age into consideration whenever listening to your music?\nTS: I feel like it's been hyped the minimum amount that it could have possibly been hyped. When my label released my single to radio, they didn't say on any piece of press that I was 16. Of course people are going to talk about it because it is what it is. I am 17 years old, but part of me doesn't want to be a rebel too much and be like ‘stop saying I'm 17', because I am. I don't have a problem talking about my age because it's never been used as something to get me ahead-ever.\n\nMR: What event would you describe as your big break in the industry?\nTS: I don't consider my big break to have ever happened as a singer. My first break came as a songwriter when I was 14 years old and I was signed to a publishing deal with Sony Publishing. From that point on I was a paid songwriter. I would go in every day and write songs with some of the best songwriters in town. I met so many people through that and learned so many things so I really consider that to be my big break.\n\nMR: Is there anything about the music industry that is different than you thought coming into it?\nTS: If you had told me two years ago that I would be home one day a week if that, and that I would live in a bus and in airports, and be in a different state every single day - I don't know if I would have thought I could have handled it back then. Now that it's really happening in my life and I'm playing shows every night of the week, I realize that I can do it and it's not hard. This was a very gradual process for me, I had time to practice and prepare for all of this. Being on the road is my favorite part of what I do.\n\nMR: After your tour with George Strait is over, what are your plans?\nTS: We've already grouped the songs for the next album, and I begin to record in the next couple months. I wrote some of the new songs during the course of the publishing deal, so a lot of the songs are stuff that I've already written.\n\nMR: How do you want people to remember you when your career is over?\nTS: When people look back on my career, I'd love for them to look at what I've done and say wow, she wrote songs for herself but she also wrote that hit for someone else, and then someone else.\" I'd love for people to look back and say that I never took anything for granted and I appreciated everything that was ever given to me because everything can be taken away if I make one wrong move. I want people to look back and realize that I was really respectful of the music industry and my career - and that I sold millions and millions of albums.

What do you have to say to us girls who look up to you?\" Shannon Brado, Rochester, NY\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\nTaylor: That is so sweet. Thank you. Being a role model is one of the coolest things. I really do love it. When people come up to me and tell me that a song has really moved them or helped them in some way, I love that because I was that girl. I had role models that I looked up to and I know how beneficial it can be to your life — if you find a song that can say what you are thinking in a way that you thought you couldn't say.\nWhat I have to say to those girls is. thank you! That is the coolest thing that I have become a role model to people. I really just love it! It is so cool. I know how tough it is to become a role model to people. It is pretty tough criteria. I've been a 16-year-old girl, I've been a 17 year old girl, you know, and you're really tough with your music choices. I mean, you don't just listen to anything. It's gotta be good. You've gotta believe it, because people see through stuff and you can tell when something is honest and when it's not.\n\nAll I have to say is, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Please, please always be there for me because I'll always be here for you. That was a really great question.\n\n\"Maybe I'm Un-datable Right Now\"\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 27, 2007 at 6:11 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question:Have you ever been deeply in love?\" Mandie Mitchell, Boise, ID\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\n\nTaylor: >: I really don't think so. I've been in relationships and I thought I was in love. I've never had a love for anything that was enough to make me stop thinking about music. I've been in relationships but there was always something that I needed more. It never filled something that I felt like I was missing. Music is the only thing that could do that. Maybe I'm un-datable right now. I've been going through this independent phase where I haven't been interested in dating at all. For me, touring is kinda my life right now.It's been really great spending time with you guys! It's been great answering your questions. Thank you Shannon for the last question of the month. I will hopefully see you sometime out on the road. Come to one of my shows and I'd be glad to meet you.\n\nOne Thing Never to Say to Taylor\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 26, 2007 at 8:35 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question:What are the pros and cons of being a teenager in the country music industry?\" Shilo Adams, Isom, Kentucky\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\n\nTaylor: That is a really good question because there are a lot of both. A pro of being a teenager in the country music industry is because I feel like people my age haven't had a lot of people in country music that can speak directly to them. I've been there. I've been a country music fan, and I've been 17, so I know exactly what we go through, trying to find songs that we can relate to.\nI'll be the first to stand up and say \"Look, I'm 17! I've never been married or had a kid.\" I can't relate as much to the songs that are about that, as I can to songs that are about things that I have gone through. I think that's why so many young people listen to pop music — because younger people in pop music sing about younger things.\n\nThe cons of being a teenager in the country music industry is that you get some people that will talk down to you, like you don't know what you are doing. Some people ask questions like, 'So how do you feel about your rise to the top being so quick and you being so young? What could you possibly have to say, you are only 17?' I hate the phrase 'You're only 17! It's a horrible, horrible phrase and nobody should ever say it anymore! At least not with the undertones of, 'How could you possibly know?' Because if anyone has been paying attention to what's happening, I mean, obviously there's a place for somebody young to be in country music.\n\nI think people should never ever put an age limit on what someone can accomplish. My parents, ever since the day I was born, have empowered me. There are really two ways to look at it when you are raising kids. You can either say 'You can be whatever you want to be' and then there is actually believing it. My parents actually believed it and so when you get around people who don't believe that you can do whatever you want at whatever age you want, it gets a little frustrating. I think the pros definitely outweigh the cons in this situation. I try not to listen to the people who are negative because negative energy is not cool. It's been really good answering your question and I am glad that you addressed it.\nComments (14)\nHow To Stand Out\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 25, 2007 at 7:31 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question:I've been taking voice lessons for a little while. I have been singing since I was a baby. My dream is to be a young singer, like you are. What is your advice on trying to start out? Where should I start and when?\" Victoria Adamson, Tucson, AZ\n\nClick and listen to Taylor's audio answer:\n\n\n\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\n\nTaylor: This is a really cool question because I started singing really young too. I started performing, going to festivals and fairs, bars and karaoke contests ever since I was about 9 or 10. I came to Nashville with my little demo/karaoke CD and walked into every major record label and was like, 'Hey! I'm Taylor. I'm 11. I want a record deal.'\nAt that point I realized that there are girls in Nashville, thousands of them, that are gorgeous, have amazing voices and could pretty much sing me off a cliff. I had to figure out a way to stand out. I picked up a guitar and started to write songs and play my own music. I figured, if I could walk into a room and play my own guitar and sing songs that I've written, they can't touch that. I can literally not depend on anyone, creatively. That's exactly what I did.\n\nNobody makes it the same way. There are hundreds of country artists and I can pretty much vouch for the fact that nobody \"makes it\" the same way. It's always different. The way that I made it was that I was a songwriter first. I moved to Nashville and got a publishing deal with Sony, so I was a paid songwriter before I was a singer with a record deal. My advice is to just figure out who you are as an artist and what you bring. If you sound just like another artist, that's not what you are looking for. You need to sound exactly like you.\nComments (9)\nWhat's On Taylor's Bus?\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 24, 2007 at 6:05 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question:What are your must-have items when you travel?\" Sarah Jane Ryan, Nashville, TN\n\nClick and listen to Taylor's audio answer:\n\n\n\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\n\nTaylor: Some of my must-have items are makeup — I love makeup. It's not that I absolutely need it, but I really like it. I think it's fun. It's like art class. Also I like my cell phone, just because I like keeping in touch with people. I always have to be knowing exactly what's going on with my career at that moment. I'm always bothering my record label — 'Hey! What's going on today? What are we working on?' I am really annoying. Also, I love keeping in touch with my friends.\nI have an IPOD that I always take with me on the road. Let's see, what else do I take on the road with me a lot? I have these boots that have skulls on them, and then they have a pink bow on the top of the skull. They are really cute. They are Liberty boots and I always take them everywhere with me when I travel. So Sarah Jane, thank you so much!\nComments (11)\nThe Climate Wars\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 23, 2007 at 7:25 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question:What's the most common argument you have with your parents?\" Pat Monroe, Lexington, NC\n\nClick and listen to Taylor's audio answer:\n\n\n\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\n\nTaylor: This is going to sound horrible but the only real argument that I have with my mom is, the temperature on the tour bus. She likes it freezing, and I don't. I like the bus really, really hot. So usually, she'll turn the bus temperature all the way down to 65, and be like, 'Taylor! You've got to stop turning it up!' and then I'll be like, 'Okay Mom.'\nWhen she turns around to walk away I'll turn it back to 80. Then she'll come back and be like, 'Taylor!' So those are the only real arguments that we get in. My mom and I really get along and my dad and I get along really well so it's gotten to the point where all we argue about is stupid stuff. That's a really good question, Pat.\nComments (3)\nFamily Trust\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 22, 2007 at 7:17 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question:I saw your special on GAC and was so surprised at your maturity and wisdom, not to mention talent, for 16 years old. Where do you get that?\" Jill Rodomsky, Boiling Springs, SC\n\nClick and listen to Taylor's audio answer:\n\n\n\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\n\nTaylor: That is a really sweet question. Thank you Jill. I have seen what my friends have had to go through, and how they handle their problems. My parents have instilled a great level of trust in me and I think that's a huge, huge part of who I am. I can tell my mom everything, and I do. Before I make decisions, I always think, 'What is my mom going to think if I tell her this? Is my mom going to be really upset if she finds out that I did this?' Usually I decide, 'No, I'm not going to go through with this.'\nThat's the decision-making thing I always go through. I've had to make a lot of decisions. I think people kinda underestimate all the decisions every teenager has to make and how many life-changing choices they're faced with everyday. It's all how you handle them, and how you handle yourself. I've always been really privileged to have something I could hold onto in the back of my mind. Thanks for the compliment, I appreciate it.\nComments (6)\nDon't Make Taylor Angry\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 21, 2007 at 8:13 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: I really like your song \"Picture to Burn.\" Does the boy that you wrote the song about know it's about him, and how does he feel about it?\" Cole Edwards, Cordele GA\n\nClick and listen to Taylor's audio answer:\n\n\n\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\n\nTaylor: I don't know if he knows it's about him. Actually, I think that would be better because there would be lawsuits in order. No, I'm just kidding! The guy I wrote this song about, I didn't really ever \"officially\" date. We almost dated. It really bothered me that he was so cocky and that's where that song came from. After school, I would come into downtown. I had a publishing deal with Sony, and I would write songs every single day, exactly what I felt.\nI found myself just sitting there with my guitar going, 'I hate his stupid truck that he doesn't let me drive. He's such a redneck! Oh my God!' That actually became the chorus to the song, so that's one of the most honest songs I've ever written. I'm so glad you like that song. Hopefully it will be a single sometime so we can make a cool video with lots of angriness.\n\nComments (19)\nHow to Succeed\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 20, 2007 at 6:06 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: You have been an inspiration to me. I myself am a 17-year-old aspiring county singer. For teenagers like me who are hoping to become big singers and face the bumpy road to success, what do you suggest we do right now to prepare for a career in music and achieve the same success that you have?\" Jason Bleau, Quinebaug, CT\n\nClick and listen to Taylor's audio answer:\n\n\n\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\n\nTaylor: That's a really cool question. I started planning this out when I was 10 years old. I seriously went over everything that I could possibly do, all my options and started playing at festivals and fairs and karaoke contests. My advice to you is that you is to play anywhere you possibly can. Find something that will make you different. Are you one of those guys that wears a cowboy hat on stage, are you one of those guys that plays guitar? What do you do that makes you different? What's your thing?\nWhen you come to Nashville — which is pretty much what you have to do, by the way — what do you have to offer? Hopefully you make it because there really aren't many young, male country singers in the business at all, which makes me very sad. Good luck to you. When you get to Nashville, good luck.\n\nComments (21)\nStaying Positive\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 19, 2007 at 7:02 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"Was there ever a time when you were writing songs, making demos and trying to get a record deal when it was so difficult that you felt like giving up?\" Alyse Dusseault, Burrillville, RI\n\nClick and listen to Taylor's audio answer:\n\n\n\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\n\nTaylor: That's a really good question. I've been writing songs and making demos and trying to do this since I was about 12 years old. There were times when I didn't know if I was going to get a record deal, but never once did I ever think, \"I should just give this up, this is just not gonna work.\"\nI had people tell me, \"Wait — later. We'll sign you to a record deal later.\" No one ever said to me, \"Girl, you cannot do this.\" I thank God for that. Everybody has feelings and when I read a bad review, you can't help but let it get to you. Thankfully I had a lot of positive people around me. My parents were just so positive and I was able to get though and break through. If you keep a positive attitude, you will have such a better chance of accomplishing things.\n\nComments (6)\nTim McGraw — the Song\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 18, 2007 at 6:00 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"Why did you write the song \"Tim McGraw\"? Do you have a crush on Tim?\" Kenny Wooley, Greensville, MS\n\nClick and listen to Taylor's audio answer:\n\n\n\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\n\nTaylor: No Kenny, I don't have a crush on Tim McGraw. If anyone has heard this song and really listened to it, [they realize] it's not about Tim McGraw. It's about a relationship that I was in. Just to set the record straight, it wasn't with Tim McGraw. It was with this guy I was dating and he was about to go off to college and I was thinking about all the things that I knew would remind him of me.\nI didn't really think [of Tim McGraw personally] when I wrote this song. It was a song where I was listing personal things. One of things that I listed was that my favorite song is by Tim McGraw. No, I don't have a crush on Tim, at all. That was a good question. I guess I will talk to you guys tomorrow with another question of the day. Thanks Kenny.\n\nComments (24)\nSharing the Mike with Philip Sweet\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 17, 2007 at 6:58 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"I heard that you want to do a duet with Philip Sweet of Little Big Town. Do you have a song picked out?\" Debbie Thomas, Laurel, Maryland\n\nClick and listen to Taylor's audio answer:\n\n\n\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\n\nTaylor: No, I don't have a song picked out. I just thought that it would be cool, 'cause he's got a really great voice. Instead of a duet, it would be cool to have him sing backup on one of my songs. To the point that you could hear him, because he has one of the coolest voices that I think that I have ever heard. Little Big Town, I am such a huge fan of them and everything they do. They are such a organic group, and the rest of the band is just so cool too.\nWith \"Teardrops on My Guitar,\" I have a really strong male vocal in the background. If he would ever sing backup on one of my songs, I think it would be really cool. That was a really good question, Debbie. Thanks a lot. I will talk to you tomorrow with another question of the day.\n\nComments (3)\nTaylor's Dorky Secret\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 16, 2007 at 7:18 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"Your teeth are so perfectly straight and white to be so young. Is there anything special you do to keep them that way?\" Angela Langley, Siler City, NC\n\nClick and listen to Taylor's audio answer:\n\n\n\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\n\nTaylor: I love that question! Usually, I'm really insecure about my smile, but that's awesome. Thank you for saying that! I brush my teeth, I floss. There is really nothing that I do to keep them straight other than, I wear my retainer. Isn't that dorky? Isn't that great? You guys now know that I wear a retainer at night and usually when people aren't looking.\nThat's my little dorky secret of the day. I am glad that we've gotten that out in the open. Angela, that was a great question!\n\n\nComments (11)\nIs Taylor's Tattoo Real?\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 15, 2007 at 7:13 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"Do you have any tattoos?\" Brittney Rawlins, Providence, UT\n\nClick and listen to Taylor's audio answer:\n\n\n\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\n\nTaylor: This is kind of a popular question because on my album cover, I have this tattoo on my foot, of a heart. What most people don't know is that it is a henna tattoo and it's not real. It will be though, if my album goes double platinum. It's a pact that me, my friends, and my family all have made. We will all get a tattoo of a heart on our foot if my album goes double platinum. I definitely want that to happen, so go out and buy lots and lots of CDs, so that maybe that will happen sooner than later.\nI don't have any [real] tattoos and I am kinda scared to get one. I think it'll hurt. [But] if my album goes double platinum, you can be sure that I will have one, right there on my foot, just like you've seen on the CD cover. Thanks Brittney!\n\n\nComments (22)\nThe Ex Files\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 14, 2007 at 6:07 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"How do your ex-boyfriends, who you have written most of your songs about, like your music?\" LeAnn Pierce, Snow Hill, NC\n\nClick and listen to Taylor's audio answer:\n\n\n\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\n\nTaylor: There are particular ones that don't know and then there are some that use it as a 'badge of honor.' They think that they are really cool. I'll write a song about a guy cheating on me and then they'll be like: 'She wrote a song about me.' It's like, 'Did you even listen to it? Come on.'\nThe guy I wrote Tim McGraw about, I dated him for about a year and we are still friends, but we don't talk that much because his new girlfriend isn't too much of a fan. He really thought it was cool that, [even though] we weren't going out anymore, I remembered our relationship nicely. I think that he was happy that I didn't write 'Picture To Burn' about him, another song on my album. Ex-boyfriends, I don't have that many. You would really think I have a lot of them by listening to my album, but there have only been a couple. The way they feel about it — I can guarantee that I feel better about those songs. That's a great question, LeAnn!\n\n\nComments (2)\nI Am Woman\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 13, 2007 at 8:00 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"Who are your musical and non-musical influences?\" Erin Crabtree, Greenbrier, TN\n\nClick and listen to Taylor's audio answer:\n\n\n\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\n\nTaylor: My musical influences go from Dashboard Confessional to Miranda Lambert to George Strait to Little Big Town. I will listen to anything that I feel like is really good. When people ask me what my favorite type of music is, of course I love country music. But I love good music. Give me a song with amazing lyrics and I'll love it. So, musical influences come from every direction. Non-musical influences — my family, definitely. My mom was a big influence on me because she is a woman that I look up to. Before she had me, she was this really big business executive that worked for an ad agency. I really look up to that. I respect that she had a career on her own and lived alone. She had me when she was 30. She had a complete career of her own and was supporting herself.\nWomen inspire me because I think it is really cool when people accomplish things, especially women. I really look up to her for that. My dad I look up to because he is a super-fan! He loves anything I do. It is so cool to have someone so positive around who just gives me props for basically everything that I do. My mom is more down to earth, and keeps me grounded. My parents really just inspire me. Thank you for the question!\n\n\nComments (6)\nDetective Swift, at Your Service\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 12, 2007 at 8:56 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"What would you have done if you weren't a country star?\" Noelle Poropatich, Laguna Niguel, CA\n\nClick and listen to Taylor's audio answer:\n\n\n\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\n\nTaylor: I seriously need no time to answer that!\nIf I wasn't in country music, I would be in forensics. Like crime scene stuff. I'm so obsessed with crime scenes. It's really weird, I admit it. I have been in criminal justice classes for years. If I wasn't [a singer], songwriter would be my second choice. If somehow, music fell though completely, I would go to college and learn how to be in forensics because I am really into that sort of thing — crime scenes and figuring out how things happen and putting situations together. It is something I am really passionate about. So, that is a really, really good question. I don't think that I've told a lot of people about that, but Noelle, I would be some sort of cop or forensics detective.\n\nComments (6)\nWhere's the Dust Buster?\nTaylor Swift\nPosted on February 11, 2007 at 7:51 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"If you could, or had to, change one thing about yourself, what would it be?\" Chelsea Murray, McDonough, GA\n\nClick and listen to Taylor's audio answer:\n\n\n\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\nTaylor: This is actually a tough one, but it is a good one. Thanks. The thing that I would change about myself, is that I am really, really competitive. It is really good in some senses because it has driven me to the place I am right now. Sometimes it gets to be too much. I have never gotten to the point where I have been so competitive that it's been self-destructive. I think it's good to have a little competition in you, but not too much. Also, I worry a lot. I always over think everything. And, I am a compulsive cleaner. It kinda annoys people on my bus.\nThat is a really good question. I will talk to you guys tomorrow with another fan question of the day. Thanks Chelsea!\n\n\"Anti-Boyfriend Stage\"\nPosted on February 10, 2007 at 9:45 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"Is that your real boyfriend in your video \"Tim McGraw\" ?\" Bozena Gnjidic, Jacksonville, FL\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\nTaylor: No, it's not. He was a casted actor and he came from Alabama. His name is Clayton Collins, and I think that he lives in L.A. right now. He was a really sweet guy but definitely not my boyfriend. I have been in this anti-boyfriend stage for about a year now where I'm just like, 'I'm independent, I'm fine on my own.' I have been on tour for the last year so I haven't had a boyfriend for a really long time.\nBut the guy that \"Tim McGraw\" was written about looked a lot like the guy we picked for the video. That was done on purpose. He was really tall with dark hair. But that was not my real boyfriend. I don't have a real boyfriend. I'm single.\n\nSelf Confidence Is the Key\nPosted on February 9, 2007 at 7:40 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"You wrote \"Tied Together With a Smile\" about a friend who suffers from anxeoria. Would you ever want to raise funds for eating disorder awareness by using your talent?\" Brittany MacNealy, Starkville, MS\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\nTaylor: That is a really good question. Yeah, I wrote the song \"Tied Together With a Smile\" the day after I found out that one of my best friends who, a little back story on her, she's gorgeous. All the guys want to date her and all the girls want to be her. She is literally a pageant queen. I wrote this song the day I found out that she was bulimic and, you know, that is one of those moments when your heart kinda stops. How can somebody that seems so strong have such a horrible, horrible weakness? Something that is killing her. Luckily, I have talked to her about it and she has gotten help and she is fine now.\nEating disorders affect people all over the country. I always thought that one of the biggest overlooked problems American girls face is insecurity. Whether insecurity spurs anxeoria or whether it spurs some other eating disorder or not liking yourself, suicide, or hurting other people. It is all based from insecurity, and not being OK with yourself. I think that if people could just be confident about who they are and what they stand for, I there would be fewer problems in the world. I would love to help out societies that help eating disorders. That is a really, really good question.\n\nTaylor Swift, a.k.a. Betty Crocker\nPosted on February 8, 2007 at 8:36 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"What are your non-musical hobbies?\" Krysi Chrostek, Butler, TN\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\nTaylor: My non-musical hobbies include watching DVDs of TV shows on the bus. I am pretty much obsessed with Grey's Anatomy right now. That is my favorite show. Also CSI and Law & Order: SVU. We have DVDs of all the seasons of those shows on the bus and we watch them over and over again.\nI also like to bake. I like to cook a lot. I just made, like way too many cupcakes yesterday for no apparent reason at all. I baked like 40 cupcakes and had no reason to. Also, I love going to the mall to shop. So much of my life is taken up with music that there aren't that many non-musical hobbies, but the ones that are, are kinda interesting. Really great question. I have had fun answering it. Thanks Krysi!\n\nThe Challenge of Being a Teenager\nPosted on February 7, 2007 at 8:24 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"What do you do to balance being a popular recording artist and just being a teenager?\" John Stephenson, Mason City, IA\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\nTaylor: That is a really good question. What do I do to balance being a recording artist and just being a teenager? Well I think being a teenager is different for everybody. Everybody has different hobbies and everyone likes different things. I am just so restless, and I have always been up to challenges. I think that's why I like this business so much, is because it is challenge after challenge, and getting the next thing. Getting a gold record and then maybe I could get a platinum record, and all those dreams, you know? Really, the sky is the limit with the music industry. I just love it.\nSo being a teenager, I was in regular high school up until last year. I went to two proms, had the coolest friends in the world and had a great time but there were some things that I didn't really like to do that other teenagers my age like to do. I have never really been a partier. I'm kind of big dork. I was always afraid to go to parties because I was afraid people would be drinking and maybe the cops would show up and I couldn't risk it, I just couldn't. Part of who I am, and trying to be a role model is having responsibility.\n\nI like to hang out with my friends. I love going to the mall. I love doing all that stuff, but part of me is afraid of being a regular teenager [and] making those mistakes because for me there are bigger consequences. If I get in trouble, I get written up in newspapers. I have to constantly be afraid of that. Being a regular teenager to me is just having friends and coming back home every once in a while. I just love being on tour, I really do. It's like me being a soccer player, volleyball player. I am just gone a lot more and I am home schooled.\n\n\nLove Me, Love My Music\nPosted on February 6, 2007 at 8:04 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"Could you ever be friends with someone who liked you but hated your music?\" Samantha Elaine Birk, Graphton, OH\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\nTaylor: That is intriguing. I have never had that happen. I dated guys who didn't care about my music and that never ended well. I dated this guy who said, \"Oh, I just want you to know that I am dating you for you and not your music and I am dating you for who you are.\" That is very thoughtful but it doesn't really apply here because who I am is my music. I wake up in the morning and think about the next song that I am gonna write. My whole life is scheduled around my music. It's what I love, it's what I think about all the time.\nThere has to be a healthy balance with either a friend or a guy that I am dating, of course. I don't want them to use me for publicity or to try to get my money or whatever they feel like they could use me for. Of course you don't want that. That wouldn't be good at all. There has to be a fine balance. You can't ignore it because it does exist. I am a singer and songwriter. I am a country singer. This is what I do. Whoever is friends with me needs to realize that — it is so much a part of me.\n\nBeing in the \"Friend Zone\"\nPosted on February 5, 2007 at 8:03 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"I love your new single, \"Teardrops On My Guitar.\" What is the story behind that song?\" Sylvia Davis, Asheboro, NC\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\nTaylor: Well, thank you, first of all. Good question. The story behind this song, as most of you know, I was in high school this time last year. I got a lot of song inspiration from that. This song is about a guy who sat next to me in class, and I had the biggest crush on him. I was definitely in the \"friend zone.\" He would talk to me every day about his girlfriend, and how happy they were, and how awesome she was and blah, blah, blah. I would just sit there and fake a smile and tell him how happy I was for him. I never told him that I liked him and it absolutely was killing me. So I wrote a song with his name in it and this song is definitely the product of that — never being able to tell them that you like them.\nI think a lot of people have been through that, where it is just killing you. You want to be able to tell them but you can't. I came to the realization that, if I am his friend, I'll do anything to make him happy — even if what makes him happy isn't me. That was kind of a hard thing to come to terms with, and one way was to write this song. I cannot wait for you to see the video! We just shot it. I am just really excited to have this song out there.\n\nThe Dating Game\nPosted on February 4, 2007 at 8:58 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"Have you ever dated a superstar your age? If so, who? If not, who would you like to date?\" Tinley Ross, Orange Park, FL\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\nTaylor: No, I have never dated a superstar at all, mostly because there are no superstars my own age. Also, the guys I do date, I haven't dated in a year…seriously. I haven't even talked to a guy unless he is a meet and greet line. In about a year, things have just been so busy, so it is so hard. I think I would be a pretty difficult person to date, because of my schedule and because you have to understand music to even be on the same wavelength, since I love music so much and I talk about it a lot. But I don't think dating is something that I have really thought about until you asked this question. I am kinda like, 'Who would I like to date.' I'll think about that. But you know, I think it would just be better to stay single.\n\nHave Sharpie, Will Sign\nPosted on February 3, 2007 at 8:56 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"Taylor, girls want to be you and guys want to date you. I have noticed that MySpace friends speak of suicide if they don't meet you. In these past two and a half months, you have become such a role model for so many young people out there. How do you cope with your stardom?\" Zachary Bryson, Rossmoor, CA\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\nTaylor: That is a really flattering question. I think I am going to dwell on that for awhile — just kidding. I think it is really cool when I go into a public space and people ask for my autograph. It's fun, that's what I wanted it when I came into this. It really bothers me when famous people get all mad when people ask for their autograph. They are like \"Oh my God, my privacy has been invaded; everyone wants to talk to me.\" This is what I asked for. This is what I've wanted since I was a little kid. I want to be known for my music.\nWhen someone comes up to me and says, 'I was just listening to your CD, this song helped me get through thisâ€¦' That is the coolest thing ever. There is nothing wrong with that. When I am in a public place, I love to talk to people. If you ever see me out, I definitely want to talk to you. I am not one of those people who is ever going to be shy or anything about music. It's what I do. I am very happy that people know me for it.\n\nYou also have to keep your feet on the ground. I'm still a normal person. My parents have always grounded me. You mentioned in your question about how I am role model. If I make the wrong mistake, let down that responsibility, even for a second, it could all be gone. Because who is going to believe me when I am saying things if I can't justify it by acting right? I am always going to be conscious when people are watching me and will always try to do the right things as much as possible. Good question. Thank you so much. I will talk to you guys tomorrow with another GAC question of the day.\n\nWanted: 1 Cute Country Singing Hunk\nPosted on February 2, 2007 at 8:53 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"Who do you consider the hottest guy in the world of country music?\" Lauren Pavnica, Highland, IN\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\nTaylor: There are so many hot guys in country music. I think everyone listening to this will agree with me. I think one of the hottest guys in country music is Jake Owen. He is really nice too, which is the thing. I also think that Philip Sweet from Little Big Town is extremely hot. But the thing is, I can only look — I'm 17. So basically I can just stand there and be like \"Wow!\". They are hot but I can't really do anything about it.\n\nBut you know what needs to happen? There need to be some young, hot guys in country music. You know what I am saying? There needs to be some hot, like 18-year-old country music singer. Anybody listening to this, who is young and hot, and a country singer, definitely needs to get a record deal so that I can include you in my list of hot guys in country music on my GAC questions. That was a really good question, Lauren. Thanks for asking, I'll see you next time.\n\nBest Friend Forever\nPosted on February 1, 2007 at 8:45 AM\n\nToday's Fan Question: \"Did you have a best friend in high school and do you still stay in touch?\" Carla Larkin, Higbee, MO\n\nRead Taylor's Answer:\nTaylor: That is a really good question. Actually yes, I have a best friend — Abigail Anderson in Hendersonville, Tennessee. We met when I first moved to Hendersonville and started going to HHS, which is where I went to school up until a year ago. We became best friends right away, and we had English class together. We went through just about everything together. As soon as I released a single, I was gone a lot on radio tours. I lost touch with a lot of people. It's like out of sight out of mind when you are gone. You figure out who your real friends are. Abigail has been one of the ones that I have stayed in touch with through everything. I have every Sunday off, so I usually spend it with her.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift - A Place In This World\nTaylor Swift's story is being written; but believe it or not, this is only her first chapter, musically speaking. Her story begins in the small farm town of Wyomissing, PA where at the age of 10 she started performing at karaoke contests, festivals and county fairs. The first inkling that Taylor was going to be a star was when she sang the national anthem at a Philadelphia 76ers game at the tender age of 11. A year later she picked up a 12 string guitar and set out to be a songwriter. Taylor inherited her musical ability from her grandmother, a professional opera singer, and was supported by her family, who started charting regular visits to Nashville, TN to further her career. Eventually they moved to closer to Nashville to enable her to pursue her dream as a singer/songwriter. After writing about 250 songs (yes, that many) she started to work with other songwriters, like Robert Ellis Orrall and Liz Rose, and developed as an artist.\n\nNow she's making appearances pretty much everywhere from stock car races and award shows, to highly visible concert tours. There is a lot on the horizon for this rising star. I talked with Taylor as she was getting ready for her debut performance on the Academy of Country Music Awards (ACM's), where she serenaded Tim McGraw with her hit \"Tim McGraw,\" a song he obviously inspired. This was right on the heels of her CMT (Country Music Television) Music Award for Breakthrough Video for the same song.\n\nJackie Lee King: First of all, congratulations on the CMT award.\n\nTaylor Swift: Thank you. Oh-my-gosh, the CMT awards - I could not believe that that happened. I went into that whole situation thinking, \"You know what; I'm not going to win. It's gonna be great to be nominated for something for a start, I've never been. I haven't even been out long enough to be nominated for anything yet, so the CMT award was my first nomination. And it's [the award] fan voted completely; so I was completely overwhelmed with emotion when I accepted the award.\n\nJLK: What's been the highlight of your day?\n\nTS: The highlight of my day so far is trying on the dresses that have been custom made for me for the ACM's this year. I have a performance dress that I'm wearing, cause I'm performing and I'm pretty excited about that, and it's like cream colored and it's got feathers at the bottom and it's so cute. And the red carpet dress is corseted so I can't even breathe at all, but it's really cute.\n\nJLK: Isn't that going to make you a little more statuesque? What are you 5' 11?\"\n\nTS: Yeah and that's the number one comment when people meet me for the first time, is, \"Wow I didn't think you would be this tall.\"\n\nJLK: What else do you think the fans should know about you?\n\nTS: The funny thing about me is that I kind of say everything that comes to mind and don't really hold too much back. I don't have a lot of secrets. Drew and Cory [people mentioned in two of Taylor's songs] are all real people. That's like a huge question that I get all the time: \"Are they real people?\" Yeah, they are people.\n\nJLK: You sound like you're really over them too.\n\nTS: Well you know, just a little bit. But you know, I love it though, because you know in my situation you can be going though a really tough time - like something that would inspire \"Teardrops On My Guitar\" [Taylor's second single off of her record] - and you know you don't get the guy, but you get a song that goes to radio and does well for you and makes you smile. So it kind of works out to your advantage no matter what happens.\n\nJLK: Do you keep up Drew and Cory?\n\nTS: No, I don't actually. Usually, like after I write a song about somebody, I kind of get over it. If it's a heartbreak song or something like it, it usually helps me get though it, and I've actually gotten a few missed calls from Mr. \"Teardrops On My Guitar.' And I'm not going back, because he's still got a girlfriend. What am I gonna say? That's probably the number one most awkward conversation ever.\n\nJLK: What's a moment of weakness for you?\n\nTS: Food is my moment of weakness, because I don't diet. I don't like it. For me, I would eat healthy , but I refuse to use the term \"diet.' For a while there, I put out a single, and I was like, \"I gotta get in shape man, I'm going on a diet.' And then I realized that's ridiculous. I'm happy with how I look and I'm not gonna you know...if I want to eat a cheeseburger it's going to happen.\n\nJLK: So what does Taylor say no to?\n\nTS: (After a mischievous laugh) The thing is that, I've never cheated on anybody or done drugs or gotten drunk or anything like that, so there's not much to that, so I'm trying to think out of the box here. I don't know...let me come back to that. I need to think.\n\nSince releasing her self titled debut in October of 2006 she has been constantly on the road. She's toured with country music stars George Strait, Ronnie Millsap, Rascal Flatts, Kenny Chesney, and is currently on tour with Brad Paisley (with Jack Ingram and Kellie Pickler). She is scheduled to appear on the Faith Hill / Tim McGraw tour this summer as well.\n\nJLK: You are touring insanely, why is that?\n\nTS: Because it's the only thing that keeps me sane. Honestly, when I come home I literally just don't know what to do with myself, because I feel like I should be doing a meet and greet line or doing something.\n\nJLK: What are you missing, being on the road?\n\nTS: Right now what I'm missing is the high school junior and senior year. I went to two proms, I got to go to two years of high school, I have great friends - but you couldn't pay me enough money to go back. I've always had different interests. I've never been a party girl; I've never been into that, that's just not me. I've always wanted to play music. And that fact - that I'm getting to do that - I'm so excited.\n\nIt's persistence that has made her successful. That kind of dedication can be grueling, but it seems to energize Taylor. When not on package tours with other artists, she's doing solo performances, meet and greets, and has even found time to prank Brad Paisley by appearing on stage in a tick costume, with fellow tour mates Kelly Pickler (Tick #2) and Jack Ingram (the Exterminator) during Paisley's performance of the song Tick. Taylor had been warned about Brad's practical jokes and wanted to strike first.\n\nJLK: What future pranks do you have for Brad Paisley?\n\nTS: I can't tell you about the things that I have in production at the moment. I have an arsenal of pranks just in case he fires back. And I know he's going to, because I was kind of talking with him afterwards, and he was kind of hinting around that he was basically going to demolish me with pranks. So I figure when he strikes next I'll have the next new one ready.\n\nJLK: On your website, you mention that the number 13 is lucky for you, can you explain why?\n\nTS: I was born on December 13 th, I turned 13 on Friday the 13 th, I played on Jay Leno on February 13 th. My album went gold in 13 weeks, the CMT voting for breakthrough video of the year the voting stopped on April 13 th. When I was at the CMT awards my record label had a row of seats arranged, and they didn't know what row it was going to be, and when they got there [...] the ticket said that they were in letter M, which is the thirteenth letter, and my record label president's seat number was seat 13.\n\nJLK: Are there going to be 13 songs on your new album?\n\nTS: I should put 13 songs on my new album. I'm actually about to start recording it. I've got, like, 75 written, and we just have to whittle it down to whatever number of songs we want to put on the album, and start recording.\n\nTaylor's musical writing comes across as a conversation that you would have with family and friends on your grandma's porch. She's just as approachable as her songs as she invites you to share in her world, and she holds nothing back. It's dizzying how her mind works: relentless and constant. She has the energy of her youth and the wisdom of age; an odd yet very refreshing collusion. She prefers dresses to jeans, but doesn't like high heels for fear that she may fall in public. Taylor is quirky and playful in conversation, as in her songs, but really just keeps it simple.\n\nJLK: How is the new album going?\n\nTS: I wrote this song that I'm really excited about called \"Fearless.\" It's about the best first date that I haven't been on yet. I just try and put myself in the position of \"this is really happening,' and what would happen on the coolest first date. So I haven't ever written a song about, you know, that feeling before. I've written songs, but I haven't recorded them or put them on an album, and so I think that would be a cool. It's about angry, not sad . The whole thing - I think it's really going to be cool for people to see that sort of song coming out of me. I would tell you about every single song on the album right now, I just can't wait for you to hear it.\n\nJLK: What is your writing process?\n\nTS: Well, for me they happen different ways. Like with \"Tim McGraw\" I basically started singing to myself, \"When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song.' In my head it all came at once as a phrase with the melody and words. For other songs, I'll get a title. It will come into my head and I'll work backwards from that and I'll get a hook. But other times I'm just messing around on the guitar, and a really cool melody will just kind of come at me and which ever way I feel that it goes either happy or sad; angry or whatever I feel plays into it, I'll write around that.\n\nTaylor SwiftJLK: What are some of your influences?\n\nTS: I love Sheryl Crow a lot, and I think she's great. The candidness of her writing and how she tells it like it is, but still is vulnerable. I love that about her. I love Brad Paisley a lot and I'm lucky to be able to be touring with him. I think he's a genius, the way he writes. He can write something so touching it can make you cry, and then he can make you laugh so hard that you can't breathe.\n\nJLK: One last comment?\n\nTS: The second album will trump the first. That's a guarantee.\n\nJust then Taylor comes up with an answer to my previous question about what she should have said no to.\n\nTS: Oh...something I should have said no to the other day was...on the bus as it was going down the road and my fiddle player Emily was like, \"Hey can you pass me the remote' and I got up and went to get it for her and fell and busted up my arm. I'm just really a clumsy girl. I should have just said no to that. \"You know what Emily, you go get the remote.'\n\nHer current CD is a collection of stories of Taylor's career, but it's certainly not the last chapter in her book. She has the one-two punch of being a singer/songwriter. With a continually expanding catalogue of songs under her belt there is no doubt that this is the beginning of a long and prolific career. After all, she is the first female artist in country music to write or co-write every song on a Platinum selling debut. I can't wait for the next chapter.\n\n",

      "Transcript/Content": "On the Scene: The ACM Awards\n\nAlthough he didn’t win anything, Tim McGraw (pictured) managed to provide two of the key highlights of Tuesday night’s Academy of Country Music Awards show, broadcast from Las Vegas. One of these peak moments had McGraw getting on stage for an unexpected performance of a brand new song that had audience members simultaneously wiping away tears (because of the moving nature of the song) and scratching their heads (because they were trying to figure out if they’d ever heard it before, and why he wasn’t shilling his current single). As for that other high point, McGraw didn’t even have to get out of his seat.\n\nThe latter bit was mostly the work of 17-year-old Taylor Swift, who has one of the genre’s biggest hits of the year with “Tim McGraw,” which has sold over 500,000 units as a digital download in addition to her 700K in album sales. Earlier that day, I found Swift in her makeup chair, where she discussed her plans for the evening: “I’m not gonna be playing it with a band. I’m gonna do it on an acoustic guitar. I’ve never met Tim” — not counting a phone conversation — “and he’s gonna be sitting in the front row. So I’ll be walking off the stage and playing it two feet in front of him. I think right afterward, I’ll be like, ‘Hey, I’m Taylor.'” Surely he would be in on it? “No, he doesn’t know,” she insisted. “It’s a complete surprise.” But what if, I suggested, always eager to propose the worst-case scenario, McGraw just up and bolted? “Hopefully, I’m not that scary. Hopefully.” If you’ve ever seen her, you can safely guess that McGraw did not, in fact, flee the scene in terror. (Actually, her 5’11” stature can be intimidating, but there are compensating factors.) Their oft-postponed introduction turned out to be a Great Moment in Awards Show Hokum.\n\nSwift wasn’t the only one with a surprise up her sleeve (figuratively speaking; sleevelessness becomes her). Just beforeshowtime, McGraw and Faith Hill had done the red carpet together (actually, at the ACMs, it’s traditionally an orange carpet, in honor of… I don’t know what). “I know what he’s performing, but we want itto be a surprise,” she told me. Hill was set to perform a new single,”Lost,” that she recorded for an upcoming best-of just last week, so noone would’ve guessed that McGraw would debut a new tune, too, much lessone that hadn’t even been put down on tape yet. But toward the end ofthe three-hour telecast, McGraw appeared sans introduction and sang awar-themed ballad that only the next day were we able to confirm istitled “If You’re Reading This.” It’s in the form of a letter intendedby a soldier to be opened by his widow upon his death, with lines like”Lay me down in that open field on the edge of town” and “If you’rereadin’ this, I’m already home.” At the end, the lights went up on acrowd of people gathered behind the singer, some holding up pictures offallen soldiers, while the legend “Families of Fallen Heroes” appearedon screen overhead. A scan of the front row showed fellow artists likeMartina McBride drying their eyes, but you could see the puzzled lookson other faces: Did he really just give up a shot to push his newalbum, in primetime? Honest, spontaneous sentiment trumping careerism?No wonder we were all a bit confused.\n\nI wasn’t sure what to make of another tribute, this one offered byRascal Flatts. Their quasi-gospel tune, “He Ain’t the Leavin’ Kind,”ended with photographs of all the Virginia Tech massacre victimsprojected on screen, followed by a printed message of sympathy signedby “Rascal Flatts.” Reasonable enough. But the first part of the songcomplained about the infamous case a few years ago where the 10 Commandments were removed from a judge’s courtroom in Alabama, completewith video footage of pro-Commandments protesters being arrested.Should sympathy for the Virginia victims really be conflated with acontroversial conservative political position? The conjoining of theseunrelated and highly charged causes felt awkward, at the very least.\n\nThank God, then, for the kind of greatness that all Americans canagree on, by which, of course, I mean the sublimity that is BradPaisley’s “Ticks.” That and Miranda Lambert’s “Famous in a Small Town”certainly lead our list of 2007’s best country songs, no matter whatthe nominations show this time next year. And, perhaps notincidentally, Paisley and Lambert were among the half-dozen acts (outof 20) who performed completely live; the other 14 had live vocals butband members miming to pre-recorded backing tracks. (Here’s a roll callof the brave six: Lambert, Paisley, Brooks & Dunn, Vince Gill,McGraw, and of course, the solo-acoustic Swift.) Though they didn’tquite qualify in that totally-live category, Big & Rich also tooksome chances and mixed it up, inviting R&B star John Legend — whoguests on “Eternity,” a different song on their about-to-be-releasedalbum — to join them as a duet partner and (live) pianist on “Lost inThis Moment,” their current single. But for rocking out, there was nobeating Gill’s climactic raveup, “Sweet Thing,” which climaxed with aguitar solo lasting exactly 90 seconds. (When was the last time youheard a minute-and-a-half rock guitar solo on TV in any context? Justcurious.)\n\nOpening the show with a brief monologue, returning host RebaMcEntire riffed on the “What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas” mantra,noting, “It sure didn’t stay here last year when I made a few jokesthat were talked about everywhere” — presumably referring to some gagsshe made at the Dixie Chicks’ expense that didn’t go over universally wellin ’06. Playing it safer this time, McEntire was saddled with some of thegroaningest — albeit completely inoffensive — one-liners conceivable.(Example: Britney Spears has a new country band called “RascalFlattop”… The all-male list of nominees for entertainer of the yearreminds her of West Hollywood… Brooks & Dunn’s trophy room “ismore crowded than Angelina Jolie’s supper table”… Oy.) For the loveof God, Reba is a gifted comedienne who had a successful sitcom onanother network for several seasons; can’t CBS shell out just one nighta year to supply the poor woman with some professional comedy writers?\n\nReba also participated in what should’ve been, and nearly was, aperformance highlight: a duet with Kelly Clarkson on “Because of You,”the leadoff single from the host’s forthcoming duets album. McEntire,the most consummate of consummate professionals, was completely onpoint, as always… but Clarkson was strangely muted, as if she thoughther role was to be a backup harmonizer, not full vocal partner. We’llsee if things seem more equal when the studio version of the singlehits radio this week.\n\nThe winners? You care? No, really? Not surprisingly, Kenny Chesneywon the top entertainer of the year prize again; also not surprisingly,in a typical example of spreading the wealth, Chesney gave up thelesser best male vocalist prize, this time not to Keith Urban but tofirst-time winner Paisley. Carrie Underwood, picking up three awards(best album, best video, best female vocalist), was hardly a surprise,though it was a slight shocker that, for single of the year and bestsong, her run of smashes was passed over in favor of George Strait’sgreat, droll, sad-sack divorce anthem, “Give It Away.” Other winnersincluded: Rascal Flatts, best vocal group; Brooks & Dunn, for vocalduo, vocal event, and a charitable honor; Lambert, best new femaleartist; Rodney Atkins, best new male; Little Big Town, best new group.\n\nNo one takes the ACMs quite as seriously as the CMA Awards in November(to the extent that any of these are taken seriously). But as KelliePickler enthused to us on the orange carpet: “This is more laid backthan the CMAs — more casual, and a lot more fun, because we’re inVegas!” Of course, those who did win will be hoping the public memory of what happened there won’t completely stay there.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Scott Borchetta, the head of her record label, jokes that she’s an alien. There’s no way Taylor Swift can be real.\n\nHere’s this captivating 17-year-old with a certified gold debut album, who has written 250 songs, kept a 4.0 grade point average up until the day her first single was released, visits a bundle of radio stations every day and is about to jump from a George Strait tour to a Brad Paisley jaunt.\n\nShe keeps up on her studies while on the bus, and is set to graduate on time next spring. Meanwhile, she has met a lot of people along the way.\n\nRick Barker, when he was the West Coast regional rep for Big Machine Records, told her if she wanted to sell 500,000 albums, she’d need to meet 500,000 people.\n\n“He was the first one to ever say that to me and it sunk in,” Swift told Pollstar. She took the philosophy to heart and, since her debut dropped last year, she has invested her life into meet-and-greets, press and touring. She is playing to arena-sized crowds yet recently played an Academy of Country Music board meeting.\n\n“I literally had a Top 10 single and no manager,” Swift said. “We held off for a while because we kept saying, ‘Oh well, we’ll get this song Top 30 and then we’ll be able to get a better manager. Oh, we’ll get this song Top 20 and then we’ll get a really good manager.’ Then we started realizing that we’re doing this whole thing ourselves.”\n\n\nTaylor Swift\nBecause Barker was one of those most responsible, he’s phasing out his position at the label and taking on the role of manager.\n\n“It’s funny because, when I first started at Big Machine Records, we kept Taylor’s management in-house,” Barker said. “We needed to be able to move at the speed of light with a 16-year-old, and trying to convince someone else of the plan would have taken way too much time.”\n\nBarker – a 15-year radio vet – was given the task of introducing Swift to her first radio tour, and they took off on a two-week run.\n\n“One of the things I said to her early on was, ‘Listen, I’ll be honest with you as long as you can show me you can handle it. And then, when you show me you can’t, I’ll just blow smoke up your butt like we do every other artist and tell you how great you are.’ And she looked at me square in the eye and said, ‘I want to learn.’”\n\nBarker soon realized that Swift had the ability to take over a room. Her people skills were tremendous, and that’s what would set her apart from the other pretty faces in Nashville. So, because there was no support from television, Swift “shook hands, kissed babies and made friends.”\n\nBut Barker kept hearing from naysayers that this girl would only appeal to teenyboppers. So, on the fifth day of the tour, at the 21-and-over Buffalo Club in Boise, Barker had her play for an hour and do a meet-and-greet that lasted longer than the show. Afterward, she asked him why she had to do it. “I said, ‘Because now I have a story. Now I can let people know that you’re not going to just be booked for bar mitzvahs, quinceaneras and sweet 16 birthday parties. Your music appeals to an adult audience. I needed that story and you allowed me to have it.’” Now that the record is gold, and 500,000 people have met Swift and bought her record, television is finally coming on board, with names like Leno and Regis on the calendar. It took Swift six years to get to this point. She had been visiting Nashville offices since she was 12 and got a publishing contract at 14. “People say, ‘Oh, she hasn’t paid her dues,’” Barker said. “Trust me: not the right thing to say.” Swift’s first single is called “Tim McGraw,” although the song is about associating music with a memory, not about the country singer. Still, it turns out she’s got a lot in common with McGraw – namely, her booking agent. CAA’s Rod Essig, who has booked McGraw since the early years, is also booking the start of Swift’s career. “You can get a booking agency when you don’t have a record deal,” Swift said, “so we wanted to hold off to see who was really passionate about it. It seemed that CAA was really ready to step to the plate, and Rod has always been a dear friend of mine. He’s such a cool person and so positive. CAA has been pretty good for us so far.” Barker said he and Swift joke around every week that she’s going to let him go but, in all honesty, they’re both out to prove that an early manager can stay with an artist throughout the career. “She could have picked anyone in Nashville, and she picked me,” he said. “That will change my life. Let’s be honest.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Interview with Swift\n\nJuly 17, 2007 – Recently we chatted with Taylor Swift who talked about her debut album going platinum, a responsibility to be a role model to her younger fans and when she plans on going into the studio to record her next album among other things.\n\nFES: Your self-titled debut album has been certified Platinum. What went through your mind when you found this out?\n\nTaylor: I found out about my album going platinum while I was signing autographs at CMA Music Fest in Nashville.. It was the coolest thing to get told that sort of thing in front of fans, simply because they’re the only reason why my album went platinum. It was such an awesome feeling, and some days I STILL can’t believe it! \n\nFES: Going into the recording studio how many songs were written and how did you decide which songs would make it onto the album and which ones would not? \n\nTaylor: I sat down with my record label and went through songs before we started recording. There were about 40 that we wanted to put on the CD. But we had to narrow it down. I wrote every song on the album, and that’s another thing that I’m really thankful for. There were about 10 songs that we left off the first album that I can’t WAIT to put on the second album.\n\nFES: “Tim McGraw” is said to be about a summer love. How did you come about to give this song its name?\n\nTaylor: After I wrote this song, I didn’t think it was a hit. I didn’t even think it would ever see the light of day. I completely forgot about it, until I was playing my record label president a few songs and my dad said “Hey, play him that Tim McGraw song you wrote” and with some hesitation (and a “You’re probably going to think this is stupid” warning), I did. He loved it. When I first wrote it, the song was called “When You Think Tim McGraw”, but whenever we would play it or talk about it, it just got shortened to “Tim McGraw”. \n\nFES: What did Tim McGraw say to you after you introduced yourself to him? \n\nTaylor: He was so nice, and Faith was absolutely amazing. We were talking about how excited we were to be going on tour together. It was at the ACMs, so it was all happening really fast. \n\nFES: What can you tell us about “Teardrops on my Guitar” that you haven’t \nalready talked about? \n\nTaylor: Drew called me. Like five times. I let those go to voicemail. Ha-ha. Sometimes it’s just too little, too late.\n\nFES: How difficult was it for you to get inked to a record deal by Big Machine Records and did you have to showcase for them at all? \n\nTaylor: I had just left a development deal with RCA, so I was doing a showcase for a bunch of different labels. It was just me and my guitar, playing at the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville. Scott Borchetta hadn’t even started Big Machine at that time, but he came up to me after the show and said “I want you to wait for me.. I’m working on something.” The way he said it convinced me that there was something going on that I probably would want to be a part of.\n\nFES: it’s been said your second album is due for release in 2008. Can you tell \nus anything about this album and has the release date been etched in stone \nyet? \n\nTaylor: The release date isn’t etched in stone, but I CAN tell you that I’m SO excited about this album. There is not shortage of songs, and there will be no sophomore jinx.  I’ve started to play a few new songs at some of my theatre shows when I get to headline. It’s crazy how fast those recordings spread. I love how passionate people are about my new music.\n\nFES: Your scheduled to perform on CMA Music Festival: Country’s Night to Rock \n[which airs July 23, 2007, on ABC television]. Do you have any idea what \nsong(s) you will be performing? \n\nTaylor: At the concert, I played “Our Song”,” Tim McGraw” and “Picture to Burn” but I think they’re just airing “Tim McGraw”. I can’t wait to see it on TV! \n\nFES: What went through your mind when you were asked to perform on this show? \n\nTaylor: It was such an amazing feeling, because I have always considered that show to be a huge moment for any artist’s career. Like a really good sign that you’re doing the right things and you’re on your way. I freaked out, as usual, and started screaming. \n\nFES: Are there any other TV performances scheduled for 2007 you’d like to tell us about?\n\nTaylor: We’ll keep you posted, but there’s going to be some stuff around the holidays.\n\nFES: What are your tour plans for the remainder of 2007? \n\nTaylor: I’m going to be on tour with Brad Paisley ‘til November, and I’m really happy about that. This tour feels like home! Then December and January is dedicated to recording album number two. I’m more stoked about that than you can even imagine.\n\nFES: You’ve performed our National Anthem at NBA games, NASCAR races and NFL games do you ever get nervous before singing the national anthem? \n\nTaylor: Hmm, It’s a lot of pressure, and it’s a seriously vocally challenging song,  but overall I really love singing it. A lot of the time, I’ll play my guitar while I’m singing it.. To me, it feels like that helps to turn it back into a song, rather than just a vocal performance. \n\nFES: Do you feel a responsibility to be a positive role model to your younger \nfans? \n\nTaylor: Of course, I feel responsible. I think sometimes people in this position don’t realize that there is no on/off switch for being a role model. As soon as you put out a song, and one person likes it, you’re a role model. There’s no way to turn that off, and say “No, I’m not responsible for your kids”.  You are. It’s just a matter of whether you choose to embrace it, or ignore it. I personally love it. It really keeps you in line, and I like that. I’ve never been a partier, or anything like that, but knowing that there are thousands of little girls who have my album and watch how I behave is really a great thing for me. Every time I’m faced with a decision or a choice, I think about the 6-year-old girl in the front row of my concert, and what she’d think about it. Then I think about her mom, and what she’d think. I never lose sight of what’s really important. To me, it’s those girls. \n\nFES: Is there anyone you would like to thank for the success you have achieved \nso far? \n\nTaylor: If you read the thank you section in my album booklet, you’ll notice it’s like reading a novel. I could never have done this alone, and there are so many people who’ve helped me out over the years. I’m really lucky to have a great team of people around me, and an amazing family. \n\nFES: Where do you see yourself say five (5) years from now? \n\nTaylor: In five years, I’ll be 22. I’d really like to be starting to headline. I think that would be amazing. I’d love to have another platinum album, and I’d love to have won some sort of award (an ACM or CMA, I don’t care). Five years is a long time, so who knows what might happen. I never thought all of this would happen in one year, so I can’t wait to see my life in five! \n\nFES: Do you have anything to say to your fans who read this interview? \n\nTaylor: You’re the best fans in the world.  I’m blown away every day by how dedicated and passionate they are. I look at the record sales every week, and things like my CMT Award, and I’m like “This is CRAZY. I love these people!” I really don’t think there should be a wall between artists and fans. That’s why my album is so personal. I think it’s just better to be honest with people. Being vulnerable isn’t always a bad thing, especially when it comes to expression. I love everyone on Myspace who’s helped me get things moving. I’m just so thankful to everybody for helping me out the way they have.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Getting to know Taylor Swift\n\nSeventeen-year-old country star Taylor Swift talks about walking away from a major deal, acting her age, and ''Tim McGraw''\n\nBy Chris Willman | Published on July 25, 2007 04:00AM EDT\n\nWho’s the biggest new female artist of 2007? In at least one sense, and possibly a couple of others, it would have to be country upstart Taylor Swift. Literally, for starters: At 5’11”, she’s hard for anyone to measure up to — even Amy Winehouse on a full towering-beehive day. And at age 17, she’s sold more than a million copies of her self-titled and largely self-penned debut album, which was released when she was 16. (With sales consistently averaging between 30-40K a week, double platinum is a foregone conclusion by the end of the year.) Her two singles have gone like gangbusters, too, with ”Tim McGraw” selling more than 625,000 as a digital download and ”Teardrops on My Guitar,” the follow-up, selling 457,000 so far. Only Miley Cyrus, a.k.a. Disney Channel’s Hannah Montana, can match that, but Swift has done it without the benefit of massive TV exposure.\n\nShe’s currently on tour in amphitheaters, opening for Brad Paisley. ”Taylor Swift was one that I called my manager when I heard her album and said, ‘We have to get her out on tour,”’ says Paisley. ”And for her to have written that record at 16, it’s crazy how good it is. I figured I’d hear it and think, ‘Well, it’s good for 16’ — but it’s just flat-out good for any age.”\n\nEW sat down with Swift recently for a piece in our Spotlight pages; here’s some more of that chat.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Tim McGraw told me the only thing he was worried about when he heard about your song was that it might be taking a shot at him.\nTAYLOR SWIFT: That would probably be the only thing I would worry about too, if [there were] a song called ”Taylor Swift,” that they weren’t making fun of me, like that ”Go Away Paris Hilton” song. ”Go Away Taylor” — as long as it wasn’t that, it would be fine.\n\nYou’ll probably be a multiple nominee at the CMAs this fall.\nI have all these countdowns on my phone for the CMAs and all the awards shows. I get so excited about these things because I love to dress up. But I wear cowboy boots so that when I walk down the stairs I won’t fall. I have this fear of falling in front of large groups of people. That’s why I tend not to wear heels.\n\nI was going to ask if you wear heels often, since that might make you a pretty towering presence.\nExactly. I’m 5’11”, so when I wear heels, it’s definitely a really good view that I have. I’m like 6’2 when I wear heels, so I tend to wear cowboy boots a lot.\n\nGoing back a few years, since you’re such a veteran in many aspects of this, even at 17: You had your first songwriting deal at 14, and you had an RCA development deal before that at 13?\nYou did your research! That’s exciting. Yeah, I did.\n\nSo does that mean everyone was thinking you were going to make a record at 13?\nI was hoping for it. A development deal is where they’re giving you recording time and money to record, but not promising that they’ll put an album out. And they can kind of shelve you, in some circumstances. After a year of development, we just decided that we wanted to look around, so we walked. And it’s not a really popular thing to do in Nashville, to walk away from a major record deal. But that’s what I did, because I wanted to find some place that would really put a lot of time and care into this. And it ended up being a record label that wasn’t even in existence yet: Big Machine Records happened, and then got major-label distribution with Universal, and things have gone pretty well since then.\n\nWalking away from that first label, was that because of the material you thought you would be asked to record? You were so new to songwriting, I’m assuming that, at age 13, you weren’t necessarily thinking you had to do all your own songs.\nActually, I’ve been writing since I was 12, so I had so many songs I wanted people to hear. It was a combination of things, why I left, [but mostly] just because I did not want to be on a record label that wanted me to cut other people’s stuff. That wasn’t where I wanted to be.\n\nAnd you knew that at 13 or 14?\nI did, and it was something that I wanted to be addressed. I didn’t want to just be another girl singer. I wanted there to be something that set me apart. And I knew that had to be my writing. Also, it was a big, big record label with big superstars, and I felt like I needed my own direction and the kind of attention that a little label will give you. I just did not want it to happen with the method of ”Let’s throw this up against the wall and see if it sticks, and if it doesn’t, we’ll just walk away.” I wanted a record label that needed me, that absolutely was counting on me to succeed. I love that pressure.\n\nNEXT PAGE: ”When I turn 18, I may do something crazy, like go out and vote or something”\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: You’ve said you’ve written or cowritten about 200 songs. Looking back on those songs you wrote at 13 or 14, do you think ”Wow, those were immature,” or were there actually some good ones?\nTAYLOR SWIFT: Of course there are the songs where I’m like, ”Wow, that was in my experimental stage.” But then there are other songs where I go back and I’m like, ”Well, I could change this, but that melody’s really cool.” I actually put a song on the album that I wrote when I was 12, and it’s called ”The Outside.” It’s about what I was going through at the time. I was a complete outcast at school and never fit in, never felt like I belonged. A lot of times back then when I was 12 or 13, I would write songs about relationships, when I wasn’t in relationships, because I would look at other people and try to observe what they were going through. But in the case of ”The Outside,” I was writing exactly what I saw. I was writing from pain. And I’ve always felt so lucky, because I’ve never needed an escape like drinking or drugs or anything like that to escape from the bad days. Music has always been that escape for me.\n\nAre all the songs on this album that autobiographical, or were some written in that early spirit of youthful conjecture?\nThere’s one on the album called ”Tied Togerher With a Smile” that I wrote about one of my friends, who is this beauty queen, pageant princess — a gorgeous, popular girl in high school. Every guy wanted to be with her, every girl wanted to be her. I wrote that song the day I found out she had an eating disorder. There are a couple songs on the album like that, that are just watching other people and making observations. But most of the songs on the album are about actual people that have been in my life. I tend to be kind of blatantly obvious, and with my songs, I’ll even mention names a lot of times.\n\nYou use real names, and I’m sure even without names, people can figure out it’s them.\nOh, definitely. The funny thing is, there are so many people in the town where I live, Hendersonville [outside of Nashville], that think they do have a song written about ’em. You go out into this big world and you go on tour with all these people, and you go back and it’s still a small town and they still gossip about it. I think it’s one of everybody’s favorite things to talk about — who my songs are written about. [Laughs] There are definitely a few more people who think that I’ve written songs about them than there actually are.\n\nThere are so few singers of your age making it in country. In the pop world, it’s more common for girls your age to have a success — but you always sense they’re just chafing against the limits of propriety until they turn 18, and then the minute they do they’ll start competing with the Pussycat Dolls like everybody else.\nWhen I turn 18, I may do something crazy, like go out and vote or something. [Laughs] I’m just really more of a laid-back person. I’ve never been a party girl. I’d rather write a song about something or rather be doing something to further my career. I know that sounds like I’m a robot, but I honestly love this. Yesterday, I did five hours of radio remotes, which is where you walk around to all the different radio stations and you’re interviewed by everybody. And I honestly love that. That was the most fun part of my day yesterday. And I guess a lot of people don’t like that, but for me, I’ve just never been into going to parties as much as I’ve been into doing this. I guess I got used to having to make that choice when I was little. Because, you know, popular girls in school start partying when they’re like 12. And I had to choose between being popular or not messing my life up. So I think making that choice has kind of made a permanent mark on me to be responsible. Also, when you put out a single, whether you like it or not, you’re a role model, so you have to accept that.\n\nSo you don’t try to dispel the role-model thing or put that out of your mind?\nNo. When I’m about to make decisions, my point of reference is the 6-year-old girl in the front row of my concert. I think about what she would think if she saw me do what I was considering doing. Then I go back and I think about her mom and what her mom would think if I did that.\n\nNEXT PAGE: ”Don’t ask. I just am a Def Leppard freak”\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: How do you feel about your age being an angle in your success?\nTAYLOR SWIFT: I’ve never wanted to use my age as a gimmick, as something that would get me ahead of other people. I’ve wanted the music to do that. So we’ve never hidden the fact that I’m 17, but we’ve never wanted it to be the headline. Because I want the music to win. I think the actual truth of the matter is that being 17 has been sort of an obstacle, just in proving yourself to radio and proving yourself to middle-aged people listening to the radio. It’s just a number on my birth certificate. But I’m very respectful of that number, you know?\n\nIf you look at the research that the country radio format compiles, a lot of it says that the core listeners are older women — and these older women mainly want to hear male singers. Does that mean the older female audience for country has accepted you, or you’ve brought in a younger audience?\nI think there’s a little bit of both. In addressing the stereotype that middle-aged women want to hear male voices: I think they want to hear female voices too, but they want to hear female voices singing songs that they believe. But I think one of the cool things about this is that MySpace is one of the main reasons I’m here, along with radio and and word of mouth. And MySpace is pretty much a younger thing, at the moment. We just crossed over like 14 million plays on my MySpace page since June of last year. So yeah, definitely, it’s bringing a completely different audience to country music. And I am so grateful for that. I don’t know what I did to make that happen, because everybody was talking about it. I would go to CRS [Country Radio Seminar] before I was ever signed to a record deal, and I would listen to people say, ”Someone needs to bring in that younger demographic.” And what I’m hearing is that we’ve done that, and we kind of stumbled upon it. I wasn’t trying to be exclusive as to who would like it.\n\nWhen you had the song ”Tim McGraw,” I thought, well, maybe older women can listen to that and think it refers to remembering a song off Tim McGraw’s first album, as opposed to one off the last one, ”Can’t Tell Me Nothing,” which is what really inspired you.\n[Laughs] I think the reason why ”Tim McGraw” worked out was it was reminiscent, and it was thinking about a relationship that you had and then lost. I think one of the most powerful human emotions is what should have been and wasn’t. I think everyone can relate to that. That was a really good first song to start out on, just because a lot of people can relate to wanting what you can’t have.\n\nI was reading that one of your faves is Def Leppard.\nI love Def Leppard so much. If I ever did [an episode of] Crossroads — like CMT does Crossroads with a rock band and a country singer — that would be my choice, probably. Don’t ask. I just am a Def Leppard freak.\n\nMaybe you could seek out their old producer, Mutt Lange, to produce you, since all the Shania records he does sound like theirs.\nI loved her records. But that’s a completely different kind of thing than my music is. I’m really more acoustic-based. And yeah, some of the songs will have guitar licks that are more rock-based or whatever, and will have hints of all the music that I’ve been influenced by. But we try to keep a really strong acoustic base to my music.\n\nYou’re on the road with Brad Paisley till November. He’s a notorious prankster, so I’m guessing there are some fun and games on the tour.\nWe pranked him first, all the opening acts. You can go on MySpace and watch it. You know how his single is called ”Ticks”? I went online and I ordered these giant tick costumes — like big, giant sumo-wrestler-looking tick costumes — and me and Kellie [Pickler] dressed up in them and ran out on stage and started dancing all around him. And then Jack Ingram, the other opening act, came out in this white exterminator suit halfway through the song, with a sprayer, and proceeded to kill us on stage.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Singer Taylor Swift finds quick success in country music world\nAnna Ferguson Aug 10, 2007 Updated Jan 25, 2016 \n\nTaylor Swift isn't one to take life, or herself, too seriously. She readily makes jokes about her larger-than-life curly hair and she's overjoyed to dress up in a tick costume and jump on stage with tour-mate Brad Paisley to poke fun at his current country hit, \"Ticks.\"\n\n\"Oh my gosh, we are always playing jokes on each other,\" Swift said in a recent phone interview. \"Pranks are how we entertain ourselves. I love to be goofy.\"\n\nLess funny is Swift's rise in the music world, which has been serious business. Her self-titled album, featuring hit singles \"Tim McGraw\" and \"Tear Drops on My Guitar,\" recently hit No. 1 on Billboard's country charts, and went platinum after only 32 weeks. Swift is the only country artist ranked in the top 15 on Billboard's all-genre Top 200 chart, and she is the third best-selling artist this year, behind Carrie Underwood and, ironically, Tim McGraw.\n\nIf all that weren't enough, Swift has the honor of being the first female solo artist in country music history to write or co-write every song on a million-selling debut.\n\nDespite these accolades, the 17-year-old is reluctant to call herself successful, and she downright refuses to be labeled as famous.\n\n\"If there is one thing I've learned in the three years I've been in this business, it's to never call yourself famous,\" Swift said. \"Once you're famous, you can't be a normal person. People look at you differently. I always have my mom here to tell me if I get a big head and say stop being a jerk. I want to be as normal as possible.\"\n\nHaving been on tour constantly for the last two years, it hasn't been easy to maintain a normal lifestyle, though. Swift is finishing her senior year of high school on the road, and she isn't planning to go to a traditional college, opting instead for online classes.\n\nShe can't go hang out with her friends, go to movies on the weekends or go to the mall for a random shopping spree. When she is afforded the rare occasion of being home in Hendersonville, Tenn., though, Swift feels worlds away from the rush of touring.\n\n\"My hometown is pretty small, and it feels removed from Music Row and Nashville and all of this,\" she said. \"That's exactly what I want when I am home. I'm on tour, like, 24/7, which is great. But when I'm home, I just want to relax.\"\n\nAt the ripe age of 10, Swift heard the distinct call of the music world. She knew that one day she would be on stage, in the spotlight. After dragging her parents to every fair, festival and karaoke contest she could find, Swift began writing her own music at 12 years old. By age 14, she had landed a record deal and has been cranking out material since.\n\n\"Three years ago, all this seemed so out of reach. Here I am, just this young girl with dreams and big hair. I can't believe I'm here now,\" Swift said. \"I can't explain just how grateful I am to all my fans and all the people who went out and bought my CD. I really, really like having this platinum record on my wall, and I can't thank my fans enough.\"\n\nSwift will headline the Simon DTour Live concert held from noon to 6 p.m. today at the Mall of Georgia, 3333 Buford Drive, Buford.\n\n",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Proves Her Staying Power\n\nAugust 23, 2007 — Taylor Swift's self-titled debut disc remains atop the Billboard country album chart for a fifth big week.\n\nWith that feat, Taylor becomes the only country artist in 2007 to spend five consecutive weeks at No. 1, putting her in the company of superstars Carrie Underwood, Rascal Flatts and the Dixie Chicks, all of whom logged five or more consecutive weeks at the top in 2006.\n\nThe album reached the top of the country sales chart in its 39th week in stores, an achievement reminiscent of the Dixie Chicks' 51-week climb to No. 1 in 1999 with their debut CD, Wide Open Spaces.\n\nEarlier this summer Taylor secured her place in country music history as the only female solo artist in country music history to write or co-write every song on a platinum-selling debut. The album has also passed the 23 million mark for music streams on her MySpace page.\n\nThe third single from the album, \"Our Song,\" will ship to radio next week. \"I'm so glad this song is a single,\" Taylor says. \"When we were picking songs for the album, I stood by this one and made sure it got recorded. I just knew there was something about it.\"\n\nTaylor says she's especially excited about the song because she wrote it by herself without any co-writers. \"Like 'Tim McGraw,' the song was finished in like 20 minutes,\" she says. \"I wrote it about this guy I was dating, and how we didn't have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one. I think there's just some sort of magic in the way the track sounds like it's bouncing, almost!\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript]  Swift road to success \nFor someone who is only 17, Taylor Swift's drive and maturity has produced remarkable career, writes. PATRICK LANGSTON \nOttawan Citizen \n\nAsked how much time she has to talk, Taylor Swift answers without a pause, \"Ten minutes.\" She sounds more like a friendly but efficient executive on the rise than a 17-year-old country music artist. And it's immediately clear that Swift's own focused determination, not just some giant marketing machine, is behind her success: a publishing contract at 1, a self-titled debut album that went gold within three months of being released last year, a debut single, Tim McGraw, that shot into the country chart Top 5: opening slots on the Brad Paisley tour, which comes to Scotiabank Place this Friday, and the George Strait tour earlier this year. Swift, talking by cellphone, has just stepped off the plane in Allentown, Pennsylvania, from Nashville and is ea- ger to get home (she still lives with her parents in nearby Wyomissing, Pennsyl vania, her hometown).\nShe says that her drive comes from her parents, both of whom have high- powered business backgrounds.\n\"My mum decided to stay home to raise me. She totally raised me to be log- ical and practical. I was brought up with such a strong woman in my life and I think that had a lot to do with me not wanting to do anything half-way.\"\nHer father was a stockbroker, she adds, \"Business-wise, he's brilliant. I'm constantly getting business advice and what to invest in. I think you should be in charge of every single aspect of your career.\"\nSomehow you know that's exactly what Swift will do.\nOf course, you can't very well be all business and succeed as a singer/song- writer in country music, the original heart-on-the-sleeve genre.\nSwift's songs she's written about 200 of them since the age of 12 - are mostly about love. And, being smart, she writes about what she knows: teenage love. Crushes, a cheating boyfriend, sneaking out of the house for a ren- dezvous are the stuff of her bright, coun- try-pop songs.\nSwift's album also includes tune about loneliness called The Outside. One of her first compositions, it sprang from being an outcast at school.\n\"On weekends, I was going to festi- vals and fairs and karaoke contests to play my guitar in front of people, and my friends were always going to parties. For me, it was not being a part of that because of what I wanted to do with my life. Now when I look back, I'm so glad I wasn't doing bad things.\" No longer the outsider, she says her Allentown concerts these days sell out in an hour.\nThe hardest part of songwriting for Swift is waiting to perform it for the first time.\n\"You think it's amazing. You totally get what you're saying, but it's the most vulnerable state right before you play it for someone else.\"\nA confessed perfectionist, she'll spends days editing a tune. \"I'm totally like that. With school, I was always a perfectionist and an overachiever.\"\nSwift's parents have always sup- ported her overachieving ways.\nWhen she was 12, they moved the family to Hendersonville, outside Nashville, so she could pursue music. By 14, Swift was the youngest song- writer ever signed to Sony Publishing. At 16, and having already walked away from an unadvantageous development deal with RCA, she was one of the first artists signed to a new record label, Big Machine Records, after label owner Scott Borchetta spotted her during a showcase at Nashville's legendary Blue Bird Café.\nSince then, she's not only sold a slew of records but also performed Tim McGraw, a clever break-up song, at the Academy of Country Music Awards in Los Angeles this past May, where she was an award nominee.\nMore recently, she was nominated for a Horizon Award for new artists at this November's Country Music Associa tion Awards in Nashville.\nShe also starred this past season in a reality miniseries on cable television's Great American Country.\nThe camera tracked Swift during her senior year of high school as she mor- phed from just another student into a country music star.\nSwift has always, so to speak, stood out. Thin and energetic, she's five feet 11 inches tall, which becomes six-two when she dons cowboy boots.\n\"Everybody thought I'd be good at basketball,\" she says, \"but then I tried out and it was, like, 'Oh.' I was awful at\nanything that's sports.\"\nShe is, however, getting good at yoga. It's one of the things she's incorporated into her band's schedule as a way of staying limber and controlling stress while on the road.\n(She's also getting good at bending the rules: her Citizen interview ran more than the allotted 10 minutes.)\nBarely out of high school and just revving up her career, Swift may be a long way from having her own family. But that doesn't mean she hasn't already done some advance thinking about it.\n\"I promised myself for the first 15 years as a mother and wife, I would not live in a mansion,\" she says. \"I was raised on a little farm and for me when I was little, it was the biggest place in the world. And it was the most magical, wonderful place in the world.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Blonde Ambition\nTaylor Swift has a platinum album, award nominations, and another hit song, all before she turns 18-and she's ready for more!\nStory by Chris Neal; Photo by Chris Hollo\n\nIt's not so unusual - an artist has just written a new song and wants to try it out on a captive audience. A positive reaction means that it might just have hits potential. Except that when Taylor Swift performed \"Our Song\" in the public for the first time, she was a ninth-grader taking part in her freshman talent show. Nonetheless, she got the reaction that she was hoping for.\n\"Months later,  people would still be coming up to me and singing it,\" remembers Taylor, calling from a tour stop in Alberta, Canada. \"I thought, \"You know what? They've only heard this once, so there's must be something to this song.\"\nThe kids who got \"Our Song\" stuck in their heads aren't alone anymore-three years later, the tune has become the third hit from her platinum self-titles album. A song penned when Taylor was just entering her teenege years (inspired by the same then-boyfriend about whom she wrote her debut single, \"Tim McGraw\") is now a hit just  as she's about to turn 18 on Dec. 13. She's not terribly concerned about convincing the public to begin thinking of her as an adult.\n\"I'm not gonna go, \"I want to see you me as a woman now!\"\" she say with a chuckle. \"People can think about me any way they want to--as long as they think of me.\"\nTaylor is planning her 18th birthday bash at a Nashville nightclub. \"Oh my gosh, I'm so excited!\" she confides. \"I can't wait. I've never really had a big birthday party before. I'm going to have all my friends there, and everybody that's been so good to me in the business, and we'll all just hang out.\"\n\nDecember is also an important month because that's when Taylor will begin recording her second album. \"I have 30 songs that I want to put on it, which is a little bit difficult because I can only put on 12,\" she says. \"I'm real excited for people to hear the new stuff.\"\nEven Taylor's life has changed completely since the release of her first album, she has no worries about fans being able to relate to her new songs just as they did to the tunes of \"Taylor Swift\"- songs she wrote when she was just an average high-schooler, albeit an exceptionally talented, ambitious and driven one.\n\"Once you've felt the emotion of being lied to or breaking up with somebody or falling in love, you can always go back and revisit those emotions and write songs about them,\" figures Taylor, who's far too busy these days for dating. \"You never stop feeling those things. You just layer them with other feelings.\"\nWhile waiting for Taylor's second album, fans can check out Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Collection, a holiday EP available only at Target stores. Among the six tracks are two new songs--one written when Taylor was 13 and one penned recently-- and four versions of seasonal classics. \"My favorite is Silent Night,\" which I reworked completely,\" she notes. \"I took the lyrics and created an entirely new melody. It's like you've heard it before, but you haven't.\"\nAlso in stores now is The Taylor Swift Limited Deluxe Edition, which combines an expanded version of her first album with a DVD inlcuding videos, live performances and home video footage edited by Taylor herself on her home computer. The CD includes three new songs (\"I'm Only Me When I'm With You,\" \"Invisible\" and  \"A Perfectly Good Heart\"), plus a recording of Taylor's first-ever phone conversation with the namesake of her debut hit, Tim McGraw.\n\"The first time I talked to him, I jokingly asked if I could go out on tour with him,\" she recalls with a chuckle. \"I didn't think that would be a possibility at all. I thought he'd just be like, \"Oh yeah, whatever.\"\" But a couple of weeks later, she was indeed invited to open several shows on Tim's 2007 summer tour with wife Faith Hill.\nThat's how things have been going on for Taylor lately- her fondest wishes have been coming true at an alarming rate. She recentlywon the Nashville Songwriters Association International's prestigious Songwriter/Artist of the Year award, and earned nominations at the American Music Awards and the recent Country Music Association Awards. (Turn to our CMA Awards coverage on pages 36-40 to discover how she fared there.)\n\"The reason I'm so excited about all this is because I never expected to actually happen,\" she says. \"When I was 10 years old, I'd lie awake at night and think about the roaring  crowd and walking  out on stage and that light  hitting me for the first time. But I was always very calculated about it. I would think about exactly how I was going to get there, not just how it would feel to be there.\"\nNow that she's there, she intends to stay- and she doesn't mind working hard to make  sure that happens. She just finished up several months opening for Brad Paisley's hit  Bonfire & Amplifiers Tour while playing shows on her own nights off. After working on her sophomore album throughout December., she'll spend the first three months of 2008 touring colleges nationwide. \"I don't feel the desire to rest now,\" she says. \"I'm lucky enough to have all this going well, so I want to go out there and play for people. Give me a couple of days off a month and I'm good. More than that, and I just feel like I'm being lazy.\"\nAll the effort, she admits, is well worth it to mantain and tighten the connection she shares with herever-growing audience. \"There are times when everybody in the arena is just screaming,\" she says, \"and I'm thinking, \"This is exactly why I wanted to do this.\"\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "11 Questions With Taylor Swift\n\nAt the ripe old age of 17, Taylor Swift is already in the country music history books. She's the only female solo artist ever to write or co-write every song on a platinum-selling debut album. And though the songwriting prodigy is hard at work on her second album, she isn't quite ready to put the CD that's earned her numerous accolades to rest. Swift recently sat down with us to talk about beefing up her eponymous debut. And in true teenage fashion, we also gab about boys, high school drama and how she helped her buddy Kellie Pickler through a tough breakup.\n\nTell us what's included on the new 'Taylor Swift [Deluxe Edition]' project.\n\nThe album has been out for a year, but it's too early to put out the second studio album. But we wanted to give [the fans] more music. So this was an opportunity to put out three new songs and a bunch of exclusive content. I actually edited a home movie on my laptop, and it's on there as a special feature. There's my first phone conversation with Tim McGraw, all my music videos and a bunch of concert footage. The [new] songs are demos that I wrote when I was 15, trying to get a record deal.\n\nIs there a true story behind your current single, 'Our Song'?\n\nI wrote this song in my freshman year of high school for my ninth grade talent show. I was sitting there thinking, \"I've gotta write an upbeat song that's gonna relate to everyone.\" And at that time, I was dating a guy and we didn't have a song. So I wrote us one, and I played it at the show. Months later, people would come up to me and say, \"I loved that song that you played.\" And then they'd start singing lines of it back to me. They'd only heard it once, so I thought, \"There must be something here!\"\n\nYou've toured with some notorious pranksters, namely Rascal Flatts and Brad Paisley. What's the funniest joke that's been played on you?\n\nBrad Paisley hasn't pranked me yet ... because he's afraid of me. [laughs] But Rascal Flatts had all of their crew take fold-out chairs and just sit on the stage during my performance. So there were eight guys, just sitting on stage reading the newspaper. And I'm playing right next to their faces, kinda hamming it up, trying to intimidate them. And I look in the newspapers they're reading, and there are Chippendales models in the newspapers! [laughs]\n\nWe hear you wrote a song with Kellie Pickler for her next album.\n\nKellie came on my bus this summer and was all upset about her ex-boyfriend. She was like, \"I just want to be over this!\" And she gets up on stage now and tells everyone all about it. She's like [imitating Kellie], \"He went out and got some other girl pregnant!\" [laughs] And I'm like, \"OK, if you want to tell everyone your personal stuff, but there's no better way to get over something than to write it all down.\" So we went into the back bedroom of my tour bus and wrote this awesome song. It's about how, for the rest of his life, he's going to regret cheating on her. And she's said to me since then, \"You know what, I didn't think there was anything I could do to really get past that. But writing that song gave me complete closure.\"\n\nIs there anything you miss about high school?\n\nI don't think there's really anything I miss, to be honest. There's a lot less drama when you're touring the country on a major tour. And I've actually been to prom before ... twice. So I don't want anyone to feel bad for me. It was really great that I got to experience those first two years of high school, and I'll never forget that. I learned a lot. But I feel like I've had the best senior year ever.\n\nHow would you say your young age has helped you and how has it hurt you in the music business?\n\nI think my age has helped me, because I can write about things I'm going through and girls my age can automatically relate. And I think [my age] has hurt me, because in the beginning, people were like, \"Teenagers and country music? No way!\" And I had interviewers who were dead-set on trying to get me to feel bad about how old I was. But you have to stand by who you are. I am 17-year-old girl, and I'm not ashamed of that. Age should not limit what you can accomplish.\n\nIs there a special guy in your life?\n\nI'm completely single! I think that love is something that hits you when you're not looking for it. So I've been actively not looking for it for like two years. [laughs] I'm always the third wheel on my friends' dates. I have a bunch of best friends who never go more than a month without having a boyfriend. And I think that's kinda rubbed off on me, because I've seen the stuff they've gone through over the past two years. And I'm just like, \"I'm gonna pursue my career instead.\"\n\nGarth Brooks has said that you are one of his daughters' favorite singers. Is that surreal to hear that a living legend is familiar with your music?\n\nHe is a living legend! And if you asked me who my hero is, I'd say Garth Brooks. I've met Garth's girls, they're wonderful. They came out to one of my shows. And it's just so unbelievable to see someone like Garth Brooks have kids who like my music. I'm like, \"Are you kidding me? Your dad is Garth Brooks!\" It's the coolest feeling ever.\n\nDo you have any other famous fans?\n\nI was at the ACM Awards, and Emma Roberts came up to me backstage. She was like, \"I just have to let you know, I'm announcing you tonight. And I'm a really big fan.\" And I was like, \"Oh my gosh, I'm going to see your movie this weekend!\" It was really cool. She's a sweetheart.\n\nUnlike a lot of other teen celebrities, you have managed to keep out of trouble. How do you resist temptation?\n\nYou have to surround yourself with good people who will tell you the things that maybe you don't want to hear -- the things you need to know to not do. I feel like I have an obligation to be responsible. I have a million people who went out and bought my album. Who knows how many of them were young girls? And I always think about the ten year old girl in the front row at my concert before I make a decision. \"What would she think if she saw me do this? Would this affect her choices?\"\n\nOut of all the milestones you've hit this year -- platinum sales, 8 weeks at No.1 on the country album charts, a CMT award, a CMA nomination -- what's been the highlight of your career?\n\nThe highlight of my career so far has been winning the CMT Breakthrough Video of the Year award. It's a fan-voted awards show, so I don't see any greater honor than winning an award that was voted on by fans. It was for my first video that I ever put out ['Tim McGraw'], and I'll never forget the feeling of just running ... bolting up to that stage. It was just the most amazing feeling.",

There's no blueprint for success, and sometimes you just have to work at it. You should make sure that you know who you are as an artist and make sure it's nothing like everyone else. It's good to be inspired by other artists, but you should always make sure that you've got your own niche.\"\n\nAnswering these questions from fans, she talks about learning dance moves from Kellie Pickler, the song that inspired \"Tim McGraw\" and why she's going to skip college.\n\n1. Who influenced you and why did you choose to make country music?\n\nI was influenced early on by all of the great female country artists of the '90s and all of the cool music they were putting out. Like Shania, Faith, the Dixie Chicks. It was such great music, and it completely drew me in to country music.\n\n2. If you could record a duet with any country music star, who would it be?\n\nI think Kenny Chesney or Garth Brooks would be the coolest duet partners. I look up to them so much for their work ethics. I was lucky enough to open up for Kenny on some shows this summer, and watching him work was so inspiring. He and Garth just represent true artists to me, and any project I could work with one of them would be an honor.\n\n3. If you could tour with all women, which artists or bands of any genre would you like to go on the road with you?\n\nWow, out of all genres I would pick Rihanna and Brandi Carlile. You say \"random.\" I say \"interesting.\"\n\n4. When you are not touring, what do you like to do for fun?\n\nMy best friend, Abigail, and I like to drive past our ex-boyfriends' houses.\n\n5. What did you remember the most about the night you filmed Brad Paisley's video, \"Online\"?\n\nI remember looking over at Kellie the whole time, trying to copy her dance moves. I'll admit it: That girl can dance!\n\n6. It's so fun to see you come out on stage singing an Eminem cover and your version of Beyonce's \"Irreplaceable\" rocks. Any plans to do a duet with a rap artist on an upcoming album?\n\nHa ha! I don't know! I'm not planning anything like that right now, but I think the coolest thing in the world would be to do something with Jay-Z. When I was 11, I sang the national anthem at a 76ers game in Philly. Jay-Z was sitting courtside and gave me a high-five after I sang. I bragged about that for like a year straight. I love doing cover songs that nobody expects. When I went to live shows, I always loved stuff like that. I like it when something you wouldn't expect to happen onstage happens -- musically or visually. I think Sugarland does a great job of incorporating different surprises into their shows.\n\n7. I love to sing but have a big problem with stage fright. Do you have any advice for me to conquer this problem?\n\nI think everyone has that problem when they first start singing. In my opinion, the only way to conquer stage fright is to get up on stage and play. Every time you play another show, it gets better and better. I started singing in front of crowds when I was 10, and it was a little scary at first. Anything you've just started doing is going to be scary. Once, somebody told me to picture the audience in their underpants. Do not picture the audience in their underpants. That does not work. At all.\n\n8. How has your home schooling experience helped or hindered your musical development?\n\nMy home schooling has been a great experience. I feel like I've had the best senior year possible. It's awesome that I've been able to stay on the same path to graduating that I would've been on if I'd stayed in high school. I'm going to graduate this year, and I'm so excited about that. My education was always a big deal to me, and I'm so glad home schooling allowed me to keep it up.\n\n9. Do you feel like you miss the so called normal life of a teenager?\n\nI don't, really. Of course, you're always going to wonder about the road not taken, the dorm not taken and the sorority not taken. But if I wasn't doing this, I would've missed out on the best moments I've ever known and the most wonderful life that I still can't believe I get to live. I'm still friends with the same people I was friends with in high school, and I feel like I haven't changed as a person.\n\n10. Do you plan on attending college?\n\nRight now, I'm pursuing my career. I always thought that I would go to college, most definitely. But then I really thought about it and assessed the situation, and I can't leave this life. Going to college would mean saying goodbye to my music career, and I just can't do that. There just wouldn't be enough time in the day to be on tour, do interviews, meet-and-greets, TV appearances and everything else that I need to do and go to college. Maybe later on in life I'll end up taking a few classes or doing it online. But right now, it just isn't where I need to be.\n\n11. I absolutely love your outfits. Where do you shop?\n\nThank you! I love to shop. One of the things I love about doing this is that you can shop for every season, because you know that sooner or later you're going to be in every part of the country and in every type of weather. I love Forever 21 and BCBG. Those are probably my favorite stores.\n\n12. I know you wear dresses a lot, so I was wondering if you would ever want to have your own dress line. I would definitely buy them.\n\nI love dresses, and I've definitely thought about designing them someday. I just want to make sure that I wait until the time is perfect and I can do it right. My stylist, Sandi Spika, makes my dresses for award shows and videos. We have so much fun planning the next big dress to make. I think it would be great to work with her on some cool dresses for a line.\n\n13. What kind of TV shows and movies do you like to watch?\n\nI love CSI: Las Vegas and Grey's Anatomy. I've come to the conclusion that the guy I end up with will remind me of the character Denny Duquette from Grey's. Ha ha. My favorite movie is Love Actually. It's got the cutest ending.\n\n14. Is the song \"Tim McGraw\" about a specific Tim McGraw song you danced to?\n\nIt's called \"Can't Tell Me Nothin'\" -- and it's my favorite Tim song.\n\n15. What do you do for inspiration when you sit down to write a song and it seems that nothing wants to come out?\n\nThat happens all the time. What I do is just put the guitar down and wait for something to hit me. You can never push songwriting. It happens or it doesn't.\n\n16. Do you also want to write songs for other artists?\n\nYes! Kellie Pickler and I wrote a song together when we were out on the road, and it was so cool jumping into someone else's feelings for a minute and writing from their perspective. It was like I was writing my very first song. Exhilarating.\n\n17. You are such an inspiration and role model to all girls of any age, and I think that's awesome! How do you manage to stay away from all the bad things superstars seem to be getting pulled into these days?\n\nI think it all comes down to who you surround yourself with and how strong your morals are. Before I make a decision, I stop and think about the 10-year-old girl I saw last night at my concert in the front row. I think about her mom. I think about how they bought my CD, thinking that I'm a good role model. Then I think about how they would feel if I did something to let them down. I can't imagine a greater pain than letting one of those mothers down. I honestly can't.\n\n18. If you were driving cross-country and could only bring one CD, what would it be?\n\nDef Leppard. Pyromania.\n\n19. From performing in front of thousands of fans to daily interviews and signing autographs, how do you keep up your energy?\n\nI'm 17. I think that helps a lot. I'm lucky to have been able to do all of this at a young age. Also, I'm just so consumed by it. I'm just so fascinated by every aspect of this. Whether it's radio or videos or concerts, I never want to stop getting excited. I hope I never do.\n\n20. Do you have any pets?\n\nI have a cat named Indi (who hates everyone in my family except for me) and two Dobermans. They're really sweet, but if you break in, they will eat you.",

But she began it alone at the computer with a quiet purpose – registering to vote.\n\n\"I did it online in my pajamas!\" the country-music star told PEOPLE later that night at her birthday party, hosted by her parents Andrea and Scott, at the popular Nashville nightspot Lot 7.\n\nSwift spent much of the day with close pals from high school, doing her hair and nails and selecting a short hot-pink Betsey Johnson dress for the party. \"It was between this and a black dress,\" she told PEOPLE, \"but I knew all my friends would be in black, so I went with the pink. I love pink!\"\n\nScott Borchetta, president of Swift's label, Big Machine Records, must have known that about his starlet – giving her a super-size bubblegum-pink Chevy truck as a present. Swift was thrilled, though she added that her fans are the ones who really made her birthday wishes come true.\n\n\"What I really wanted for my birthday was a No. 1 record, and I got that, too!\" (Swift's third single, \"Our Song,\" jumped to the top of Billboard's Country Singles chart this week.)\n\nThe 200 guests at the party included Kellie Pickler, Chuck Wicks, Lady Antebellum and Big & Rich's John Rich, who led the crowd in singing \"Happy Birthday.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift, whose \"Our Song\" remains at No. 1 on Billboard's Top Country Songs chart for the fifth week in a row, doesn't buy into the notion that winning a Grammy Award is a curse for a country artist. Up for next month's Grammy Awards' all-genre Best New Artist category, the 18- year-old singer-songwriter says she's humbled to be recognized by the industry.\n\n\"People have come up to me and said this award is cursed, and I look at them like they are crazy,\" Taylor tells Dial-Global. \"Carrie Underwood won it last year and LeAnn Rimes won it in the last ten years, too. The fact that I get to represent country music in this category just takes my breath away.\"\n\nTaylor was so excited to be nominated that she went into a \"hugging spree\" during the press conference. \"I just couldn’t help it. The past year has been absolutely magical,\" says Taylor, who plans to shoot the music video for her next single, \"Picture To Burn,\" before the Grammys.\n\nA Grammy might well be in her future, because Taylor is certainly on a roll. With the five-week run of \"Our Song\" at No. 1, Taylor joins 12 female artists who have achieved such a feat since Billboard began tracking country singles in 1944. She's in the company of such artists as Carrie Underwood, Gretchen Wilson, Faith Hill, Martina McBride, Shania Twain, Dolly Parton and Patsy Cline.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift, Little Miss Perfect\n\"That’s Sam’s house, the one with the boat in the driveway. He’s the guy who made the unfortunate error of cheating on a songwriter. Big Mistake.”\n\nTaylor Swift, the extravagantly blond, improbably blue-eyed, intimidatingly leggy 18-year-old star is sitting in the driver’s seat of her Lexus SC430, idling outside a two-story house on a serene side street in her hometown of Hendersonville, Tennessee. Hendersonville is a suburb of 40,000 that stretches along the northern shoreline of scenic Old Hickory Lake, just outside Nashville. There are a couple of gaudy strips near the turnpike, packed with malls and chain restaurants, but in general, it’s a lovely, leafy place, with pretty homes set back from well-manicured lawns on pleasant little streets and culs-de-sac. A bit farther outside town, the landscape turns horse-country bucolic, and the houses get much, much bigger. Swift, who offered to show Blender around Hendersonville, has already piloted the Lexus past Roy Orbison’s old mansion and a sprawling compound that once belonged to Johnny Cash.\n\nNow, in the more middle-class section of town, we make the first stop on Taylor’s Hendersonville Boy Tour. We’re in front of Sam’s, the rake who prompted Swift to write the revenge ballad “Should’ve Said No,” one of the preternaturally catchy songs on her self-titled debut album. Not far away lives Drew, another ex, now off at ­college, who inspired two of Swift’s monster hits, her wistful debut single, “Tim McGraw,” about a thwarted summer romance between a couple who share the same favorite singer, and 2007’s No. 1 country smash “Our Song.” Swift pulls her car over. “I took my prom pictures in that backyard. I’ve totally moved on. Drew’s a great guy, but we’re not really in touch. His girlfriend”—Swift pauses for emphasis—“she’s not much of a Taylor Swift fan.”\n\nShe chuckles. “The cool thing about being a songwriter is, whatever you go through, you can write a song about it and turn it into something good for your career.”\n\nSome teenagers pour their hearts out in diaries or on their MySpace pages. Taylor Swift has a little MySpace page of her own, of course—it recently clicked past 39 million plays. But not many teens can justifiably refer to themselves in the third person, and fewer still immortalize their confessions and crushes in hit songs. She wrote or co-wrote all of her debut, and each track is melodic and witty in its description of homeroom crushes or sneaking out late with a boyfriend. Swift excels at the Drew Songs (sweetly sentimental) as well as the Sam Songs (spiked with venom). She’s the poet laureate of 10th-grade relationships, from first kisses to kiss-offs.\n\nHer debut, Taylor Swift, released by the upstart indie label Big Machine, has sold more than 2.5 million copies, thanks to an unmistakably Generation Y sound that mixes the admissions and complaints of emo—and even a little hip-hop swagger—with plucked banjos and sawing fiddles. She plays country, the last genre that actually sells records, but her songs also have pop appeal, and Universal Music, which distributes Big Machine, crossed over “Teardrops on My Guitar” and “Our Song” to Top 40 radio this winter.\n\nAlthough this five-foot-eleven teenager with a cute overbite looks like she should still be on the cheerleading squad, she’s not only proven her songwriting skills, she’s also honed a crack live show while opening for stars twice her age, including Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, Kenny Chesney and Brad Paisley.\n\nHer songs may have been born in high school hallways, but their dramatics also resound with adults. Brad Paisley tells Blender, “I was looking at a lot of artists to come out on tour with us, but as soon as I downloaded her album, I knew we had to have her. I was floored by the songwriting. I love the fact that she doesn’t pretend to be 30 years old in her songs. She has a very genuine voice.” In November, she won the CMA Horizon Award—Nashville’s official welcome-to-the-A-list prize—and in February she attended the Grammys, where she presented an award, was a nominee for Best New Artist and chatted up Timbaland and Flo Rida.\n\nIt’s safe to say there has never before been a teenage bombshell beloved by the big-hat crowd, with a penchant for acoustic Beyoncé and Rihanna covers and a habit of opening her concerts by rapping a few verses of Eminem’s “Lose Yourself.” While the record industry continues its slow-motion implosion—and the hitmaking princesses of a previous generation stagger from the nightclub to the rehab center—Swift is looking an awful lot like the perfect 21st-century pop star.\n\nBack in Hendersonville, Swift steers her car into the parking lot of the high school she attended for two years before she left to pursue her career full-time. “It’s so weird,” she says. “All these cars belong to my friends. They’re in class; I’m doing a magazine interview. Life is funny.”\n\nTaylor Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Eastern Pennsylvania, almost 800 miles north of the Grand Ole Opry. She grew up in Wyomissing and in Reading, where her family owned an 11-acre Christmas-tree farm as a secondary business. (Swift’s father, Scott, is a successful stockbroker.) She was always musical, but the eureka moment came when she was 6 and her mother brought home an album by LeAnn Rimes, a 13-year-old country phenom. An obsession was born. “I started listening to female country artists nonstop: Faith Hill, Shania Twain, Dixie Chicks. And they led me back to Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette,” she says. “I think it was the storytelling that really grabbed me.” The young Taylor got her first taste of live performance in a local children’s musical-theater company—she played Sandy in Grease and Maria in The Sound of Music—but the influence of her heroines had already seeped into her voice. “My singing sounded a lot more country than Broadway,” she recalls.\n\nSoon, Taylor got her first guitar, practicing “until my fingers bled or my mom called me to dinner.” On weekends, she dragged her parents to karaoke bars and open-mic nights. (Her play list included “Goodbye Earl,” the Dixie Chicks hit about an abused woman who gets murderous revenge.) She also began to write her own songs. And her fascination with country music made her an outcast. “She was shunned,” says her mother, Andrea. “After school, I’d hear what nightmare had occurred that day, what awful thing was done to her. I’d have to pick her up off the floor.” The second song Taylor wrote, when she was 12, was a schoolgirl’s plaint about social ostracism, “The Outside,” which made its way onto her album six years later. “I used to sit in the back of class and watch these people and their interactions and really wish that I could be included,” Swift says. “Part of it was that they were already starting to party at ages 12 and 13—and I was playing at singer-songwriter nights ­every weekend instead.”\n\nWhen she was 11, Taylor persuaded her mom to vacation in Nashville, the country-music mecca. “I had a demo CD of me singing karaoke music. We rented a car, and we would pull up in front of a label on Music Row and I’d walk in and talk to the receptionist: ‘Hi, I’m Taylor. I’m 11. I really want a record deal.’”\n\nThe receptionists didn’t sign her, but the trip whetted Taylor’s appetite. She began lobbying to relocate to Nashville.\n\nMost parents would view this as a child’s whim, an unrealistic passing ­fancy—­country stars aren’t born to Pennsylvania stockbrokers. Then her lobbying turned to begging and cajoling, and finally, in 2004, the family loaded up the truck and moved to Tennessee, like the Beverly Hillbillies in reverse. “My father had a job he could do from anywhere,” Swift says. “My parents moved across the country so I could pursue a dream.”\n\nThe rest is already the stuff of Nashville legend. At age 13, Taylor inked a development deal with RCA. The following year, she signed a songwriting contract with Sony/ATV Music Publishing, becoming perhaps the youngest professional tunesmith in Nashville history. In the mornings, Swift would trundle off to Hendersonville High, where she got straight A’s; in the afternoons, her mother would ferry her, soccer-mom style, to Music Row for her songwriting sessions. Swift teamed up with veteran songwriter Liz Rose, and the pair began churning out material. “My sessions with Taylor were some of the easiest I’ve ever done,” Rose says. “Basically, I was just her editor. She’d write about what happened to her in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she’d come in with some of the most incredible hooks.”\n\nRCA wasn’t so sure. A brief vogue for teen country singers—including Lila McCann, who sang adult love songs even though she wore braces—had peaked, which was probably inevitable in a genre that appeals primarily to women aged 24 to 35. Also, there hadn’t been a new female country star in years: Shania Twain had hidden herself away in a European castle, eating macrobiotic, while Reba McEntire ditched music for a network-TV series. Big Machine founder Scott Borchetta—a relentless, willful executive who’d been fired from Universal despite being the best promotion man in town—pounced after seeing Swift play a few numbers at a songwriter night. “He broke two rules,” says a Nashville executive. “Taylor was a teenager and she was female.”\n\nOne afternoon in 2005, Swift brought in a new ballad to play for Rose. The song—a gentle farewell to ex-boyfriend Drew—had a wistful, indelible melody. Even better, it had a surefire gimmick, name-checking one of the biggest country stars on Earth: “When you think Tim McGraw/I hope you think my favorite song/The one we danced to all night long.” There was no question what Swift’s lead single would be. In July 2006, “Tim McGraw” cracked the country Top 10. By the time she finally met her song’s namesake, on May 15, 2007—on live television, following a solo acoustic performance of the hit at the Academy of Country Music Awards—she could greet him as a fellow platinum-selling superstar.\n\nToday, Swift lives with her mom, dad and 16-year-old brother, Austin, in the same rambling McMansion they moved into when they arrived from Pennsylvania. One of her parents always travels with her on tour. Taylor legally became an adult last December, but she is in no hurry to leave the nest. “My parents are the coolest,” she exults. “My mother is so not a momager.”\n\nA visitor to the Swifts’ home would meet a group just like any other affluent suburban family, only far happier and more well-adjusted. There’s a music room, stocked with guitars, recording equipment and framed gold records and awards. But the house has not been turned into the Taylor Swift Hall of Fame and Museum, which may go a long way in explaining Swift’s diva-free affect. The only fancy toy she’s bought with her small fortune is the Lexus.\n\nShe recently went to a Nashville Predators hockey game with American Idol alums Carrie Underwood and Kellie Pickler. “It was really neat,” Pickler hoots. “Total blonde power. After the game, we pulled into a gas station and Carrie saw this guy talking to Taylor. We were like, This isn’t right! I said, ‘Get away from her, you old man. If you’re still around when we finish filling up with gas, we’ll make a hood ornament out of you!’”\n\nNights like that are rare: Swift prefers to spend what little free time she has with family or hanging out with her best friend, Abigail, a senior at Hendersonville High. Taylor is polite and articulate and funny and self-­deprecating—the only time she bristles is when she is reminded that she has occasionally been called “the country Britney Spears.” And who can blame her?\n\nIn fact, the only cause for concern is that Swift may be slightly too good, too  cautious—career-focused with such an unswerving sense of propriety that she is not acting her age. She confesses that she hasn’t kissed a boy since her album came out nearly two years ago (“I just don’t have the time”) and that she skips parties with her high school friends to avoid any underage scandal that may arise: “There could be drinking there or whatever. Your career could go up in smoke just like that. It’s not worth the risk.” What 18-year-old creates a world that consists entirely of work—and excludes the delights of dating, gossip and keg stands? When will repressed temptations cause her to break out in boils and hives and run naked across the tidy lawns of Hendersonville, calling the names of Sam and Drew?\n\nNot this month, certainly. She has partnered with Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen in a cause that could offend no one: combating Internet sex predators. (“It’s such an important issue,” Swift intones.) She says she plans to vote in November’s presidential election, but when asked if she’s a Democrat or a Republican, you can see the wheels turning, as she searches for the ideal inoffensive non-answer: “I don’t think I’m either.”\n\nSwift takes Blender out to lunch at a local Applebee’s—“You may as well get the full Hendersonville experience,” she quips—and is instantly thrust into press-the-flesh mode, patiently signing autographs for all the fans who flock to her table. This includes a ditzy waitress who at first fails to recognize her, then asks if anyone has ever told Taylor she looks like Faith Hill and finally suggests she consider a modeling career. Later today, Swift is scheduled to fly to Phoenix to sing at a corporate event for Procter & Gamble. “It’s going to be fun,” she chirps. “I love so many of their brands.”\n\nBritney Spears and Paris Hilton might roll their eyes at this naiveté, then hijack an SUV to the next Beverly Hills debauchery. But there is a large part of the U.S. that still prefers good behavior over bad. And in a country where blond female singers are the new gangsta rappers, Taylor appeals to moms who worry about their daughters having proper role models, and who’ll happily buy a pair of $28 tickets to spend a wholesome family night out and support an ideal.\n\nAfter lunch, Swift takes Blender for another drive and cues up a bunch of new demos, each catchier than the next: a tense rocker, cowritten with Kellie Pickler; a sweet folk-tinged song dedicated to BFF Abigail; an unreasonably hooky ’80s-style power ballad. (Swift declares herself “the biggest Def Leppard fan in the world.”) In late March, she’ll hit the road with country mega-hitmakers Rascal Flatts, popping into the studio in free moments to start her next album. “Taylor will be around a long time,” Brad Paisley predicts. “Her audience will grow with her.”\n\nIn the meantime, Swift can indulge her one apparent vice: schadenfreude. The liner notes to the deluxe edition of Taylor Swift include an epic list of thank-yous, followed by a taunting postscript: “To all the boys who thought they would be cool and break my heart, guess what? Here are 14 songs written about you. HA.” You can’t help but feel for the guy who inspired Swift’s latest single, “Picture to Burn,” where she nyah-nyahs, “So go and tell your friends that I’m obsessive and crazy/That’s fine, I’ll tell mine you’re gay.” Taylor’s Mean Girls moments are reminders that, despite her grown-up career and sylphine presence on the red carpet, she’s a teenager, just a few years removed from the daily humiliations at Wyomissing Area Junior High.\n\nSteering her Lexus down the winding road back to her house, she recounts a close encounter with another ex-boyfriend, the guy who inspired the hit heartbreak ballad “Teardrops on My Guitar.” “I was on my way out of the house to meet Carrie and Kellie for the hockey game,” she says. “He was standing there in my driveway. I haven’t talked to this guy in two years. I was like, ‘Um, hi?’” “It would have been really cool and poetic. She chuckles gently. if he had turned up at my house right after my album came out. But it was two years later. A couple of things had happened in my life since then. I was like, ‘It’s really great to see you. But you’re a little late.’”",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Complete Transcript] Taylor Swift: Date with Grammy?\nLike any typical teen, this high school senior has spent her fair share of time obsessing over boys. But turning heartbreak into top 10 hits? Anything but ordinary\n\nBy Chris Willman\n\nChris Willman is a senior music writer for Entertainment Weekly\n\nEW's editorial guidelines\nPublished on February 4, 2008 05:00AM EST\nImage\nPhoto: PHOTOGRAPH BY WILLIAMS + HIRAKAWA\n\nThe ”about me” section on Taylor Swift’s MySpace page is full of the sort of self-characterizations you’d expect from just about any 18-year-old girl: ”In my spare time, I like to drive past my ex-boyfriends’ houses and conduct random baking experiments in my kitchen…. I will never straighten my hair to impress a guy ever again…. I’ve never been the kind of girl who needs a boyfriend. I believe that love will find you when you’re not looking for it. So I’ve been actively not looking for it for about three years now. I’ll let you know how that works out for me. It probably doesn’t help that I write songs about every guy I talk to.”\n\nThese otherwise normal musings are, it turns out, also the stuff of which both confessional teen anthems and stardom are made. Scroll above her ”about me” — which reads like a prose teaser for her songs of wistful romance (”Our Song”), revenge (”Should’ve Said No”), and rejection (”The Outside”) — and you’ll find some not-so-average numbers: 28,422,020 profile views, 37,581,161 song streams, and 595,103 friends (at press time). But it’s not just the high school senior’s social-networking stats that are impressive. Country music’s newly minted superstar had her self-titled debut album rank among the top 10 sellers for 2007 in all genres; it’s sold 2.4 million and looks like a triple platinum shoo-in. Her first three singles have collectively been purchased another 2.7 million times. At the moment, she has smashes in two formats: ”Our Song” just finished a six-week run as the No. 1 country song, while ”Teardrops on My Guitar,” her first crossover hit, is in the top 10 on pop radio and still ascending. Country-shy MTV is even giving the video some test airings.\n\nOn top of all this, if Grammy voters decide they’d prefer a winner who’s likely to not only show up but be steady at the podium, Swift stands a decent chance of beating Amy Winehouse for the Best New Artist trophy on Feb. 10. And though this pretty pristine teen seems to be the embodiment of the anti-Amy, Swift and Winehouse have something else in common besides a nomination: Of all the singers who’ve become stars in the last couple of years, they’re the two who could be the ”career artists” the industry craves — self-possessed singer-songwriters with strong personal vision and the potential to still be galvanizing a mass audience two, three, maybe even 10 Grammy eligibility periods down the road.\n\n”I think songwriting is the ultimate form of being able to make anything that happens in your life productive,” she says, sitting in her favorite L.A. spot for quick-stop California cuisine, In-N-Out Burger. Leaning in over her double cheeseburger to fix you in her blue-eyed stare, she vouches for the veracity of her lyrics, all true-life tales from the front lines of adolescence. ”If you get out of a bad relationship that was a complete waste of your time and emotions, you can write a song about it and it can become a benefit to your career. How sweet is that?” About as sweet as the chocolate shake she’s using as a dipping sauce for her fries.\n\nNot that the 5’11” siren would want to defame any of the boys back home in Tennessee, but…”I don’t edit out names or personal details. I feel bad for guys a little, after I’ve written songs with their names in them, because they move on to different relationships and their new girlfriends are smacking them in the car when the song comes on.”\n\nSometimes they come back. ”Teardrops on My Guitar” is the quintessential unrequited-crush ballad, about being madly in love with that oblivious classmate who can’t stop telling you about his new girlfriend — the stuff of John Hughes movies, and of time eternal. The real ”Drew” who’s name-checked in the song, the one who supposedly couldn’t see her mooniness for the trees, showed up over the holidays, just as she was leaving her family’s house near Nashville to meet pals Carrie Underwood and Kellie Pickler at a hockey game. It wasn’t clear whether he hoped to make up for past myopias. ”My dad said, ‘Hey, there’s someone here to see you.’ And it was Drew, from ‘Teardrops.’ I hadn’t talked to him in three years, so it was…interesting. I was like. ‘Wow! Hi. You’re late.”’\n\nA lot of Swift’s songs might be getting back at somebody for past slights; in her liner notes, she writes, ”To all the boys who thought they would be cool and break my heart, guess what? Here are 14 songs written about you. HA.” But for Swift, revenge is a dish best served with warmth. There’s a playful sweetness even to her saddest and angriest songs — including her next single, ”Picture to Burn,” a truly gleeful comeuppance anthem (”I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive/You’re a redneck heartbreak who’s really bad at lying”). And at least a few of those 14 songs are really just romantic reveries, including her 2006-07 breakthrough hit ”Tim McGraw,” which is about hoping an old flame gets wistful every time ”your” song comes up in rotation, and the even bigger ”Our Song,” which describes a couple creating their own song, figuratively and literally. Those two were inspired by a ”cute little relationship” she had in ninth grade, just before moving from small-town Pennsylvania to Nashville — as opposed to the gnarlier tunes (like ”Should’ve Said No”) inspired by a Tennessee beau she refers to as ”Bad Cheater Guy.”\n\nNEXT PAGE: ”There’s heartache in her songs and her voice. It feels fresh, because the rawest heartbreak is probably the first heartbreak.”\n\nWhile her sentimental songs seem like natural hit fodder now, when her album debuted in late '06, Swift had two strikes against her. First, as she points out, \"Noteenager had worked [in a big way) in coun-try music since LeAnn Rimes, and that was 1996\" And female artists of any age have a tough time on country radio, where the core demo is females over 35 who the research insists want to hear from handsome me fantasy objects like George Strait and Keith Urban, not pretty young things who might steal\ntheir husbands' attention. But through the magic of MySpace, Swift managed to draw younger ears to the format-and then, to programmers surprise, she eventually won over that prickly mom demo, too.\n\"She's a teen, but there's no babblegum aspect to it,\" says Scott Borchetta, the founder and CEO of Swift's indie label, Big Machine. \"There's heartache in her songs and her voice. It feels fresh, because the rawest heartbreak is probably the first heartbreak I was talking to a program director at a key country station in Cleveland, who was struggling with play ing Teardrops. Then he played it for his wife and she was blown away. He asked her, \"How do you re late to this girl She said, \"I absolutely lived that in high school. Some people connect with Taylor's sorugs because they're rigst in that moment and sorte because they're nostalgic about it.\"\nOne track, \"The Outside,\" was written when Swift was a tunesmith all of 12. \"I wrote that about the scariest feeling I've ever felt going to school, walk-ing down the hall, looking at all those faces, and not knowing who you're gonna talk to that day. People always ask. How did you have the courage to walk up to record labels when you were 12 or 13? It's because I could never feel the kind of rejection in the music industry that I felt in middle school.\"\nIn the small town in Pennsylvania where she grew up before her family moved to Tennessee, Swift's nascent careerism saved her from joining the slacker crowd, but it also made for some lonely times. She'd play the 12-string guitar for hours, until her calluses bled, practicing and writing songs. \"On week ends, my friends were starting to party already, and steal alcohol from their parents. I was never even tempted\" and still isn't, vowing to wait until her 21st birthday before imbibing. \"What I was doing on weekends was sneaking into karaoke bars, singer songwriter nights, and festivals, plugging my guitar into little cracklingamplifiers. That separates you, when you're not doing the same stuff\"\n\"She's just very sure of who she is,\" says her mom, Andrea Swift. \"She's been that way since she was tiny. I don't know why-it's nothing I did, and when I was her age, I was doing everything I could to fit in. It's not stubbornness, just sureness. And she's self-governed because she chooses to be.\" There'll be no demonizingstage-mom horror stories here. Though Taylor's grandmother was an opera singer, \"music was never ny dream,\" says Andrea. \"We were on a farm, and I had her sitting on a pony when she was 9 months old. If my dream had gone well\" Mrs. Swift laughs, she'd be in a horse show right now.\"\nPer her MySpace confessions, Swift hasn't dated much lately Surely, after coasting along on writing about those high school beaus all this time, she could use some fresh material. \"You want to hear my new career and dating philosophy she asks, twirling another fry in her shake. \"When I find someone who fascinates me as much as my career,\" she says, con-spiratorially, \"I'm gonna go for it.\" Good luck, lads.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift’s Road to Fame\n\nBehind the scenes of the teen sensation’s career, from guitar lessons to sold-out shows\n\n”I love turning on pop radio and hearing my song,” allows Taylor Swift, the 18-year-old country music sensation. ”But,” she adds, mindful of her base, ”I don’t look at it as crossover as much as spillover.”\n\nHer cup definitely runneth over. In 2007, Swift’s debut album was one of the top 10 all-genre SoundScan sellers. And all those sales came in while a lot of non-country-lovers had yet to hear of her…or, if they had, were still asking, ”Taylor Swift? Who’s he?” She’s harder to escape now: Besides several smash hits at country radio, she’s moved into the upper levels of the Top 40 format with a remix of her heartbreak ballad ”Teardrops on My Guitar.” (In recent years, only Carrie Underwood, with ”Before He Cheats,” has successfully managed that leap.) MTV is even playing it. And since the album has such legs, it’s a good bet to cross the triple-platinum mark, almost unheard of in this era of plunging record sales. She’s got to be the most popular high school senior in America right now. So: teardrops, schmeardrops… Did being 18 ever suck any less?\n\nBut she wasn’t always the belle of the ball, personally or professionally; those rejection anthems she’s so adept at writing weren’t penned purely as fiction. We profiled the rising siren in this week’s issue of EW. But for this exclusive EW.com bonus feature, we also talked with some of the people who were with her on the way up, including her mother, manager, and label president, to find out some of the strategizing that went into achieving one of the last year’s few true musical success stories.\n\nThe chipmunk years. ”When I was 10, or younger than that, even, I would watch these biographies on Faith Hill or the Dixie Chicks or Shania Twain or LeAnn Rimes, and the thing I kept hearing was that they had to go to Nashville,” Swift remembers. She talked her parents into letting her fly out for a visit. ”I took my demo CDs of karaoke songs, where I sound like a chipmunk — it’s pretty awesome — and my mom waited in the car with my little brother while I knocked on doors up and down Music Row. I would say, ‘Hi, I’m Taylor. I’m 11; I want a record deal. Call me.”’ They didn’t. (But you have to wonder how many of the folks who answered those doors suddenly flashed back to that moment when they saw a grown-up Swift screaming over her Best New Artist nod at the Grammy nominations press conference.)\n\nRather than discouraging her, that rejection was like rocket fuel. It dawned on her that karaoke-style singing wasn’t going to cut it at any age; she needed to become a full-fledged guitar-picking singer/songwriter. ”She came back from that trip to Nashville and realized she needed to be different, and part of that would be to learn the guitar,” says her mother, Andrea Swift. Earlier, she had tried picking up an acoustic guitar and had no interest in it, but things had changed. ”Now, at 12, she saw a 12-string guitar and thought it was the coolest thing. And of course we immediately said, ‘Oh no, absolutely not, your fingers are too small — not till you’re much older will you be able to play the 12-string guitar.’ Well, that was all it took. Don’t ever say never or can’t do to Taylor. She started playing it four hours a day — six on the weekends. She would get calluses on her fingers and they would crack and bleed, and we would tape them up and she’d just keep on playing. That’s all she played, till a couple of years later, which was the first time she ever picked up a six-string guitar. And when she did, it was like, wow, this is really easy!”\n\nShe started writing, too. Two of the songs she’d recorded (”The Outside,” on her debut album, and ”Christmas Must Mean Something More,” from a Target-exclusive Christmas EP she released) were written when she was 12. When she went back to Nashville with her own songs in tow, people took notice: At 13, she signed a development deal with RCA Records, working with that label’s Joe Galante and Renee Bell, a couple of legendary figures in town. But when the deal came up for renewal after a year, she opted out, because she felt she’d have to record outside material if she got to the point of cutting her debut — and at 14, she was already married to the idea of only recording material she had a hand in writing. Not coincidentally, at 14, she became the youngest person ever signed to the major songwriting company in Nashville, Sony/ATV Publishing.\n\n \n\nNashville acceptance, hometown alienation. Swift started to feel cut off from some of her friends, since she was writing songs while they were either playing soccer or partying. ”A lot of people ask me, how did you have the courage to walk up to record labels when you were 12 or 13 and jump right into the music industry? It’s because I knew I could never feel the kind of rejection that I felt in middle school. Because in the music industry, if they’re gonna say no to you, at least they’re gonna be polite about it.” (Being unusually tall for her age, or any age — she’s now 5’11”, without her cowboy boot heels — may have made her more of a junior high outcast.)\n\nNow that she had publishing and recording deals in hand, she convinced her parents, when she was in the eighth grade, that it was time to move where the action is. ”I was from a small town, and nobody really expects you to leave, especially before you graduate. That doesn’t happen. I actually went back a couple months ago and played a sold-out show in my hometown, and it was amazing; ever since all this stuff started happening, the people in Pennsylvania have been the most supportive people I’ve ever known. But I wouldn’t change a thing about growing up and not exactly fitting in. If I had been popular, I probably wouldn’t have wanted to leave.”\n\nThe Swifts never pushed their daughter toward a music career, and the family uprooted itself from the Christmas-tree farm where they lived only after it was clear that her stockbroker dad could do his job just as effectively down South. ”I never wanted to make that move about her ‘making it,”’ says her mom, Andrea. ”Because what a horrible thing if it hadn’t happened, for her to carry that kind of guilt or pressure around. And we moved far enough outside Nashville [to nearby Hendersonville] to where she didn’t have to be going to school with producers’ kids and label presidents’ kids and be reminded constantly that she was struggling to make it. We’ve always told her that this is not about putting food on our table or making our dreams come true. There would always be an escape hatch into normal life if she decided this wasn’t something she had to pursue. And of course that’s like saying to her, ‘If you want to stop breathing, that’s cool.”’\n\nAfter getting out of her RCA deal, Swift found a believer in Scott Borchetta, who was then a big cheese at the Universal label group. ”I thought, ‘Oh, awesome, I’m gonna get to deal with Universal!’ I get this call a couple of weeks later, after I do this showcase and Scott’s on board and everything’s rocking. He goes, ‘I have good news and bad news. The good news is I want to sign you, and the bad news is I’m not gonna be with Universal Records anymore.’ Because he was leaving to start up this whole new record label.” She took a chance and went with what would become a new powerhouse indie label, Big Machine, figuring that at least she’d get more individual attention there. ”They only had 10 employees at the record label to start out with, so when they were releasing my first single, my mom and I came in to help stuff the CD singles into envelopes to send to radio. We sat out on the floor and did it because there wasn’t furniture at the label yet.”\n\n \n\nThe MySpace triumph. Swift’s album wasn’t Big Machine’s first release, or even its first relative success. Another early signing, Texas rocker Jack Ingram, had a song go to No. 1 on the country chart — but he still didn’t sell boatloads of albums. That would be up to Swift, and her success would help little Big Machine go on to become Garth Brooks’ new label, not to mention giving Borchetta the heft to sign Jewel (one of Swift’s childhood influences) to a country deal.\n\n”The story that everyone is gonna tell with Taylor is her use of technology and viral marketing techniques — MySpace and texting — that are non-traditional for the country format,” says RJ Curtis, country editor for the weekly trade magazine Radio & Records. ”This kind of flies in the face of how to market a new artist from Nashville. It’s partly her being in that life group and using the things teens use to communicate and spread music around, but her label had a lot of savvy in that area too.”\n\nBut Swift’s manager, Rick Barker, gives the singer and her family most of the credit for working the Web. ”The parents already had her MySpace and her website up and running,” he says. ”The mom and dad both have great marketing minds. I don’t want to say fake it until you make it, but when you looked at her stuff, it was very professional even before she got her deal. And we put her music up there on MySpace before it was out, to help decide what was gonna be on the record. ‘Our Song’ made it to the record because of MySpace.” That song has been her biggest radio hit to date — written about her first real romance, premiered at her ninth-grade talent show, and nearly lost to the cutting room floor. ”If you notice the running order on the record, ‘Our Song’ is No. 11,” the manager points out. ”It was the last song added to the album, and a lot of that had to do with buzz that was being created on MySpace.”\n\nOnce the album was actually finished and ready for promotion, MySpace came in even handier. ”People laughed at me,” says Big Machine founder-president Borchetta. ”They said, ‘You’re starting a new record label and you signed a 15-year-old female country singer — good for you! You have a teenager — there’s a lot of those on country radio. You have a new female artist — there’s a lot of those on country radio.’ They were looking at me like I had two strikes. But I knew we didn’t want to count on country radio out of the box. So we went heavy on TV, putting the video out before the single, and doing a special with [cable channel] GAC, and we went heavy on her MySpace and online stuff. By the time we got to country radio, we said: We have you surrounded and you don’t even know it.”\n\nIt still wasn’t an easy sell. ”Her records are not records that researched fantastically,” says R&R‘s Curtis — and he ought to know, because when Swift’s single ”Tim McGraw” was first coming out in late 2006, he was then the program director of L.A.’s KZLA, and one of the guys balking at putting her on the air. ”But the radio guys hung in there because anybody who’s programming a station wants to get some younger listeners. Country does a good job of naturally getting 35-plus listeners, so getting someone who fits the image of the 18-to-34-year-old, that’s an asset. There’s a need for [youthfulness] in the format. When Gretchen Wilson and Big & Rich and the whole Muzik Mafia thing came along a few years ago, I said that, for the first time since the Garth phenomenon in the early ’90s, there seems to be a real movement happening here. It didn’t last long, because it was more of a fad than a trend; Gretchen really only had that one huge hit, and while Big & Rich have continued to have big songs, it’s been with their more traditional-sounding ballads. But there is definitely a need for a younger artist, younger feel.” Curtis thinks Swift’s adolescent-themed songs have a dual appeal to older and more youthful listeners: ”A lot of the theme of the album is first love, and those are things everybody can get sentimental about, no matter the demo. With things like ‘Our Song,’ a lot of people can relate because it takes them back to their innocent years — and in her case, she just happens to be living her innocent years right now.”\n\nBarker, her manager, offers up some specifics about how they used MySpace to make the Taylor Case to radio. ”Radio does research, and we have no idea who they’re researching, but it was saying people weren’t digging ‘Tim McGraw.’ So we had to go out and create our own research — and that’s what we did with MySpace. What she did was put up a blog on her MySpace that said, ‘Guys, I would like to thank whatever station you’re hearing my song on.’ And people started telling us” — even with stations that were only tentatively programming the song in the middle of the night. ”We were able to take those comments back to radio in individual markets and say, ‘You’re saying researching is telling you it’s not doing that great, but here are 85 people who are telling us they love your station because you played ‘Tim McGraw.’ What MySpace and online told radio stations was: She’s already familiar to your audience. And radio loves familiarity.\n\n”MySpace allowed us to tell the story about Taylor. And it really is her space,” adds Barker. ”She wrote her bio, writes her blogs, and if someone gets commented back to, it’s from Taylor. A lot of times, you can tell it’s somebody else hired to sit there at a computer. Taylor’s space is her space — that’s our secret.”\n\n \n\nTaylormania. On a brisk night in late January of 2008, the nexus for all this popularity is the Rabobank Theatre, a sold-out 3,000-seater in inland California where Swift is doing a headlining show. About a third of the way back, one delusionally hopeful suitor holds up a sign with his plea: ”PROM? 343-7547.” In the front row, a college-aged dude in a cowboy hat patiently waits for a break in the shrieking before finally blurting out, with half-shy boisterousness, ”Taylor, you’re hot!” But it’s hard for a male fan to get a word in edgewise when the young women in the house spend the entire show standing and screaming, much as their little sisters would for Hannah Montana. There are enough kids and parents on hand that it’s clear she has some appeal to the Disney Channel demographic, as well as to the 17- to 25-year-olds who make up most of the audience, though she writes about adolescent romance not as an aspirant but a fellow survivor. Swift represents the countrified missing link between Miley Cyrus and Alanis Morissette.\n\nShe is introducing her soon-to-be-released fourth single, the gleefully vengeful ”Picture to Burn,” which, like many of her songs, was inspired by an old school flame she refers to as ”Bad Cheater Guy.” Swift’s so impressed by the screaming, while going into her nightly spiel about getting back at the boys who spurned her, she adds a nod to tonight’s host city. ”Please know that I try to be a really nice person, in general,” she says as her band vamps through the intro. ”But, if you break my heart, or if you hurt my feelings — or ANY OF MY FRIENDS FROM BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA — well, I will have to write a song about you!” Total eruption, as she marches across the stage in her spangly sun dress and cowboy boots, strumming on her six-string and singing: ”I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive/ You’re a redneck heartbreak who’s really bad at lying…”\n\nBefore the show, we watched her pose for photos for an hour at a meet-and-greet full of fan-club and radio-contest winners. (That’s nothing, for her; at most of the hundreds of shows she’s played so far, she stayed afterward to sign autographs till the last fan was gone, which might last anywhere from two-and-a-half to four hours. But as the crowds grow, those late-night signings are becoming increasingly more difficult to work in.) It’s clear that Swift doesn’t have the steeliness of a lot of starlets her age who were groomed for that by their parents almost from birth. Maybe because this whole massive career thing was her idea, she’s still digging it. When a little kid approaches, she gets down on her nyloned knees and cranes her neck in so that it is pressed against the tot’s. In pretty much every picture, she will look like that person’s conjoined twin. Every so often, with someone closer to her own age, she’ll say, ”Let’s do a funny one,” and urge the fan to screw up his or her face with her.\n\n”She can’t go now to a store without having people come up to her — which she loves,” says her mom, Andrea. ”It makes her day when she’s gone somewhere and people have come up to her and said, ‘I love your music — can I take a picture?’ She’s always grabbing the camera and going, ‘Come here’ and getting the MySpace shot, holding the camera and posing together. She likes that attention. I think where she differs from some people who get to that spot and realize that they don’t really like their privacy sort of being restricted — well, for her that’s not an issue.\n\n”But she never in her life ever said, ‘I want to be famous’ or ‘I want to be rich’ or ‘I want to be a star.’ Those words absolutely never came out of her mouth. If they had, I would have said, ‘Honey, maybe you’re doing it kind of for the wrong reasons.’ For her, the happiest I ever see her is just after she’s written a killer song. As a parent, I felt really good about that. If that’s where she draws happiness from, she’ll have that the rest of her life. She’s not always gonna have the awards, or the attention, or the celebrity, but she will always have the ability to write a song.”\n\n”She has the combination of that 30-year-old business mentality with a real innocence,” says R&R‘s Curtis. But can country fans and programmers — who tend to be a little bit territorial — expect to keep Swift to themselves? Will the pop crossover success get to her? ”We’re talking about an 18-year-old, so it’s hard to know for sure what she’ll be doing five years from now,” Curtis says. ”But just from talking with her, I would say that her value system is a really good fit for country.” And though MTV recently did its first airing of her ”Teardrops on My Guitar” video on TRL, it did look a little bit uncharacteristically wholesome, programmed between Britney and Pitbull, so it’ll be interesting to see how things play out.\n\nIn the meantime, there’s still high school to finish up — home-schooled version, while her mom accompanies her on some dates this spring, when she’ll be opening an arena tour for Rascal Flatts. Says Swift, ”I already finished most of my course work, so I just have two electives left.” Which are? ”Public speaking and vocal performance. I guess I’m kind of coasting.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "An unassuming ride to Teen Queendom\nPublished: Thursday, January 31, 2008, 11:11 AM     Updated: Thursday, January 31, 2008, 11:35 AM\nKalamazoo Gazette staff By Kalamazoo Gazette staff\n\nAn unassuming ride to Teen Queendom\nEven with success, young country star Taylor Swift says 'I'm not a big deal'\n\nBy John Liberty\njliberty@kalamazoogazette.com\n(269) _x0007_388-8579\n\nKALAMAZOO -- You know life is good when you're a teenager involved in a fender-bender and the owners of the other vehicle are geeked to see you get out.\n\nThat was the scene earlier this month when Taylor Swift, whose self-titled debut album is No. 1 on Billboard's latest country charts, was rear-ended at a stop sign near her home in Hendersonville, Tenn., just outside Nashville. When the people who hit her car saw the teen country star get out, they had an unusual request.\n\n\"When I got out of the car the people in the other car asked me to sign their headlight or tailgate or something. That was kind of weird,\" Swift, who turned 18 last month, said during a phone interview from her home last Tuesday.\n\nIt didn't end there.\n\nSwift, who is nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist, said a woman spotted the accident, then Swift, and left her car to get an autograph for her daughter. On her way to meet Swift, another car struck the woman's vehicle.\n\nThese days, pileups are a usual occurrence for the perpetually aw-shucksing Swift, who will perform at 8 p.m. Saturday for a nearly sold-out Miller Auditorium.\n\nThere is also a line of musicians, including the Eagles, Garth Brooks, Carrie Underwood and Reba McEntire, waiting for her to release her grip on the top of the country charts. The success of her 2006 debut album, which was reissued in late December with three new songs and a DVD, is abnormal.\n\n\nTypically, debut albums need to make a big splash on opening week before eventually settling into neutral. Swift's did the opposite. It started modestly and roared to the top several weeks after its release, producing three hits along the way, including her latest, \"Our Song,\" which had spent six consecutive weeks on top of the country singles chart through late _x0007_January.\n\n\"I don't know what made this album rise to the top,\" Swift said. \"It's blowing me away. I'm as shocked as anyone.\"\n\nPart of it may be her grass-roots growth courtesy of a rabid MySpace.com following and a sensitive side well suited for a younger audience. Swift wrote or co-wrote all the songs on her debut and has said in other interviews that \"Our Song\" was originally written for a ninth-grade talent show. One of her other hits, \"Teardrops On My Guitar,\" is about a boy named Drew from her former high school. Swift had a crush on him, but he liked another girl and she had to listen to how fabulous the other girl was during their class together. Another song, \"Tied Together With a Smile,\" is about one of her friends who had an eating disorder.\n\n\"For me, I don't try to hide anything or cover up vulnerabilities,\" Swift said.\nThe formula has worked. And, although Swift has been homeschooled since the release of her first single, \"Tim McGraw,\" in the summer of 2006, she plans to continue writing about \"boys, feelings and emotions.\"\n\n\"For me, my main goal is to never alienate my fans or throw them for a loop. For my second album, I won't change,\" she said.\nSwift said last week she's already recorded half of her new, yet-to-be-named sophomore album, due out in the fall. She's working with John Rich of Big & Rich and pop singer Colbie Caillat, who, like Swift, experienced a career boost from MySpace traffic. Caillat and Swift crafted the single \"Breath,\" which Swift said is about losing a close friendship but sounds like a breakup song.\n\n\"I'm extremely excited about the song I wrote with Colbie,\" Swift said. \"It's so my favorite thing on the record already. ... It's got a very cool vibe about it. It's hard to put my finger on it -- it's a moment.\"\n\nSpeaking of moments, Swift said winning the Horizon Award at the Country Music Awards in November is the highlight of her career to this point. She may have another coming soon at the Grammy Awards on Feb. 10. Swift is stacked up against other newcomers Amy Winehouse, Feist, Ledisi and Paramore.\n\n\"I'm not expecting to win it,\" Swift said. \"I'm expecting to have a lot of fun on the red carpet, hopefully wearing a cool dress.\"\n\nClothing and her image is another major part of Swift's vibe. The Pennsylvania-born, near-Nashville-residing singer/songwriter said she's most comfortable in a dress and cowboy boots and, unlike her pop counterparts, she's \"never going to want to take off my clothes -- that's just not who I am.\n\n\"I look out for who's watching now,\" Swift said. \"I'm conscious about the 6-year-old girl who might buy the magazine I'm on the cover of. ... I don't want her to open the magazine and I'm in a bra.\n\n\"There's a lot of pressure in the music industry, but there's a lot of pressure in everyday life. At the end of the day, the good music will rise to the top.\"\n\nAnd, based on the charts, her music is at the top. Swift said she tries not to be affected by her success. Before the CMAs, her mother sat her down and told her not to expect to win her category. It's a philosophy she's hanging onto as a bottleneck of hype, awards and praise -- such as being billed \"Country's Teen Queen\" by People Magazine last year -- are bumper-to-bumper behind her.\n\n\"You have to keep it real and not believe your own hype. I'm not a big deal,\" she said.\n\nTicket stub\nTaylor Swift, country, 8 p.m. Saturday, Miller Auditorium, Western Michigan University. Sold out. 387-2300.",

      "Transcript/Content": "L.A. Times: Country’s Taylor Swift keeps on the move\n\nBy Randy Lewis 02.06.08\n\nTHE music world is racing to keep pace with Taylor Swift. It’s a none-too-easy job requiring speed, stamina and dexterity now that the just-18 singer and songwriter is in high demand for TV talk-show guest spots, award-show performances and hosting gigs and gearing up for opening slots on three of country music’s big headlining tours for 2008.\n\nIt’s been nonstop since her debut album, “Taylor Swift,” topped the 2-million-sales mark and swept her to a best new artist Grammy nomination, a rarity for someone from the country music field.\n\nAnd Swift isn’t the type to slow down long enough for anyone to catch her. She spent her Christmas holiday working on her second album, due later this year, squeezed in a few headlining dates at some mid-size theaters, including the Wilshire Theatre in Beverly Hills just last month, and seemed utterly in control of all the plates she’s spinning during a whirlwind visit to a major music industry convention in Anaheim to thank the makers of the Taylor Guitars (no relation) she plays.\n\n\nShe was one of the guest announcers when the Grammy nominations were revealed in December, and figured she might be lucky enough to show up in one of the country categories, given the breakthrough success of her single “Tim McGraw” and succeeding hits “Teardrops on My Guitar” and “Our Song.”\n\n“I didn’t think I’d hear my name called in that category,” she said of her best new artist nomination. “The fact that I’m included with those others,” including critical faves Amy Winehouse and Feist, “that absolutely blows my mind. . . . To be included in an all-genre category like that, and to represent country music in that category, I can’t even tell you how happy I am about that.”\n\nIn Anaheim, before an enthusiastic crowd of instrument makers, sellers and their friends — the biggest gathering the Taylor booth has ever pulled in, according to company chief Bob Taylor, who rattled off an impressive list of previous rock and pop stars his company endorses — Swift noted that she was 14 when she wrote her recent hit, “Our Song.”\n\nIt may be the first No. 1 country hit that got its premiere at a ninth-grade talent show.\n\nAll the attention has put a lot of weight on her teenage shoulders, but her mother, Andrea Swift, said she and her husband have tried to ensure that their daughter stays focused on her love of music.\n\n“We’ve always made it clear that we didn’t need her to pay the bills,” Andrea Swift said as her daughter taped some announcements for the Academy of Country Music’s awards night in May. “She’s been writing songs since she was 5 or 6 and knew from the time she was 11 that this is what she wanted to do.”\n\nThe Swifts took Taylor to Nashville from their home in Wyomissing, Pa., for the first time when she was 11. “I started knocking on doors and saying, ‘Hi, I’m Taylor! I write songs and I’d like a record deal!’ ”\n\nNow she’s co-producing the new album with Nathan Chapman, who co-produced her debut, and Andrea Swift says it’s more than simply a case of a teenager set on getting her way. “When she writes her songs, she hears them in her head, and she knows where she wants the mandolin to come in, or what guitar lick should be there.” That led her to reject an offer from a giant Nashville record company in favor of signing with one that was just getting off the ground, Big Machine.\n\n“Obviously, creative control is the most important thing for me,” Swift says, “or I wouldn’t have left the biggest label in Nashville for a label that didn’t have any furniture.”\n\nShe says her goal for her next album is to reward those who responded to the first one, and find some new fans.\n\n“I look at my favorite artists and how I feel when they put out a new album, like Garth Brooks or Tim McGraw,” she said. “It still has so many things about the reasons I love that artist, but there’s new material. . . . I’m not going to throw anybody for a loop or try to change my sound or be edgier. I’ve aged two years and I’ve been writing for the past two years, and I really think there won’t be any fans who feel like I’ve tried to desert who I am.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Hit List: Taylor Swift\nThe Country Star and Grammy Nominee on Her Favorite Downloads\nBy JOHN JURGENSEN\nUpdated Feb. 9, 2008 12:01 a.m. ET\nCapping more than a year of steadily building success, 18-year-old country singer Taylor Swift is a nominee in the \"best new artist\" category at the Grammy Awards on Sunday. Her self-titled debut album has sold more than 2.5 million copies. Ms. Swift writes or co-writes all her songs, which feature an easy twang and a playful take on love. Like many young music fans, Ms. Swift makes most of her music discoveries online, where she jumps among music categories on iTunes. \"I'm definitely a country artist, and I'm proud of it,\" she says. \"But I don't think genres are going to be a huge part of how we categorize music in the future.\" Below, five tracks on Ms. Swift's personal playlist.\n\n* * *\n\nBoys Like Girls, 'Hero/Heroine'\n\nOne of Ms. Swift's most recent downloads, by a young pop-rock band from Boston, begins with danceable guitars and vocals but builds to a powerful payoff. \"It goes into the chorus and just slams,\" she says.\n\nListen to an audio clip of \"Hero/Heroine (Tom Lord-Alge Mix)\"\n* * *\nMat Kearney, 'Where We Gonna Go From Here'\n\nMs. Swift says she discovered Mr. Kearney, a singer-songwriter from Eugene, Ore., by Googling a line from this song, which she first heard on the TV show \"Grey's Anatomy.\" \"I fell in love with the way that he writes and the way that he sings,\" she says.\n\nListen to an audio clip of \"Where We Gonna Go From Here\"\n* * *\n\nJohn Mayer, 'Slow Dancing in a Burning Room'\n\nMs. Swift says this track shows off Mr. Mayer's dual skills as a lyricist and a guitarist. \"As a songwriter, you have to respect people who do it right and who create things you haven't ever heard before,\" she says.\n\nListen to an audio clip of \"Slow Dancing in a Burning Room\"\n* * *\n\nJustin Timberlake, 'Cry Me a River'\n\nOn this hit from the pop singer's first solo album, what starts as a breakup dirge develops into a revenge song. \"At the end of every single line you get a little chill because it's so true,\" Ms. Swift says.\n\nListen to an audio clip of \"Cry Me a River\"\n* * *\n\nKeith Urban, 'I Can't Stop Loving You'\n\nIn his take on a song Phil Collins is known for, Mr. Urban slows down the pace and adds a subtle country inflection. \"I'm a huge fan of his writing, but I'm also a huge fan of his song selection,\" says Ms. Swift.\n\nListen to an audio clip of \"I Can't Stop Loving You\"\nWrite to John Jurgensen at john.jurgensen@wsj.com",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor's Swift Rise\n\nShe landed a Nashville songwriting contract at age 14. Now at 18, with a hit record and awards-show wins, no star in country music may be hotter than Taylor Swift.\nBy Dennis McCafferty\n\nThe musical education of Taylor Swift began in Reading, PA., where she grew up listening intently to the great female country stars. Faith Hill's songs taught her about the connection that an artist can make through powerful singing. The Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain demonstrated how much impact can be made by stretching boundaries.\n\nToday, with a smash self-titled debut album that's approaching triple-platinum, it's refreshing that Swift still considers herself a student -- even though she's every bit the female country star as her influences. Her \"classroom\" is on the road, touring with stars as diverse and popular as Kenny Chesney, Rascal Flatts and George Strait.\n\n\"You can learn so much from watching how these guys approach their work on the road,\" says Swift, 18. \"Kenny is up at the crack of dawn, walking around the venue, getting to know everyone, from the sound-check guys to the people who sell the souvenirs to the fans. Then, Rascal Flatts stages this big production with all the flash. And George Strait? It's all about the music with him. He pays so much attention to building up the song, with the arrangements and the band and his singing. I'm so lucky to have these experiences. I can take something from each of the people I've toured with for my own act.\"\n\nSwift is learning her lessons well. During the last year, she's exploded upon the country music scene with huge record sales, sold-out shows and high-profile awards. On Monday night, Swift will return to the scene of her first major hardware win, as she presents the USA WEEKEND Breakthrough Video of the Year at Country Music Television's Music Awards (8 p.m. ET/PT). In 2007, she won the breakthrough award for the video of her smash hit, \"Tim McGraw.\" It started what continues to be a roll for Swift, as she subsequently won the much-coveted 2007 Country Music Association Horizon Award -- and earned a Grammy nomination this year for Best New Artist.\n\nThe breakthrough award sticks with her, given that it was the first and from her fans. \"I still take the award with me to all the fan appearances so they can get their picture taken with it,\" Swift says. \"It's a fan-voted award, which is why it means so much to me -- and them.\"\n\nIf Swift's career seems blessed, don't think it's all about precocious natural talent and her Faith Hill Version 2.0 looks. Despite her young age, Swift has been working for years to reach this point. In Reading, after hitting the karaoke circuit and writing songs, she recorded her first demos at age 10. Her father, Scott, is a successful stockbroker who moved his family near Nashville after it was clear that his daughter had both the talent and drive to make it in the business. \"They didn't put me under pressure at all,\" she says. \"It wasn't like, 'This is your one shot, so make it happen.' They presented it as a move to a nice community. If I made something out of it, great. But if that didn't happen, that's OK, too.\"\n\nThe move paid off. Honing her creative chops, Swift landed a songwriting contract with Sony ATV at age 14 and then started recording in Nashville. Big Machine Records offered a contract during her sophomore year of high school -- she'd record in the studio after school -- and, with \"Tim McGraw,\" her career took off.\n\nWhen not touring, she relaxes at home with her family or takes in a Nashville Predators hockey game with pals Kellie Pickler and Carrie Underwood.\n\nTaking a cue from her country music idols, Swift doesn't take her fans for granted. She e-mails them every day. And she draws the line at certain star behavior that defines the Britneys and Lindsays of today. \"I have moms coming up to me now saying that they're so happy that their little girls love my music because they feel that I am a good role model,\" Swift says. \"That message has stuck with me. I'm going to stay on course and not fall off the deep end. I don't want to end up in rehab. I promise you that I won't.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Exclusive: Taylor Swift Talks Tattoos And ‘Teardrops’\nby MTV Buzzworthy\n\nWe’re still feeling the burn from Spankin’ New Ladies Week … and we’ve got one last red-hot nugget for you: We were able to steal a few minutes with super-chill country girl Taylor Swift after her TRL performance last week. Here’s what she had to say about Eminem, getting a tattoo and all those “Teardrops” on her guitar.\n\nBuzzworthy: Were you surprised when your video, “Teardrops on My Guitar,” wound up on the TRL countdown?\nTaylor Swift: Yes. There were certain things that I thought were in reach, but that wasn’t one of them. I play country music, so when the song started crossing over, I didn’t think people were actually going to play it. But they did, and all of a sudden it’s a top 5 pop song.\n\nBW: Why do you think people have gravitated toward it?\nTS: I think the appeal is pretty much the lyric and melody. Honestly, I think the lyric can really relate to anybody. If you’re not feeling that way now, you may have felt that way in the past — when you liked someone who didn’t like you back. It’s kind of a universal feeling.\n\nBW: What was it like working with Tyler Hilton on the video?\nTS: It was amazing. He’s such a great actor and he brought out a lot in me. You know, because I’m not an actor. He was really, really cool and it was good to have the chance to become friends with him. He’s a sweetheart.\n\nBW: And you guys are a good match on camera because you’re both so tall...\nTS: Yeah, you don’t expect him to be so tall. I get those comments a lot. People walk up to me and are like, “Whoa, dude, you’re tall!”\n\nBW: Have you ever met anyone who’s left you totally star-struck?\nTS: Yes! Keri Russell.\n\nBW: Why her?\nTS: She’s, like, the coolest celebrity ever. I always wanted to meet her ’cause she just looks like she’s really cool — and when I met her in person she was that cool. It was really awesome. I think she’s done a really great job with her career. Waitress was the movie of the century.\n\nBW: You’ve been grappling with getting a tattoo. Have you made a decision yet?\nTS: I may get one. It was one of those things where I drew this heart on my foot with a permanent marker on the day of my album cover shoot and they took a picture of it and that picture ended up on the physical CD. So everyone was like, “Is it or isn’t it a tattoo?” It’s not. But I made this crazy pact that if I sold a crazy amount of records, like 2 million, I’d get it tattooed on. I honestly didn’t think that it would happen. We’re at 2.5 million right now. [Laughs.] So I’m, like, thinking, “Oh God, I have to get that.”\n\nBW: Well, you don’t have to…\nTS: I can back out of it. Mostly because my dad said he would take it off with a belt sander, so… [Laughs.]\n\nBW: Are you already working on your next album?\nTS: I am. I’m halfway finished with it, actually. There are some cool collaborations on it. I’m really excited about the song I wrote with Colbie Caillat; she sings harmony vocals on it. I just think she’s the coolest thing out there right now. So for her to be on my next album makes me feel cooler.\n\nBW: Is there a dream collaboration you wish you could get on there?\nTS: I have crazy dream collaborations. I look at people like Jay-Z and Eminem, and if there was anyway that it would make sense to, you know, collaborate with them … I would never want to do a collaboration that did not make sense. As for a live collaboration, I would love to do a show with Def Leppard. I’m a Def Leppard freak. To me, music has never really been defined by genre. Now, with digital and everything else going on, lines between genres are getting more blurred.\n\nBW: Is there a release date for the album yet?\nTS: We’re thinking it’s gonna be out in September.\n\nBW: Will you be on the road nonstop till then?\nTS: I’m always nonstop. I’m always on the road. I’m going to be touring with Rascal Flatts until December. So, that’s my next year.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Puts The Kid in Country\nAt 18, the Singer-Songwriter Already Has a Lot to Crow About. Sweet.\nBy J. Freedom du Lac\nWashington Post Staff Writer\nThursday, February 28, 2008\n\nLOS ANGELES -- So teenagerly, this country super-starlet Taylor Swift.\n\nTotally 18 going on 18. Totally acting -- and songwriting, and singing -- her age.\n\n\"What's Taylor like?\" says veteran country singer Vince Gill. \"She's like the back seat of my car when I take my kids to a movie. Everything is 'awesome,' 'she was like,' 'they were soooo.' It's really refreshing.\"\n\nNo sense rushing Swift into old age, right? Probably wouldn't be as much fun, for her or for us. Definitely wouldn't be good for business, which has been, well, awesome over the past year.\n\nSwift's smartly crafted songs about high school crushes, puppy love and teen heartache have made her a sensation. Her self-titled debut album -- released in 2006, when she was just 16 -- has sold more than 2.5 million copies and was one of the 10 bestsellers in popular music last year. And she hasn't even finished high school. (She's still being home-schooled.)\n\nSwift is a huge hit on MySpace -- 41 million song streams and counting -- and on the radio and television, too. \"Our Song,\" a lively relationship anthem that Swift originally wrote for a ninth-grade talent show, spent six weeks at No. 1 on the country chart while the accompanying video had a record-setting run on CMT, where it was parked at No. 1 for seven weeks. \"Teardrops on My Guitar,\" a confessional about a guy who is blind to Swift's feelings for him, is a crossover smash, with the video -- set in a high school, of course -- even landing on MTV, a network with a historical aversion to country music. (Yesterday, Swift appeared live on MTV's popular afternoon show \"TRL.\")\n\n\"She's attracting not just the traditional country audience, but a non-country audience as well,\" says Jay Frank, a CMT senior vice president. \"She's become a much bigger artist than the country format.\"\n\nNo surprise, then, that Swift won the Horizon Award at the Country Music Association Awards in November. She reveled in the moment, delivering an exuberant acceptance speech in which she memorably declared: \"This is definitely the highlight of my senior year!\"\n\nTotally!\n\n\"I'm just a teenager, you know?\" Swift says in an interview. It's early February, and she's sitting on an equipment case, deep in the bowels of the Staples Center here. She's just finished a brief rehearsal for the Grammys, where she's booked as a presenter and is nominated for best new artist -- the music industry's top award for newcomers. Ultimately, the award will be won by the troubled British R&B singer Amy Winehouse, who is perhaps the polar opposite of the squeaky-clean, all-American girl Swift, a straight-A student who always calls her mom if she's going to get home later than promised.\n\nBut, you know, whatever re Winehouse's win. Swift already has a great Grammy moment in her video scrapbook, from the December news conference to announce the nominees.\n\nFlashback: Swift is onstage, early in the morning, helping with the announcements. Her name is called. She appears to be overwhelmed, ready to start \"ohmyGod!\"-ing at any moment. She's fighting back tears, freaking out, hugging the other, much older artists, most of whom look like they're still asleep. So very Taylor Swift of her.\n\n\"I'm not going to try to act like some adult who has it all together and isn't fazed at all by that,\" she says. \"I am. I'm completely affected by it. I don't like it when people who are young act like they're 40. That's taking too much on. Putting up a shield and trying to act like you're so mature or whatever -- I don't try to act mature. Some people might say I'm mature for my age, but it's not something I'm trying to do, you know? I'm just me.\"\n\nGo to Swift's MySpace page, and you'll find a ton of real-life, real-time data -- maybe enough to write a quickie bio: \"Everything I Know About Taylor Swift I Learned Online.\"\n\nShe posts regular updates -- it's what the kids do these days, you know -- and her personal life is not off-limits. In fact, it's one of her favorite topics. Especially dating. Or not dating, as it were.\n\n\"I've never been the kind of girl who needs a boyfriend,\" she writes. \"I believe that love will find you when you're not looking for it. So I've been actively NOT looking for it for about 3 years now. I'll let you know how that works out for me. It probably doesn't help that I write songs about every guy I talk to.\"\n\nKinda true. Her breakthrough hit, \"Tim McGraw\" -- written during a math class! -- was about a relationship with a boy who was about to leave for college. Her current single? The sneering kiss-off \"Picture to Burn.\" \"It's about a guy I liked who didn't like me back, and I got really mad, you know?\" she says. In her liner notes, Swift offers a dedication: \"To all the boys who thought they would be cool and break my heart, guess what? Here are 11 songs written about you. HA!\"\n\nSo: Step carefully, boys.\n\n\"I have to pick a guy who's really nice,\" Swift says. \"I've got 2 million fans who are going to tell me if they don't approve of him, you know? That's sort of why I'm single. I don't want to have to find the right guy right now. I'm fascinated by my career and I'm not too fascinated by guys right now. I know that'll change and someday I'll have a great relationship, or a whatever relationship. But right now isn't the time for that.\n\n\"My friends are like: 'Oooh, look at him, he's cute.' But I have these blinders on. . . . It's not like I'm running out of time or whatever. But music is my boyfriend.\"\n\nShe's a willowy thing, 5-foot-11 in her bare feet but probably 6-1 in her stylish brown cowgirl boots. She's wearing a loosefitting dress with three-quarter sleeves and spangly trim. Piercing blue eyes, spring-loaded blond tresses, pouty little lips, an upturned nose. An affinity for mascara, too.\n\nShe grew up in Wyomissing, Pa., on a Christmas tree farm, where she became enamored of words, writing poetry and, during one summer vacation, a 250-page novel. \"She wrote all the time,\" says her mother, Andrea. \"If music hadn't worked out, I think she'd be going off to college to take journalism classes or trying to become a novelist. But her writing took an interesting twist when she picked up the guitar and applied her writing to music.\"\n\nShe showed enough aptitude as a songwriter and performer that her mother took her to Nashville with a demo CD. They went up and down Music Row, knocking on doors. \"I'm, like, 11,\" Swift recalls, \"and I'm saying, 'Hi, I'm Taylor, and I'd like a record deal.' \" She giggles at the memory.\n\nWhen she was 13, she landed a development deal with RCA. So precocious. That same year, her family moved to the Nashville area. Her deal with RCA soon fell apart. (The label wanted her to record songs by other writers; she wanted to do her own material. Are you smarter than a 14-year-old? No, apparently not.) But Swift quickly found a new backer: Scott Borchetta, an industry veteran who was planning to start a new label, Big Machine Records, and wanted Swift to be one of the centerpieces of his roster.\n\n\"She played some songs in our first meeting and I was just killed on sight,\" Borchetta says. \"She's the full package, somebody who writes her own songs, and is so good at it, so smart; who sings, plays the guitar, looks as good as she looks, works that hard, is that engaging and so savvy. It's an extraordinary combination.\"\n\nSo, then, no negatives? Maybe one, Borchetta says: Swift has actually gone off-plan, becoming so successful so quickly.\n\n\"My fear is that she'll conquer the world by the time she's 19. She'll get to the mountaintop and say: 'This is it?' Because she's just knocking down all of these goals that we didn't even have for the first album. . . . My job at this point is really to protect her and not burn her out.\"\n\nNo signs of wear just yet. Swift is tireless, focused, determined and weirdly enthusiastic about every part of the process of being Taylor Swift. Even the yucky promotional stuff. It's like she was programmed in a secret laboratory or something. She knows it, too.\n\n\"Maybe this makes me sound like a robot, but there is nothing more interesting to me than my career,\" she says. \"I feel sooooo lucky to have found something I love sooooo much. I don't have an identity without music. It probably sounds crazy, but I want to do everything I can to keep this precious thing intact.\"\n\nUp next: album No. 2 -- the sophomore effort from the high school senior. She's finished about half of the album, which should be released before the end of the year. Probably around the time she turns 19, in December.\n\nBut this obsession with her age: Maybe it's wrong? Brad Paisley, with whom Swift toured last summer, says Swift isn't great for 16 or 17 or 18; she's great period. But Swift writes from a particularly youthful perspective and connects with a particular demographic. \"Every kid relates to Taylor and those songs because they're pointed right at them,\" Gill says.\n\nSwift's teenagerly take? Whatever. \"I'm not concerned with people seeing me in a certain way,\" she says. \"Some people see me as a kid, some people see me as an adult. But I'm seriously not going to complain how anybody sees me, as long as they see me.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift performs tonight in Spartanburg\nHOWARD COHEN McClatchy Newspapers  |  Herald-Journal\nIf Taylor Swift, who performs at a sold-out concert at the Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium tonight, continues her skyrocketing success, one day some enterprising country artist might write a song called “Taylor Swift.”\n\nAfter all, such name-checking worked for Swift when she wrote her Top 5 single, “Tim McGraw,” while in math class during her freshman year of high school. The song became her first hit in 2007.\n\nWhile her peers were struggling with algebra, Swift scribbled the lyrics to “Tim McGraw” in her notebook and sneaked out of class to record a voice memo into her telephone when the melodies to “Tim McGraw” and her next country/pop crossover hit, “Teardrops on My Guitar,” came to her.\n\n“When teachers conducted random notebook checks, they'd be freaked out — but they learned to deal with me,” Swift muses in a telephone conversation from Hendersonville, Tenn.\n\nSwift wrote “Our Song,” which just spent six weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's country singles chart, for her ninth-grade talent show.\n\nSwift's popularity is such that, at this moment, she's outpacing the real Tim McGraw, not to mention Carrie Underwood, Rascal Flatts and Kenny Chesney at retail and radio.\n\nAt 18, she's a phenomenon. She's the youngest solo female ever to write or co-write every song on a No. 1, double-platinum, debut country album. (Even Dolly Parton didn't accomplish that.)\n\nIt's not difficult to understand why Swift has struck such a chord. She writes her own music — an accessible blend of “Wide Open Spaces”-era Dixie Chicks-styled country and pop — so she's able to tap into the same emotions her young audience feels. Nashville's power structure isn't feeding Swift her lines.\n\n“I'm not going to write songs about what it's like being on the road. I know 99 percent of my fans can't relate to that. I will write songs about things I can relate to and the people buying my album can relate to,” Swift says. “If I have to go back to when I was 13 and had a crush on the basketball player — who didn't notice me — that's what I'll do. Those feelings are universal.”\n\nFor Swift, whose parents moved to Tennessee from Wyomissing, Pa., so that, at age 11, their daughter could shop her demo tape around Nashville, the songs come for many reasons. She's already writing tunes for a second album, planned for late 2008, featuring a songwriting collaboration with other hot newcomer Colbie Caillat. In addition, Swift and pal Kellie Pickler, the “American Idol” alum, wrote a song “as personal as it gets” for Pickler's upcoming sophomore album.\n\nYet, even someone like Swift, for all her poise, obvious good looks and gift of gab, says she sometimes felt like an outsider.\n\n“ ‘The Outside,’ I wrote when I was 12, and not fitting in at school,” Swift recalls. “Being able to face the rejections of Nashville is nothing compared to facing the rejections at middle school. Songwriting is the best kind of therapy for me. I'm never tempted to drink to ease the pain of something.”\n\nBut mostly, Swift's songs come about because of boys.\n\n“When you go through a horrible breakup — from someone you should never have dated in the first place — it's a waste of effort. But if you write a song about the experience it's not a wasted experience, it helped the career. ‘Tim McGraw,’ that was about a guy I was dating who was going off to college. I wrote that in my freshman year,” she says.\n\nInterested? Who: Taylor Swift When: 7:30 tonight Where: Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium Tickets: Sold out Info: 582-8107 or www.crowdpleaser.com",

      "Transcript/Content": "The Billboard Q&A: Taylor Swift\nTaylor Swift has accomplished a lot for someone who turned 18 in December. By Ken Tucker / 03/26/2008\n\nTaylor Swift has accomplished a lot for someone who turned 18 in December. At 11 she was dropping off CDs of her singing to karaoke tracks to Nashville labels; at 14 she signed with Sony/ATV Tree Publishing; and at 16 she released her self-titled debut on Nashville independent Big Machine Records.\n\nThat album, which has sold 2.5 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan, has spawned three top 10 singles, including the six-week No. 1 “Our Song.” A fourth single, “Picture to Burn,” is No. 12 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart.\n\nIn April 2007 she was named breakthrough artist at the CMT Music Awards and in November she won the Country Music Assn. Horizon Award. She also nabbed her first BMI award in November for debut single “Tim McGraw.” Swift was nominated for a 2008 Grammy Award in the best new artist category, but lost to Amy Winehouse.\n\nA line of dolls inspired by Swift will hit the market this fall as part of a deal between JAKKS Pacific, a company that designs and markets toys, and Creative Artists Agency, which represents Swift. She is in the process of recording her sophomore effort, which is tentatively scheduled for a fourth-quarter release.\n\nNot to put the weight of the music business on your shoulders, but the music business, particularly country music, is struggling with capturing a younger demographic. As an 18-year-old, what does the business need to do to engage today’s youth?\n\nThe problem with the music business today in trying to capture today’s youth is they’re trying too hard. There are record labels that are admitting to the fact that they’re trying to copy the “model” that has worked for Taylor Swift and Big Machine Records. And the thing is, we just didn’t know any better. I was 16 years old and wrote all these songs about being in high school and sophomore relationships, not thinking that people would relate to it, hoping they would, but there really was no business model to make it work for the younger demographic.\n\nIf we can relate to lyrics, then we’re going to buy the music and I don’t think that’s a hard formula to figure out. People my age are really, really honest about what they like and what they don’t and they know it when they hear it and they know if they can relate to the lyrics.\n\nYou’ve had a Web site for years, even before you had a record deal. How did that come about?\n\nI was like 12 when we secured taylorswift.com and started putting up different versions of a Web site. And when we moved to Nashville my mom and I got really proactive with trying to make it really, really cool. We went to Mad Dancer Media, and we told them we wanted it to look like a scrapbook. And there are all these buttons on it and it opens the book and there are all these tabs and pages and we wanted it to be really interactive and really appropriate for where I was in my life at that point. I didn’t want a sleek, too cool site. I wanted it to be reflective of who I was as a person and who I am as a person. And that’s kind of casual.\n\nLast year at the CMT Awards you said that you spend at least half an hour a day on MySpace tracking people down and thanking them for their support. Is that still true?\n\nYeah, actually it’s very true. I spend so much time on MySpace. It’s the best way to figure out what your fans and what your friends and these people that helped you get where you are, what they’re going through and what they want to hear from you, what they’re liking, what they’re not. My MySpace is something that I made. The background that you see on there, I went to a Web site and copied the code and copy-and-pasted my “about me” section. I upload all the pictures, I check the comments, I am in charge of everything on that page. It really is important to me and really special to me when someone comes up to me and says, “I’m your friend on MySpace.” I’ve always taken so much pride in it just because it’s really personal to me.\n\nHow do you find out about music?\n\nI’ll go on iTunes and see what’s new. I will go on Web sites like mtv.com or cmt.com . . . I listen to the radio all the time. I listen to XM and Sirius in the car and they seem to always be on the cutting edge of having new songs that I’ve never heard. Satellite radio’s doing great things as far as breaking new songs and then you hear them on FM radio.\n\nI find the majority of my favorite new songs on my friends’ Myspace pages. Whatever my best friend Abigail has playing on her MySpace is usually something new and cool that I’ll most likely end up downloading. I think that’s how a lot of my generation finds music. MySpace is the new word of mouth.\n\nWhat music are you listening to now?\n\nI’m listening to everything. I’m a country artist and I think country music is the best kind of music ever, but I’m not going to sit here and go, “Oh, I only listen to country music.” I love Eminem, I love Kanye West as much as I love John Mayer and Coldplay and Maroon 5 and Boys Like Girls, and all these bands that are completely different, and the All-American Rejects. But then I’ll listen to Rascal Flatts and Kenny Chesney and George Strait. The lines in between genres are getting blurred more and more each day as digital is progressing further and further.\n\nHow is the new album coming?\n\nI’ve recorded six songs, including one that I wrote with Colbie Caillat, that she’s going to throw some harmonies on, which I can’t even wait to hear. And I’m going in to record six more this week and then we have another session scheduled for summertime. We’re really trying to just cut a bunch of stuff and put whatever is best on the album.\n\nWill you write or co-write everything, like you did on your first album?\n\nOf course. You know me.\n\nLiz Rose was a big co-writer for you on the first record. Are you writing with her again?\n\nI wrote eight songs on the first album with her and we need to catch up to that for the second record because I’ve written like eight songs for the second album by myself. If you’re in Arkansas, who’s there to write with?\n\nAre there any hold overs? Is there anything you wrote a long time ago that’ll make it on the new record?\n\nYes, definitely. There are songs that I wrote when I was 13 that I think are perfect to bring out now. I didn’t get a chance to put ’em on the record the first time around. There’s so much stuff that I’m gonna to pull from the back drawer and then there’s some stuff that I will write today and cut tomorrow.\n\nSo what kinds of things were you writing about when you were 13?\n\nWhen I was 13 I was writing about the same things that I’m writing about now, of course, boys. And I’ve always been fascinated by the way that people treat each other and the way that they interact. Stuff like that just really, really fascinates me and always has. I love writing about relationships, relationship songs are it for me. It’s my comfort zone, it’s my favorite thing to write about and my first album is scattered with them. And so that’s what I’m going to be doing a lot for my second record, too. You know, if it ain’t broke…\n\nYou dedicated your last album to all the boys who broke your heart. In a recent interview you said that you hadn’t even kissed a boy in two years, so what’s going to be your inspiration this time around?\n\nOh trust me, getting inspired by a guy or being frustrated and getting your heart broken has nothing to do with [being] physical. Sometimes if someone plays with your emotions it is so much harder to get over, whether you’ve kissed that guy, whether you’ve held hands with that guy, whatever you’ve done. If someone knows how to push your buttons and completely plays you, whether you were physically in that relationship or not, it’s very easy to get inspired by that. I definitely have not run out of any kind of material.\n\nWhat are you going to do when you do meet someone and you’re happy?\n\nYou know songwriting is all about being able to paint a story and tell a story, and sometimes that’s telling a story to yourself. Sometimes that’s using your imagination to transplant yourself back to when you got lied to. I write when I’m happy too. The number one song that I had, I wrote when I was in a relationship.\n\nHow are you balancing your school work, the music business, being on the road and real life?\n\nBalancing all this is not hard. I mean what do I have to complain about? I have the best time in the world. I’m so lucky. When I go out in public and I go to a mall, yeah it’s a lot different than it was two years ago, but it’s a beautiful kind of different. It’s the kind of different that I’ve wanted my entire life. I’m a strong believer that if you work your entire life for something, and you work so hard and you want this one thing so much, you should never complain once you get it.\n\nDo you have a ringtone on your phone?\n\nI have a few different ones. It’s kind of fun because now that a lot of my friends have music out there I’ll download it. Like for Kellie Pickler, when she calls I have “Red High Heels” ring, which I think is hilarious. It makes me laugh. But my ringtone now is “Hero Heroine” by Boys Like Girls.\n\nDo you have ringback too?\n\nI do have ringback and it’s “Taylor” by Jack Johnson, which is so awesome because people call and it’s like ‘they say Taylor was a good girl,’ it’s so cool.\n\nA few months ago the Tennessean published a picture of you at a Predators game with Carrie Underwood and Kellie Pickler. Is that a regular thing?\n\nKellie’s like my sister and Carrie—our schedules are so crazy that it’s like when are you ever in the same town—but I absolutely love her and I think she’s an amazing human being. But Kellie and I are always, for some reason, in the same place at the same time. We toured together last summer on the Brad Paisley tour and just became the closest of friends. She’s literally like my sister and she’s absolutely the most hilarious and honest person that I think I know.\n\nDo you ever talk business?\n\nSometimes we’ll talk business. It’s really cool to be friends with someone who has the same job as you. It’s like being best friends with a co-worker. You can complain about the same things and you can dish about the same things and get feedback on different things. And we wrote a song together for her new album, which I’m really excited about, it’s like the coolest thing. It would be completely naïve to ignore the fact that we’re in the same business when we can bounce ideas off each other and talk about that stuff, but you know we’re also talking about stuff that friends talk about.\n\nWhat’s the song that you wrote with her?\n\nIt’s called “The Best Days of Your Life” and it rocks.\n\nWhat are your plans for the rest of the year?\n\nI’m graduating from high school. I’m home-schooled— I don’t go to a regular high school anymore, but I do graduate, which is really exciting. There’s a home-school academy and you can go there and go to graduation. It just depends on whether I have a show that day or not. I’m gonna be touring with Rascal Flatts throughout the summer into the fall. Putting together a new record is what I’m the most excited about.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Shares Story and Success of Award-Winning \"Our Song\"\nBy Craig Shelburne / April 15, 2008 / 3:37 PM\n\nTaylor Swift wrote \"Our Song\" for a ninth grade talent show, but the stage was a lot bigger -- and the crowd a lot more enthusiastic -- on Monday night (April 14) when the 18-year-old singer-songwriter picked up female video of the year and the overall video of the year trophies at the fan-voted 2008 CMT Music Awards in Nashville.\n\nAsked about the song, Swift confessed backstage, \"I never thought it was going to be on an album. I never thought I'd get to record it. I never thought it would be a single, I never thought it would go No. 1, and I never thought it would win video of the year. I am absolutely taken aback and so, so incredibly, unbelievably, unbelievably grateful.\"\n\nSwift was barefoot for most of the night because her stylish, 4-inch, hot pink heels were killing her feet. \"I was limping up the stairs,\" she said. \"I walked past Faith Hill and I whispered, 'This hurts so bad,' and she was like, 'Take 'em off!' At that point, I just took off my shoes and did not put them on for the rest of the night. I actually accepted an award barefoot and presented an award barefoot. You know, Faith Hill told me to do it, so I did it.\"\n\nIn 2007, Swift won the buckle-shaped CMT trophy for breakthrough artist and took it on tour with her so fans could take their photos with it. This year, she said, she was thrilled to be asked to sing on the show, but she didn't think she'd win anything.\n\n\"I really didn't honestly think I would get to take away an award,\" she said. \"The fact that the fans would do this for me again this year completely blows my mind. I can't even believe it. There's nothing that is more important to me than my fans and making them happy. I never want to let them down. The fact that they would do this for me... that they would vote for me ... in those categories! It's so unbelievable. I am absolutely so flattered, humbled and having the best night I can remember. It's so exciting!\"\n\nWhile sharing her memories of making the \"Our Song\" video, Swift replied, \"I remember all the outfits, and I remember how [video director Trey Fanjoy] had this video in her head. When she heard the song, she had this idea for a front porch performance and then a field of flowers for another performance, then a black-and-white performance shot. It all came together in her head. She was able to translate that so well onto film. It just shows what a truly great director she is.\"\n\nSwift also chatted about her new video, \"Picture to Burn.\" She said, \"I used some pyro on the new video. I was a little afraid that I might catch on fire. They had a guy with a fire extinguisher right there on set, so it was safe, I guess. It was a two-day shoot. That's the longest we've ever shot before.\n\n\"The storyline of the video is, if you break up with me, my band will ransack your house,\" she explained. \"It was so much fun to get to have my band in the video and my best friend Abigail in the video. And so many cool people walking around. I'm blown away by the video crews and the lighting crews and the people who are setting up all these things. I would never be able to do that. I am blown away that all these people can work together and help me out so much.\"\n\nAsked about her recent crossover success on pop radio, Swift was quick to thank country programmers.\n\n\"I walked into their radio stations as a 16-year-old girl with a song named 'Tim McGraw.' And I don't think it gets any weirder than that. The fact that they opened their arms and embraced me, I will never, ever forget them as long as I live. Country radio is where my base is, and I love them so much.\n\n\"The fact that pop radio stations are playing my songs is amazing to me. I am so blown away and so thankful for it. I like to think of it less as crossover and more as spillover. That's what they call it at my record label -- 'spillover.' I am so thankful for the spillover and for everybody who's just been so amazing.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Guitar picks lead to Taylor Swift, prom invitation\nBy Jeff Jardine 04.15.08\n\nSome things to make your April 15th a bit less, well, taxing:\n\nCAN’T HURT TO ASK — You could say that when it comes to asking a girl to the prom, Modesto High junior Jon Key really knows how to pick ’em. Guitar pick ’em, actually.\n\nThis one will take some explaining.\n\nJon’s dad, Stephen Key, is an inventor and marketer who created a line of hologram guitar picks. His “Hot Picks” are embedded with images that change as you move the pick, giving them a motion- picture-like quality. They’re modern technology’s version of the old nickelodeon, sort of — and without the nickel.\n\nIn February, Stephen received a call from Scott Swift. Swift’s daughter, 18-year-old Taylor Swift, is one of the music industry’s hottest young country crossover artists. Dad Swift spotted some of Key’s hologram picks — get this, at a Shell gas station in Tennessee — and wanted to create a line to help promote his daughter’s career.\n\n\nKey developed a set of six Taylor Swift picks. With Taylor performing at Sacramento’s Arco Arena last week, the Swifts invited Key and his family to be their guests at the concert, including a meet-and-greet just before the show. As it turned out, someone had overbooked the meet-and-greet, which is a fancy name for a photo and autograph session.\n\nThe Keys, along with family friend Grant Casey, got in long enough to meet, greet and receive a Taylor Swift calendar. But Stephen didn’t have time to show his prototype picks to Taylor — the very reason they were invited to the show.\n\nSo Andrea Swift, Taylor’s mom, invited them back to her motor home for a visit after the performance.\n\nJon Key and his buddy, Grant, talked about what they’d say when they met her face to face.\n\nSometime during the conversation, Andrea Swift mentioned that Taylor missed out on her high school prom because of her performing commitments.\n\nJon, 17, decided to ask her to be his date to Modesto High’s prom April 26.\n\n“I was thinking I wanted to make this as cool as possible even though it’s a weird question to ask,” Jon said. “So I said, ‘Now this is awkward. I’m going to ask you a question, but I don’t want you to answer (aloud). Write your answer on my calendar. Do you want to go to my prom with me?”\n\nTaylor laughed and said, “Really?”\n\n“I said, ‘Yes, of course,’ ” Jon said. “She wrote down ‘Yes!!!’ ”\n\nYes, as in, you’ve got yourself a date — until, that is, her mom got on the computer and discovered Taylor has a commitment that night, Stephen Key said.\n\nOh, well. It was a valiant try that made Stephen an even prouder papa. He’s convinced, after seeing the show, that Taylor Swift will become a megastar and that Taylor Swift guitar picks will be a hot seller.\n\nJon, meanwhile, came away with an autographed calendar. He has a photo of himself and Taylor that could make millions of other teen boys absolutely jealous.\n\nAnd he can always dream of the prom date that might have been.\n\nTo see the Taylor Swift guitar pick prototypes, visit www.hotpicksusa.com/taylorswift.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Swift Friendship\n\nIssue date: 4/28/08 By Josh Rouse\n\nThe scene begins in a car, with the pair of friends spying on an ex-boyfriend. A vehicle arrives, and behind a pair of binoculars comes a shocking statement.\n\n“He’s got a girl with him… she’s driving the truck.”\n\nThe scene is from Taylor Swift’s “Picture to Burn” music video, and the voice belongs to her best friend Abigail Anderson, who will begin her collegiate career next year at the University of Kansas. \n\n“That’s actually kind of what we’re known for,” said Anderson of their real-life adventures. “We don’t use binoculars or anything like that; we go more like stealth mode. We don’t stake out at someone’s house, we just do a drive-by just to check up on them and see how they’re doing. There’s no harm.”\n\nWhile the scene is a fitting beginning to the video, the beginning of this friendship began during their ninth-grade year. Swift and Anderson were taking the same English class, and the discussion had turned to Shakespeare. It was then that they learned what they had in common.\n\n“We were the ones in the back of the class saying negative things about Romeo and Juliet because we were so bitter toward that emotion at the time,” said Anderson.\n\n“We just really connected; we were obsessed with Napoleon Dynamite, and ever since then we have been inseparable.”\n\nComing to Kansas\n\nAnderson, who signed a National Letter of Intent last November to join the swimming program at KU, said she wanted to choose a school early to take some of the pressure off of her for swimming. She was a three-time high school All-American during her time at Hendersonville High School in Tennessee.\n\n“It was the hardest decision I’ve ever made in my entire life,” said Anderson. “I looked at a lot of great schools and Kansas was ranked awesome in the journalism program. Their swimming is awesome. I was totally surprised by the campus. The biggest thing for me is to get away. I’ve lived here my entire life and I’m so ready to just move on. If it doesn’t work for me, at least I tried.”\n\nIn the process of moving on, Anderson will also be moving further away from Swift. However, they have learned how to make the friendship work despite the distance between them.\n\n“We’ve thought about it, we’ve cried about it,” said Anderson. “It’s going to be difficult. What we have as an advantage is that I’ve gone through the past few years of not having her physically around. She’s been on radio tours, she’s been on headline tours, she’s been out on the road with Rascal Flatts and Brad Paisley. Sometimes I’ve gone without seeing her for an entire month. It gets really hard, but it’s that time in our lives where I have to go. It’s been difficult, but we’re kind of used to it.”\n\nWith her best friend making the move to Kansas, Taylor may be doing more shows in Kansas after this semester. Anderson said they had already talked about her scheduling arrangements and hoped she would have plenty of opportunities to see her in the future.\n\n“We’ve already talked about it and she’s going to schedule as many [shows in Kansas] as possible,” said Anderson. “We’re going to make it work. I’m not too concerned with that.”\n\nTheir song\n\n“She signed when she got here as a songwriter, and it was just really interesting being able to follow her,” said Anderson. “She came and she entered in the talent show the first week she moved here and everybody was just amazed by this girl’s ability.”\n\nThrough the years, Anderson has been able to watch her friend write song after song while chasing her dream of stardom. As a result, some of Anderson’s own experiences have made their way into Swift’s lyrics.\n\n“The thing is, we don’t sit down and talk about what she needs, but many times she has been inspired by like a story of mine or something I experienced,” said Anderson. “Because we’re so close she experiences it too.”\n\nIn fact, one of the songs on Swift’s upcoming album is all about Swift’s friendships. The song is called “15,” which is the age Taylor and Abigail were when they really became close. Anderson said she is excited to see how it turns out.\n\nProud moment\n\nJust weeks ago, Swift won the “Video of the Year” and “Female Video of the Year” awards at the 2008 CMT Music Awards. Anderson said seeing her friend get so much recognition for the hard work she does is a proud and inspiring experience.\n\n“Oh my gosh, I never get used to seeing her on TV or hearing her on the radio, but to watch something like that, it really, honestly brings tears to my eyes,” said Anderson. “I’ve watched from the beginning. I’ve watched her be denied by record labels. I’ve watched her play guitar until her fingers bleed. It’s so awesome to see somebody succeed, to see somebody put so much effort into something. It’s very, very inspiring to be on the sidelines and be able to witness something like that.”\n\nCountry cameo\nAnderson has had a cameo role in three of Taylor Swift’s music videos: “Picture to Burn,” “I’m Only Me When I’m With You” and “Teardrops On My Guitar.”\n\n“I’m obsessed with that whole scene and everything,” said Anderson. “It’s a great opportunity for somebody my age to just follow her. I’m not so much following in her footsteps, but just getting to experience and witness what somebody goes through when they become a celebrity or they are in the limelight. Any opportunity she gives me like that, I definitely take it.”",

      "Transcript/Content": " Country music wunderkind Taylor Swift announced today on \"Good Morning America\" that her self-titled debut album has gone triple platinum.\n\n\n\"They told me … it's triple platinum. It's freaking me out. I'm so excited!\" said Swift, who was featured as a \"GMA\" Breakout Artist in 2004.\n\nBesides selling more than 3 million albums, the 18-year-old has a lot to be excited about. She's won a truckload of awards and recently appeared on the covers of Seventeen magazine, Rolling Stone and Blender.\n\nSwift had her eye on fame from a young age, and she's hustled to achieve success. At 11, she went to all the Nashville labels to drop off CDs of herself singing to karaoke tracks.\n\nSwift, who wrote the hit single \"Our Song\" for her ninth-grade talent show, is the first female solo artist in country music history to write or co-write every song on a triple-platinum record. The Nashville Songwriters Association International named her the 2007 songwriter/artist of the year.\n\nThe teen has received a slew of awards, including the prestigious CMA Horizon Award in 2007, and she was nominated for a 2008 Grammy Award in the all-genre Best New Artist category. To top it off, she's the No. 1 country artist on MySpace, with more than 45 million song streams.\n\nSwift said she's not slowing down either. \"I'm in the middle of my second album. It will out in the fall, and I'm touring with Rascal Flatts this summer,\" she told \"GMA.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "A Swift Kick in the Pants\nIn a sea of drowning pop-tarts, Taylor Swift seems to be doing swimmingly\n\nBy David Kronke, Film Critic\nArticle Launched: 05/01/2008 02:50:20 PM PDT\n\n\nTaylor Swift\nWhile the number of teen pop idols succumbing to public scandal increases on an almost daily basis - add Miley Cyrus' suggestive Vanity Fair photo shoot of this past week to the previous tabloid trainwrecks that are Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan - country music's teen sensation Taylor Swift stands alone, firm in her resolve to remain a role model for her young fans.\n\n\"It's kind of critical for me,\" the 18-year-old Swift proudly declares of her clean-cut image.\n\n\"I tour all the time, and I'm constantly face-to-face with people who are buying my music; I look them in the eye every single night. And I hear it all the time, but I only had to hear it once, where a mother would come up to me and say, `Thank you for being a role model.' \"\n\nShe continues, \"I came to the conclusion that I never, ever want to let those people down. I let that govern my life, and I'm proud of it. I do what I can to live right and to set an example. I consider myself lucky to be in this position.\"\n\nProving her commitment, Swift even became part of a campaign against Internet predators after scrolling through a message board dedicated to her music and finding a spurious message offering young fans a chance to meet her backstage.\n\nSwift is just one of a number of country-music superstars taking part in the three-day Stagecoach festival - which replaces last weekend's Coachella rock- and dance-music lineup under the desert stars in Indio - and includes such headliners as the Eagles, Rascal\n\nFlatts, John Fogerty, the Judds and Carrie Underwood, along with dozens of other acts. Even at her age, she'll be one of the most accomplished.\nHer eponymously titled debut album, which came out when Swift was 16, became the first triple-platinum album to be released by a female country artist who wrote or co-wrote every song on the recording.\n\nLast week, she became the first musician to be named the Superstar of Tomorrow at the Young Hollywood Awards (previous winners include Katherine Heigl, Shia LaBeouf and Brandon Routh). And when, earlier this month, her coquettish performance in her video \"Our Song\" - which begins with the long-legged, 5-foot-11 singer airing out her pedicure - was named CMT's Video of the Year, she beat out a formidable field, for all of whom she had been serving as an opening act, including her current headliner, Rascal Flatts.\n\n\"I'm still in shock about it; I had absolutely no expectations of having my name heard,\" she says, adding of her competition, \"I got calls from each of them. It was the coolest thing.\"\n\nAt an early age, Swift was seduced by country music and inspired by young performers such as LeAnn Rimes - but she lived in Pennsylvania, hardly the home of celebrated country superstars. Since she didn't relate to her friends' party-hearty attitudes, she felt an outcast and convinced her parents to move to Nashville so she could pursue her dreams.\n\n\"The thing that set me apart in junior high was that on weekends I was going to songwriter nights and guitar lessons, while my friends were going to parties and stealing their parents' alcohol,\" she reflects.\n\n\"I didn't get it - I was not into the same things. It hurt me socially, but I've never regretted any choice I've made. Being not accepted in school inspired me to start writing and putting my emotions to music. My first songs were about that, and I've always appreciated that.\"\n\nOnce in Nashville, Swift says, her parents \"never saw my passion fade. They could never write it off as a crazy phase that kids go through; it just became more intense. They saw how happy it made me, how obsessed I was with going to Nashville, and for them, it was a remarkable leap of faith.\"\n\nAt age 13, Swift got a development deal with RCA Records, country music's biggest label, but when it wasn't ready to record her, she bolted to Big Machine, a nascent label that at the time not only had no artists but, as Swift puts it, \"had no furniture and no paint on the walls.\n\n\"Nobody does that,\" she concedes. \"But they didn't worry about their credibility.\n\n\"It was a tough decision,\" she continues. \"I love everyone (at RCA). They took a chance on me before everyone else, but ... helping to start up a different label was a cool thing, and I'm extremely proud of that.\"\n\nSwift's songs essayed the travails of teen romance, yet managed to expand them to a bigger canvas, to which all who heard them could relate Her first hit single, \"Tim McGraw,\" concerned an ill-fated yet star-struck couple who fall in and out of love to the country singer's music.\n\nEver since Swift performed the song in front of McGraw at an awards show, she says, he and his wife, Faith Hill, send her flowers on her birthday.\n\nSwift insists, \"I promise you that\" her real life isn't as wrenching as her relationship songs might lead one to believe. Outside of a prom date recently manufactured for an MTV special (her date was \"the best possible\"), she hasn't so much as kissed a boy in two years.\n\n\"I've gone through breakups and the core emotions behind them, but it doesn't take much to get that sort of emotion out in a song, luckily for me,\" she says. \"For my second record (due later this year), such inspiration has not been wrung dry, believe me.\"\n\nAnd, just as she drew upon McGraw's material to inspire her hit, does she imagine a lyricist somewhere writing a song titled \"Taylor Swift\"?\n\nSwift laughs, but also seriously answers: \"I can only hope.\"\n\nSTAGECOACH\n\nWhat: Three-day country-music festival featuring (among many others):\n\nFriday: the Eagles, John Fogerty, Trisha Yearwood and Shelby Lynne.\n\nSaturday: Rascal Flatts, Taylor Swift, the Judds and Dwight Yoakam.\n\nSunday: Tim McGraw, Carrie Underwood, Big & Rich and Gretchen Wilson.\n\nWhere: Empire Polo Field, Indio.\n\nWhen: Gates open noon Friday.\n\nTickets: $95 per day; $249 for the entire weekend (camping sites extra) at www.ticketmaster.com, (213) 480-3232 or (714) 740-2000.\n\nInfo: Go to www.stagecoachfestival.com for a schedule of times and additional acts.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Best of Rock 2008’s Best Country Lolita: Taylor Swift\n\nHow the eighteen-year-old crossover success is reinventing teen stardom\nGAVIN EDWARDS\n\nPosted May 01, 2008 9:00 AM\n\nMariah Carey and her entourage move through the MTV hallways in a flying wedge, backing Taylor Swift into her dressing room. That room’s approximately the size of a shoe closet, but Swift doesn’t care. Today is going to be her first time performing on TRL — but it’s her second time visiting the MTV show’s Times Square studio. Back when Swift was sixteen, she snuck into the studio to see Hillary Duff. A lot’s happened in Swift’s life since then. She’s had 40 million visitors to her MySpace page, her album’s been on top of the country charts for fifteen consecutive weeks and three of her hit singles have crossed over to the pop charts. And she’s reached the ripe old age of eighteen.\n\n\n \n\nBefore the show, Swift records a bunch of PSAs. The sound guy is pleased to discover he can clip a wireless microphone to one of her cowboy boots. “It’s never okay to ignore discrimination,” Swift intones solemnly into the camera. Then she has a question for the director: “You want me to say it three different ways so you guys have options?”\n\n“Sure,” he says, slightly flustered. “Maybe you should be directing this.”\n\nSwift performs “Teardrops on My Guitar” sporting a black dress and a sparkly silver guitar that matches her eyeshadow. The song’s about being friends with a boy who’s crushed out on another girl. “There he goes, so perfectly / The kind of flawless I wish I could be,” Swift sings, sounding totally lovelorn — but with wavy blonde hair and long legs, looking ridiculously flawless herself. During the guitar solo, Swift leans back, sees herself rendered several stories tall on a Times Square video screen, and nods at her guitarist.\n\n“I will remember that moment for the rest of my life,” Swift says later that day, on a private plane heading down to Greenville, South Carolina. “It was a little nod of ‘this moment rocks.'” Swift and her crew are crammed into the eight-seater Learjet like gerbils in a thermos. Her sound guy is sitting on the plane’s toilet.\n\nTaylor scrolls through some pictures on her iPhone: the most recent set are from her eighteenth birthday party last December, when her record label gave her a pink pickup truck. (She donated it to charity.) In an early photo session, Swift drew a heart on her left foot with a magic marker, and then vowed that if her album sold two million copies, she’d get that heart tattooed. Now that she’s sold more than 2.5 million copies of Taylor Swift, she has a karmic date with a tattoo needle, but she’s looking for a loophole. “I can back out of it,” she insists. “Mostly because my dad said he’d take it off with a belt sander.”\n\nIn retrospect, Swift’s meteoric success may seem like a no-brainer: all you have to do is find a teenage girl who’s modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch and who writes catchy songs, and then proceed to market her like High School Musical for the country-music market. But before it happened, the conventional wisdom was that although LeAnn Rimes sold tens of millions of records as a teenager in the Nineties, a teenager couldn’t have a country hit these days. For advertising reasons, most modern country radio stations are narrowly focused on women over thirty.\n\nAs it turns out, Swift is a rare blend of goofy teenager and polished saleswoman, which has let her tap into a huge market of country-loving teens. She can trade Napoleon Dynamite quotes for hours, but she’s also mastered the art of smooth-talking radio station personnel: her manners are as perfect as her complexion. When she enters the studio of Greenville’s WSSL the next day, she makes sure to compliment the DJ on the new paint job. She is sunny and chipper on the air, and even does the weather report in a bad Cockney accent.\n\nThe DJ, Kix Layton, has brought along his fifteen-year-old daughter, Jordan. Swift poses for pictures while speaking the common language of MySpace and Zoolander. “Let’s do one where we smile,” Swift tells her, “and then we’ll do Blue Steel.” If Swift were still in school, this would be her senior year. Instead, she’s approving designs for a line of Taylor Swift dolls.\n\n“You smell great,” Jordan says. “What are you wearing?”\n\n“Britney Spears’ Fantasy,” Swift says.\n\nSwift grew up on a Christmas-tree farm in Pennsylvania. Around age seven, she switched from the Spice Girls to LeAnn Rimes, and soon wanted nothing other than to sing country. Her family visited Nashville when she was ten; Swift dropped off demo tapes with every record label she could find. One year later, the family moved to a Nashville suburb. Swift kept writing songs — even in math class. She debuted “Our Song” at a school talent show when she was in ninth grade; the song ultimately spent six weeks on top of the country chart. Swift opted out of an early record deal where the execs didn’t want her to perform her own material, and by age sixteen, had released her debut, with eleven songs, all written or cowritten by her.\n\n“Pictures to Burn” has a lyric that perfectly captures the mindset of a teenage breakup: “Go and tell your friends that I’m obsessive and crazy / That’s fine; I’ll tell mine you’re gay.” Swift later modified that line so as not to give offense, but her songs are wittier and more evocative than the output of many writers twice her age. If she keeps maturing as a songwriter, she’ll be a fearsome talent in a few years. “My favorite song on the record lyrically is called ‘Cold As You,'” she says. “The hook is ‘I’ve never been anywhere cold as you.’ I love a line in a song where afterward you’re just like?burn.” Are her best songs burn songs? “Nah, I think my best songs are longing heartbreak songs.” These days, Swift writes those songs largely from her imagination — she broke up with her last boyfriend two years ago so she could focus on her music. “I put these blinders on and I have not taken them off in two years. I don’t even know if I would be good at dating now.”\n\n“I love soundcheck!” Swift says. At Spartanburg’s Memorial Auditorium, the back hallways are not as glamorous as atTRL: no Carey, no Ashanti, no Christina Ricci. But Swift hits the stage with redoubled enthusiasm. She genuinely loves most parts of her job, even standing around for hours signing thousands of autographs, but soundcheck seems to inspire a higher level of excitement. Swift and the band work up a new cover for the encore: “The Middle” by Jimmy Eat World, with a fiddle run taking the place of the guitar solo. Other non-country songs Swift has covered recently: Eminem’s “Lose Yourself,” Rihanna’s “Umbrella” and Def Leppard’s “Photograph.” That last one didn’t go over so well. “Kids born in ’92 don’t know it,” Swift says. “I’m apparently the only Eighties freak of my generation.”\n\nSwift retires to her bus. Later that night, she’ll have a crowd of two thousand, mostly teenage girls, screaming for her every move, but right now, she’s got more work to do. She efficiently autographs a big stack of CD booklets — her merchandise table offers the signed albums at the show. “It sells a lot more CDs,” she says, flashing a grin. “And I like being Number One.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Interview with Banjo Ben Clark by Janelle Landauer\n\nHow and when did your first break in the music industry come about?\n\nAs far as the Nashville scene goes, I would have to say it was when a friend from Texas recommended me for a Keith Urban audition days after I moved to town.  I didn’t get the gig, but I learned some really important lessons about the music biz and met some key people in the industry.\n\nWhat goals have you accomplished and what do you still hope to accomplish with your music career?\n\nWow…I’ve been really, really blessed.  I’ve toured and played for millions of fans, recorded on albums played and distributed worldwide, performed on most of the main national TV venues, and played on the mother stage of Country music… The Grand Old Opry.\n\nYou’ve had the opportunity to play on the Grand Ole Opry many times now… Can you talk more about those experiences?\n\nThe Opry is simply my favorite place to play.  I love history, and country music history in particular, so the Opry is the place for me!  When I first moved to town and was going through the typical pains of trying to make my rent payment each month, I actually worked at the gift shop in the Grand Ole Opry.  On my breaks, and sometimes when I wasn’t on break, I would sneak in to the auditorium and close my eyes…imagining playing on that stage one day.\n\nIf you could collaborate with anyone musically, who would it be and why?\n\nI think it would have to be Alison Krauss and Union Station.  Of course everyone loves Alison, but the guys in her band are some of my musical heroes, and to play with them while hearing Alison’s heavenly vocals would be…well, heaven.\n\nWhat advice would you give to those who plan to get into the music business?\n\nReally it’s like any other business that you would want to devote your life to…you have to LOVE it.  You can’t just like it, or just think it would be cool to make it, you have to be consumed with it and not take no for an answer.  And believe me, no matter who you are, you’re going to hear no at some time or another.  As a matter of fact, consider yourself extremely lucky if “no” is the worst thing you hear.\n\nWhat instruments do you play?\n\nI started playing piano at the age of four, and since I’ve picked up the guitar, banjo, mandolin, dobro, and fiddle.\n\nWhen did you start playing the banjo?\n\nI started playing the banjo my sophomore year of college at Texas A&M University.\n\nDo you have a certain brand of instruments that you prefer to play and would recommend to others?\n\nA lot of guys are endorsement hounds…I don’t happen to be one of those.  I like lots of different types and makes of instruments, and I don’t like to be tied down to one particular brand.  Sometimes I’ll pick up a $200 mandolin that absolutely sounds fabulous, and then play a $20,000 mandolin that I wouldn’t give $50 for!\n\nON THE ROAD\n\nWhat other artists have you played with in the past?\n\nI started out playing for an artist named Matt Jenkins.  Then, I went on an acoustic tour with an artist named Lila McCann.  From there I started playing piano and banjo for American Idol favorite, Josh Gracin.  That led to a position playing piano for Craig Morgan, and finally to my current position with Taylor Swift.\n\nDo you have any fond memories of being on the road with the artist(s) listed in the previous question?\n\nI would have to say one of my most favorite people to tour with would be Lila McCann.  Most of the time it was just she and I, and we had a blast acting stupid in the back of limos.  Since it was just the two of us, we got to have a lot more freedom in our travels.  A lot of times with bigger groups, the plans are more rigid, although Taylor makes sure we have a good time whenever we possibly can!\n\nON THE ROAD WITH TAYLOR SWIFT\n\nWhat instruments do you play on the road with Taylor?\n\nRight now I’m playing banjo, mandolin, dobro, and piano/organ.  Sometimes it changes based on what set we’re playing at the time.\n\nHow did you initially get in touch with Taylor and/or her crew for this touring position?\n\nActually they got in touch with me!  Taylor needed someone to “do what I do”, and I had toured with the drummer in Josh Gracin’s band.  He gave me a call one day to ask if I knew anyone else that played what I played, and I decided to take the position myself.\n\nIs this touring gig any different to you than any of your previous ones?\n\nYou mean besides having a teenage chick as my boss?  Actually it’s a lot different.  I would have to say that I’m being taken care of more on this gig than any other gig I’ve had.  Taylor is so in touch with what her group needs while away from their homes and families, and she does her very best to get us home as much as possible and not get burned out.  I’m so very thankful because getting burned out is an easy thing to do.\n\nWhat is your favorite song of Taylor’s to perform live?\n\nI would have to say it’s her recent release on the deluxe CD, “Perfectly Good Heart”.  It’s a time in the show where we “break it down”, pull out the stools and really get in touch with the audience.  Also, I get to play mandolin on this song, which is probably my favorite instrument to play on stage.\n\nDo you have a favorite memory of being on the road with Taylor and the other band members so far?\n\nSpeaking of Taylor doing things for us to make road-life as easy as possible, last summer Taylor took us all on vacation to the Grand Canyon. We got a privately guided Whitewater rafting trip down the Colorado River that runs through the canyon, then topped it off with a helicopter tour back out of the canyon.  One of my best memories ever!\n\nWhat do you like about touring? What do you dislike?\n\nI really like meeting fans.  It’s makes it worth it to see folks smile back at you from the stage and know that maybe you helped make the concert memorable for them.  Also, I really like to play golf, and we get to visit some of the coolest golf courses in North America!  I dislike being away from my wife, Hannah.  What’s hardest is that she loves to travel, and it’s really hard for me to see some of these places and not have her there to experience them with me.\n\nWhat do you like to do on the road in your free time?\n\nBelieve it or not, I love to practice on my instruments!  But when I have an opportunity to go hunting or fishing while I’m on the road, I never miss out!\n\nHave you worked on any new projects lately that you'd like to tell us about?\n\nActually I got to record some banjo on Taylor’s new record today!  I can’t say too much about it, but I can promise that her fans are not going to be disappointed!\n\nFinally, is there anything you would like to say to all the country music fans and all our readers?\n\nI think the main thing I’d like to say is that the fans are where it’s at.  Sometimes artists and musicians posses an attitude where they think they’re doing the fans a favor by playing for them.  I’m so fortunate to work for an artist and in a band that agrees with me in knowing that without the fans, we would be out of work…plain and simple.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Says Yes To \"No\"\n\nMay 19, 2008 — Sunday’s 43rd annual Academy of Country Music Awards provided some nice timing for Taylor Swift, who has a new single in circulation and got the chance to perform it on the show.\n\n\"Should’ve Said No\" is, like every other song on her debut album, written by Taylor, and it comes from an unfortunate chapter in her life.\n\n\"I wrote this song by myself, and it literally took me just 20 minutes to write before we recorded it,\" she says. \"I was living every line in this song at the time. I wrote this song about a guy who cheated on me who shouldn’t have.\"\n\nHer previous single, \"Picture To Burn,\" was also about a relationship that went bad, though Taylor says the two songs take different approaches to the topic.\n\n\"Picture To Burn\" has an \"angry and I’m-done-with-him attitude,\" she explains, while \"Should’ve Said No\" is \"more of a moral statement.\"\n\n\"It’s an ‘I love you, we were awesome and great together, but you messed this up and I would still be with you’ kinda thing,\" Taylor observes. \"You said yes, and you should’ve said no.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Taylor appears on the Maxim Hot 100 list, landing at No. 57. And she’s got plenty to celebrate, having won the Top New Female Vocalist honor at the ACMs.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Country singer Taylor Swift refuses to grow up too fast\n\nBy Beverly Keel – The Tennessean via GNS\nAlthough a tour with Brad Paisley forced Taylor Swift to skip her prom this spring, the high school junior is the belle of her own ball as she makes appearances across the country and in Canada in the coming months.\n\nThe 5-foot-11-inch blond stunner was nominated as top new female vocalist for the Academy of Country Music Awards earlier this month, though she lost to Miranda Lambert of “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” fame.\n\nHer self-titled debut album has been certified gold, and she recently nabbed a fan-voted 2007 Country Music Television Music Award for breakthrough video of the year for “Tim McGraw,” her Top 5 debut single and ode to young lost love that she penned. (The Hendersonville, Tenn., resident wrote or co-wrote every song on her album.) Before embarking on the current tour with Paisley, she opened for George Strait and Rascal Flatts.\n\n“Winning the CMT award was probably the most exciting night of my life to date,” Swift says. “I can’t explain the feeling. I had never been nominated for anything before. I had won nothing before, literally nothing.\n\n“To have my name called, I didn’t know what that was like. I didn’t think I was going to get it. When my name was called, I just ran up to the stage at, like, 100 miles an hour.”\n\nBut she thought the CMT win wouldn’t give her an edge over fellow ACM top new female vocalist nominees Lambert and former “American Idol” contestant Kellie Pickler, both of whom she readily praises.\n\n“They are very different,” she says of the awards. “CMT are fan-voted and the ACMS are your peers. I have never been someone who is presumptuous about anything.”\n\nSTILL A NORMAL GIRL\nSwift’s Hummer-driving mother dropped her leggy daughter off at a pizza place in Nashville, Tenn., on a recent afternoon.\n\nSwift looks like she just wrapped a cover shoot of Seventeen. Yet she appears to remain oblivious to the power of her looks or her growing fame as she hungrily downs a personal-sized pizza and excitedly reveals details of her ACM dress: a pink corseted outfit custom-made by Sandy Spika.\n\nDespite her red-carpet strolls and national television appearances, Swift contends she’s still a normal girl. She is home-schooled and completes many of her assignments on the bus.\n\n“I’ll graduate by the time my regular class graduates,” she says. “I could blow through it and graduate in a couple of months, but for me, I am not in a hurry. I don’t hate it that much.”\n\nSwift relishes every moment of being 17, a feeling evident in her lyrics, image, dress and videos.\n\nUnlike some pop stars, Swift sticks to songs that convey teenage innocence, such as an unrequited crush in “Teardrops on My Guitar.” She doesn’t wear revealing clothes — she’s almost always seen in a flowing feminine dress and cowboy boots — or look like she’s heading to (or from) a bar.\n\n“I will be the first one to stand up and say, ‘I am 17,’ ” she says. “This is what I have to bring to the table. I have never been in a hurry to be 25.\n\n“One day, I’ll look back on being 17 and wish I had lived a little more as 17. Maybe I am wrong, but I don’t feel it is uncool to be 17 in the business world. Not many people treat me like I am 17. They give me the ability to have creative freedom and power to put the music out there. That’s why I am not self-conscious about my age.”\n\n \n\nPEERS ARE PLEASED\nHer coming-of-age music has obviously struck a nerve with young listeners. Her music has been streamed more than 14 million times on MySpace, and “Tim McGraw” has sold more than 500,000 digital downloads.\n\nEarly on, Swift recognized the power of MySpace through her friends’ use. Since she didn’t have a personal page, she established a MySpace music page and had fans listening to her music before a single was selected.\n\n“I nurtured it and really paid attention to it, like it was something important and not just a marketing tool,” she says.\n\nShe personally wrote her bio in first-person instead of running the standard third-person, which she thought would make her seem cold and impersonal.\n\n“I wrote it about who I am as a person,” Swift says. “I have never been afraid to let people in to see that part of me, that I actually am a human being.\n\n“It’s cool because my fans are all ages. Of course, there are a lot of them that are my age. That is so flattering to me because I know how picky I am about music and how picky my friends are about music. They are ruthless. But if they like something, they are so passionate and loyal. That is why I am so happy to have fans that are my age.”\n\n \n\nMOMS LOVE HER, TOO\nIt’s a good bet that those fans’ mothers are thrilled that their daughters are fans of Swift, an impressively well spoken and intelligent artist who discusses responsibility and morals as easily as she tackles fashion and fame.\n\nIt’s not that Swift isn’t tempted by the same choices that face other teenage girls, but that she realizes the ramifications of such indulgences. After all, this is a teenage girl who is paid to play in bars where she’s surrounded by alcohol-guzzling adults.\n\n“As long as I am playing music, I am fine,” she says. “I don’t go into bars if I am not playing music. That isn’t my place right now in my life.\n\n“I’ve been very lucky that people treated me so well and realized my morals and what I will and won’t do. I have a really good core group of people around me that enforce that.”\n\nWhen faced with a major decision, such as whether to drink or smoke or choose an outfit for a major event, she envisions a 6-year-old girl sitting in the front row of one of her concerts and what the girl would think if she saw Swift engaging in such behavior.\n\n“I think about her mother. Would her mother let her listen to my music if she saw me do this?” Swift asks. “That is the easiest way to make decisions for me because it completely clears up any clouds that my judgment might have. I am not going to let those people down.\n\n“I have asked for this; I wanted it. Yes, there is pressure sometimes, but I have wanted this. I am going to respect people who have trusted me with their kids.”\n\nTHE TAYLOR SWIFT FILE\nAge: 17\n\nBorn: Dec. 13, 1989, in Wyomissing, Pa.\n\nHome: Hendersonville, Tenn.\n\nEducation: A high school junior who went to Hendersonville High until last year but is now home schooled.\n\nDebut album: “Taylor Swift”\n\nFun fact: Her maternal grandmother was a professional opera singer.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift signs, and signs, and signs\n\nBy BEVERLY KEEL • June 8, 2008\n\nTaylor Swift signed autographs for eight hours without taking a single break on Saturday at the Nashville Convention Center, holding the longest CMA Music Festival signing since Garth Brooks’ 23-hour session in 1996.\n\nShe signed nearly 900 autographs, staying two more hours than originally planned.\n\nWhen she finished and was told she had signed for eight hours, she exclaimed, “It didn’t feel like it!” Then she said, ‘That was almost nine, right? I’m saying nine.”\n\n“After you sign autographs for nine hours, it’s almost like you feel like you’ve never ever understood more why you do this than right in that moment. Because you see all these little 5-year-olds that know all the words to your songs and then there’s the grandmother that comes through that’s telling you a story that almost brings you to tears. It’s like you understand exactly why you wanted to do this in the first place.”\n\nShe admitted that her calves ached. “Everyone is coming through going, ‘Your arm must be hurting.’ But I play guitar, so it’s that same exact motion. My arm has never bothered me after signing.” \n\nShe won’t get much rest because she films a cameo in the Hannah Montana movie on Monday. “I’m really excited about it. I’m not playing a part; it’s just me singing in a bar.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Taylor SWIFT\nAGE 18 HOMETOWN: WYOMISSING, PA\nThe Phenomenon\n\n\"I'm not Paris Hilton!\" Taylor Swift jokingly shouts from a bench in Manhattan's Central Park. While she's waiting for the photographer to set up for her CosmoGirl cover shoot, a class of rowdy third-graders on a field trip notice a celebrity in their midst, mistakenly concluding that the tall blond girl in the short black dress must be the infamous heiress. The fact is. Taylor is about as different from Paris as you can get. Despite her superstar status, she doesn't party, she still lives with her family, and she's more comfortable in her flat, fringed booties than in Prada pumps. Actually, Taylor has always known who she was meant to be.\nAt 10, she combined her love of country music with her natu ral vocal talent and started singing at local festivals. At 11, she begged her par ents to take her to Nashville-almost 800 miles away-so she could hand demo tapes of her sing ing to record label receptionists. An underwhelming response only made her work harder to find the thing that would set her apart: not only playing, but writing her own songs. By age 12, Taylor was taking regular trips to Nashville to work with song-writers, and two years later, her family-with younger brother\nAustin in tow-moved there so she could further her career. It paid off big-time. In 2006, at age 16, she was signed by the independent Big Machine Records, which released her self- titled debut. At 17, she became the youngest person to write and sing a number one country single (\"Our Song\"). All five of her singles earned Top 10 status on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and Top 40 status on the Hot 100, and the album went triple platinum. Unlike the racy lyrics of other hot artists, Taylor's songs are refreshingly real and from the heart, which could be why she has connected so deeply with an audience of all ages-including people who aren't country music fans.Continuing her streak of success, she just released her new album, Fearless. The first single, \"Love Story,\" is already a hit, sug- gesting another blockbuster year to come. But Taylor isn't just making her mark in music-she's forging a path in the world of philanthropy too, whether she's teaming with Tennessee's governor to fight Internet predators or donating $100,000 to lowa flood relief efforts. When Taylor accepts her many music awards and mentions how grateful she is, it's not just lip service. It's proof that working hard and sharing the spoils of your success are the true makings of a superstar.\n\n\"I was that annoying kid who ran around singing for random strangers. Music was always it for me. When I was 9, I saw a TV show about Faith Hill and how she made it in country music, and she talked about Nashvile. So I looked up Nashville and leamed it was this amazing city where country music lived. I was like. That's the promsed land of country music. That's where I need to go! The thing that Nashville taught me then was that an 11-year-old girl who sings songs other people have written is more common than you'd think. How was I going to make myself different? That's what I had to figure out. When I was 12. a family friend taught me three chords\non the guitar. That same day, I wrote my first song and I found what could make me different. Discovering songwriting put me into overdrive. It was exhilarating.\"\n\n\"Writing my own songs gives me the ability to vent. For some people, they like to paint. Others like to shop and buy the cutest pair of shoes, and 'the art they get to wear on their feet. For me, it's writing. I love writing about past relationships because it justifies them. If I dated somebody and it didn't work out and it hurt, and I write a song that goes Top 10 because of it-that relationship was totally worth it, you know? Still, you don't imagine when you're writing a song in your living room that it's going to go out in the world and affect somebody you've never met. It's amazing when my fans tell me my song helped them move on from a relationship or made their day better. My fans are so important to me, and I would love for them to grow up with me. But I never want to throw anyone for a loop or change so much that people can't recognize me. The songs I've written for my new album are at a different place than they were when I wrote my first album, and I'm looking forward to experiencing more in life and being able to translate that into new songs.\"\n\n\"When a mom says to me, 'You're an incredible role model for my daughter,\" that's the best compliment you could give me because it's about my character, which to me is the biggest honor, I always try to oper ate by the standards that I set for myself, because those standards are the hardest to beat. I love giving back to people because it's sort of like when you're look ing forward to Christmas-not because you're going to get presents, but because you've gotten your mom something really cool and you can't wait to see her face when she opens it.\"\n\n\"The best advice that I've ever gotten was one little thing Faith Hill told me. At the Country Music Awards, I was in these awesome high-heeled shoes but they really hurt, I was going up to present an award, and I whispered to Faith, 'My feet hurt so bad! She goes, \"Take 'em off!\" I was like, well, Faith Hill told me to, so I took off my shoes and carried them in my hand. She taught me that I don't have to take everything so seriously.\"\n\n\"My song Fearless is about an incredible first date when all your walls are coming down and you are fearlessly jumping into love\"\n\nBTS\nWe take you behind the scenes of this month's cover shoot.\nPhoto shoot call time: 9 am \nTaylor's actual time of arrival: 9 a.m. \nLocation: New York City's Central Park \nWeather: cloudy with a slight drizzle \nWhat she was wearing on arrival: blue gym shorts and a yellow T-shirt from Forever 21 (\"I love my $20 out- fit!\"), brown fringed suede boots, and braided bracelets \nWho came with her: her publicist, har four manager, and her mom \nWhat she ate: a Nathan's hot dog with extra ketchup \nHer special request: soft-serve ice cream with rainbow sprinkles-but she didn't have time to eat it \nTunes played at the shoot: She requested New York's Z100 radio station, which played \"I Kissed A Girl by Katy Perry.\n\n\"MY NEWEST HOBBY IS GOING TO WAL-MART AND PUTTING MY CD IN FRONT OF OTHERS IN THE RACK.

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood Fill the Wisconsin Air With Country Music\nCountry Thunder USA Opens With Girls' Night Out\nJuly 17, 2008; Written by Alison Bonaguro\n\nTWIN LAKES, Wis. -- There must have been some mistake. Clearly, Taylor Swift should have been the headliner at Country Thunder USA's opening night. And yet Carrie Underwood somehow ended up on stage at the end of the night instead.\n\nIt's not that Underwood can't sing, perform or attract an audience. Those facts are undeniable. But Swift was, by far, the Wisconsin festival's main attraction Wednesday (July 16). She owned the stage, the crowd and the entire sundown performance. And in her typical fan-appreciation mode, she stayed past closing time to sign autographs for the hundreds of fans willing to miss Underwood to wait in line to meet Swift.\n\nBut for those who stayed in their seats and/or lawn chairs to watch Underwood's set, she certainly gave them plenty to listen to. Her set was just over an hour, but that was time enough to check off almost all of her radio hits. Clad in a short satin jumpsuit and thigh-high black boots, she opened with two rockers, \"Flat on the Floor\" and \"Wasted,\" and went on to pick up an electric guitar to accompany herself on \"Get Out of This Town.\" If those elements didn't feel very country, she did give the fans little glimpses of that girl from Checotah, Okla. Like when she introduced \"The More Boys I Meet\" by telling the crowd, \"If you can't find Mr. Right, do what I did and get yourself a cute little puppy.\"\n\n\"Jesus Take the Wheel,\" \"Don't Forget to Remember Me\" and even her newest single \"Last Name\" all turned into fan singalongs before she ended her show with \"Before He Cheats.\"\n\nSwift had a few singalongs of her own during her 90-minute set. But it was her spontaneity and enthusiasm that fueled her energetic show. What Swift lacks in years she makes up for with her crowd rapport. And her distinctive voice that has been vaguely criticized by some in the music industry only seems to be getting better with time.\n\nDressed simply in a black glitter tank dress and cowboys boots, Swift's only rock 'n' roll moment of the night might've been her blinged-out acoustic guitar. She played it throughout the night, putting it down a few times to work the catwalk or let her six-man band shine. At one point during the feisty \"Should've Said No,\" Swift and her fiddle player exchanged their strings for drumsticks and beat the hell out of a trash can as a sort of percussive anger management.\n\nThe sincere stories she tells about each song remind you just how young she is, but even young girls can have deep raw emotions. Musing about the song, \"The Outside,\" she said, \"I wrote this one at a time in my life when I didn't get to look out and see all your beautiful faces. I wrote this about being lonely, and I don't feel lonely anymore.\"\n\nA new trend in country seems to be trading in old, tired covers of the most obvious Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard songs and upping the cool quotient with rock and R&B; covers. To that end, Swift did an acoustic take on Rihanna's melodic \"Take a Bow.\" She also treated the audience to one new song, \"Change,\" which has an anthem feel to it -- which may be why it was chosen to be part of this year's Olympics broadcast.\n\nBefore Swift's appearance, there was a showing of quality country rookies and veterans. In fact, Country Thunder's first of four nights had possibly its strongest lineup, perhaps as an attempt to prove to the world that the music festival is still viable after low ticket sales and other financial woes forced the cancellation of a similar event in Dallas in May. Country Thunder USA presented a successful four-day festival in Arizona in April, but music industry insiders say the rising cost of gasoline is causing fans to become more selective in traveling to concerts this summer. Judging from the lighter-than-normal crowd at Wednesday's show, attendance was so sparse that entire sections of seats were left stacked because there was no demand for them.\n\nJoe Nichols did his best to entertain the earlybirds, though. Starting out with his well-known solid country tunes like \"Size Matters\" and \"The Impossible,\" he reminded people exactly who he was. His voice was at its purest for \"She Only Smokes When She Drinks.\" And even though it's not his hit -- or even a country hit -- the crowd seemed to enjoy his cover of Nickelback's \"Rockstar.\" The irony of Nichols singing a song about wanting a life where \"the girls come easy and the drugs come cheap\" after having just spent time in rehab didn't seem to bother anyone.\n\nLady Antebellum, the Academy of Country Music's reigning top new duo or vocal group, never fails to rock country fans. Whether they are headlining their own club show or singing to a meager festival crowd, they put their collective hearts in it. And the way Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott take turns on lead vocals, sometimes even within a song, always keeps their show fresh. The harmonies on \"Love's Lookin' Good on You\" were textbook perfect, and Kelley's soulful pipes never wavered.\n\nThe earliest slot in the lineup went to Laura Bryna, who put on a sweet show with a stellar seven-man band. Her short set highlighted songs off her debut album, the best by far being \"According to the Radio\" which was written by a Country Thunder old-timer, Keith Urban.\n\nCountry Thunder USA continues Thursday night (July 17) with Dierks Bentley, Miranda Lambert, Emerson Drive, Keith Anderson and Ashton Shepherd. The festival runs through Saturday.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Swift receives her high school diploma, in mail\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- While most of her peers donned caps and gowns to receive their high school diplomas, country star Taylor Swift was strumming a guitar and performing for thousands of fans.\n\nSo Swift got her diploma in the mail.\n\n\"Education has always been at the forefront of my priorities, so I'm really glad to have my diploma,\" the 18-year-old singer-songwriter told The Associated Press on Friday.\n\nSwift attended public school for 9th and 10th grade. But when her career began heating up, she needed more flexibility and switched to Aaron Academy, a private Christian school that offers home schooling.\n\n\"I never expected that my senior year would go the way it has,\" she said. \"There's something really exciting about getting to live your dream and continue your education at the same time.\"",

In the meantime, she joins Taylor and Julianne Hough Sept. 8 to co-host the ABC special CMA Music Festival: Country’s Night To Rock. Others on the two-hour telecast include Trace Adkins, Alan Jackson, Dwight Yoakam and Lady Antebellum.",

      "Transcript/Content": "HOT DISH: Taylor Swift Happy With Her Atypical Teenage Life\n\nBy Hazel Smith 08.04.08\n\nMost high school grads received their diploma while wearing caps and gowns, but not Taylor Swift. While Taylor’s Hendersonville, Tenn., classmates were receiving theirs, she was onstage someplace playing guitar and singing. So she got her diploma in the mail. She attended the ninth and 10th grade at a public high school, but when her career took off, she switched to a private Christian school that offers homeschooling. \n\nWhen I heard the 18-year old Taylor received her diploma from the postman, I wondered if she felt she missed out by not graduating with her high school class.\n\n“I feel like I had the best senior year I could have had,” she says. “I don’t feel at all that I was ripped off.”\n\nPeers are so important to teens, and Taylor keeps in close contact with her longtime pal, Abigail.\n\n“Abigail was my best friend all through school and is still my very best friend,” Taylor says, adding that Abigail sometimes goes on the road with her. Those trips will likely be more difficult to schedule in the future, however. Taylor explains, “Abigail is going to college, and her schooling will keep her busy.” \n\nTaylor and Miley Cyrus are friends, too, although she notes, “But we don’t have a chance to hang out. I’m either busy on the road or at home in Hendersonville. And Miley is busy in California.”\n\nAmong her other friends, Taylor says, “I’m really close with Kellie Pickler. We call and chat. She’s so much fun. We wrote a song together when we were opening shows for Brad Paisley. The song we wrote is on Kellie’s new CD. Kellie was going through some personal issues and told me about it, and we wrote about it. We may write together again.” \n\nFYI: Taylor says to tell everyone that she is friends with all three of the Jonas Brothers — not just one! ",

The finger-snappers at the end of Hey Stephen have a surname familiar to country fans.\n\n\"That's Martina McBride's kids,\" Swift says. \"We were recording in her husband's studio, and they were hanging out.

      "Transcript/Content": "Teen star Taylor Swift blazes country music trails\n\nBy Bobby Reed 08.07.08 \n\nCountry music hit-maker Taylor Swift has done everything right so far. At a time when the music industry is scrambling for ways to sell albums, this blond, business-minded teenager is showing her older musical peers exactly how it can be done.\n\nReleased by the independent label Big Machine Records in October 2006, Swift’s self-titled debut has sold more than 3 million copies. During the last two years, few acts in any genre of music can match that.\nIndustry insiders who glanced at the Aug. 2 edition of Billboard’s Top Country Albums chart noticed a highly unusual occurrence: Swift held the top two spots. Her new EP, “Beautiful Eyes,” debuted at No. 1, while her self-titled disc was at No. 2 — still selling strong after 91 weeks on the chart. The remarkable feat of holding the top two spots on this chart was last accomplished in 1997 by LeAnn Rimes.\n\nSwift has spent the summer giving concert performances and recording her third album, slated for release in November. When Swift opens for Rascal Flatts in Tinley Park on Saturday night, she is likely to sing “Change,” a song from the forthcoming CD.\n\n“I feel like I’ve put everything that I have, and every part of me, into this album,” Swift said during a phone call from Hendersonville, Tenn., where she lives with her parents. “I can’t wait for the fans to hear this album. I’m so proud of it.”\n\nComplete details about the CD aren’t available yet, but the disc will include the new song “Breathe,” co-written by pop star Colbie Caillat (“Bubbly”), who contributes backing vocals to the track.\n\nGolden, yet grounded\nSo what makes Swift the golden girl of the moment? A complex combination of factors that Nashville executives now strive to emulate — or at least use as a learning experience for the development of other acts.\n\nMarketers love the fact that Swift, 18, appeals to a young demographic, selling CDs to people who are her own age — and their parents, as well. A prolific songwriter, Swift composes her own material — a rarity for an artist so young. She landed a songwriting contract at age 14, and she recorded her debut when she was 16.\n\nRadio programmers have embraced Swift’s hooky singles, like the chart-topper “Our Song.” She is the only solo female act in the history of the Billboard country singles charts to score five Top 10 singles from a debut album.\n\nThis sudden flood of fame apparently has not unduly twisted Swift’s young ego. \n\n“The most interesting thing I’ve realized about my life is that you just continue being the same person,” she said. “There are so many things that are different [now]. You get to fly in private planes. You get play in front of thousands of people. You get to live your dream. But then you come home, and you’ve still got the same best friend that you had in eighth grade. When you go to a high school football game, you still feel like your hair is frizzy and people are laughing at you. And you still have all those same insecurities that you had when you were 10 years old. I think it’s really fun to just stay the same person, and have the world around you change, and have the perception of you change.”\n\nUnlike many teenage celebrities, Swift has not generated any tawdry tabloid fodder. Maintaining a clean image is important in mainstream country music, an industry that still sells products aimed at the entire family.\n\n“I never was a partier in high school, and I’ve never been a partier in my career, either,” Swift said. “I’ve always wanted to stay out of trouble. My parents mean the world to me, so I never wanted to let them down.”\n\nOnline, in stores, mobile\nAnother key to Swift’s success is that fans are discovering and consuming her music in multifaceted ways. The “Beautiful Eyes” package is a two-disc collection of audio and video tracks sold exclusively at Wal-Mart. While Swift is a hit with brick-and-mortar retailers, she’s also a huge presence in the online world.\n\nAt press time, Swift’s single “Should’ve Said No” was No. 2 on the iTunes list of top country songs, No. 4 on the list of top videos streamed at the Country Music Television Web site CMT.com and No. 6 on Billboard’s country singles chart. A visit to her MySpace page reveals that the total number of song plays streamed there has surpassed 53 million. Swift also has received a Gold mastertone certification for selling more than 500,000 ringtones of “Our Song.”\n\nAttention, shoppers\nOn one hand, Swift is a glamorous jet-setter, on the other she remains a typical teenager. A blog entry she posted July 18 on MySpace says it all: “Today was a travel day for us, and I begged my tour manager to let us stop to shop in Denver. So we went to the mall. Yessss. Shoes.”\n\nDuring her conversation with the Sun-Times, Swift explained that something as simple as shopping for ballet flats in a shoe store can turn into an impromptu meet-and-greet session with eager fans. But she wasn’t complaining.\n\n“I’m lucky to have those people asking for my autograph,” she said. “It’s part of what I do. Sometimes it gets to the point where you just can’t shop, and you have to deal with that. I accept it and embrace it because that’s the life I’ve always wanted. And I want it so bad still.”",

Besides a booming music career and a part in the Hannah Montana movie, the American Idol alum just finished signing autographs for 8 hours.\n\n“I think the most memorable story [I heard] was when somebody said when they were going through a breakup, your song motivated them to get back in the game, and they give you the credit for that,” Swift says.  “Or they heard my song and picked up a guitar and started writing songs and now have a way to channel their emotions.  Things like that really move me.”\n\nThe blonde beauty, who tells OK! that when she does have down time she likes to paddle out on a surfboard to a cove on the lake near her home in Tennessee, says she recently treated herself to a custom tour bus (rumored to cost $1 million!)\n\n“It was rather expensive,” she confesses, “I’m not sure that it was quite $1 million but it was pretty up there.  I got a custom-made tour bus with a fireplace, a pull-down treadmill, all kinds of cool stuff.  It’s got hardwood floors.”\n\nShe adds, “I had to have it because that’s what I live on .  The majority of my time is spent on the road, and when I’m out there you want to be comfortable and feel like you’re home.”\n\nTaylor, who first started writing songs when she was twelve, says she often uses music as a way to channel her own emotions.  Some might even call it a rebellious side.\n\n“I think everybody has a little bit of rebellion in them, but for me, it comes out in my songs,” she says.  “My rebellion is writing a song about a guy and putting his name in a song.” \n\nSo who would Taylor’s dream duet be?\n\n“John Mayer!” She exclaims. “He’s got such a unique voice that people would definitely be able to tell that it was him on the track.”\n\nWatch out Jennifer Aniston!

      "Transcript/Content": "\"NOSE pressed up against glass is how Taylor Swift, 18, has gotten all of her best material. “I was an outsider at school,” she said. “When I go back, I feel like my hair’s frizzy and people are laughing at me. It’s still the middle-school insecurity thing.”\n\nMs. Swift’s self-titled debut album, released in 2006, detailed that experience in diaristic fashion, with incriminating names and details left intact. The result was a small masterpiece of pop-minded country, both wide-eyed and cynical, held together by Ms. Swift’s firm, pleading voice. Her best songs _x0097_ “Picture to Burn,” “Should’ve Said No” _x0097_ were a little vicious too, animated by something sharper than traditional teenage angst.\n\nThe album remains in the Top 5 of the Billboard country-album chart, spawned five Top 10 country singles and has sold more than three million copies. So perhaps that’s why “Fearless” (Big Machine), scheduled for release on Nov. 11, is, Ms. Swift said, “a continuation.” Like the hit “Teardrops on My Guitar,” the sassy “You Belong to Me” is about pining for a boy who sees you only as a friend. And the rootsy “15” is a cautionary tale:\n\nIn your life you’ll do things greater\nThan dating the boy on the football team\nBut I didn’t know it at 15.\n\n“I had a goal to not get out of touch, to not write things I can’t relate to,” she said. “I don’t think my mind-set has changed.”\n\nIf there’s anything disingenuous about the new songs, it’s that Ms. Swift’s entire life has been thrown into upheaval in the last two years: the outsider has become the insider. In the past few months alone, she’s been nominated for an MTV Video Music Award, almost unheard of for a country artist; been hounded by pop-star-size gossip (romantically linked to Joe Jonas of the Jonas Brothers, a connection she denies); and signed a deal with Jakks Pacific, which makes Pokémon toys, for a line of Taylor Swift fashion dolls to be released this fall.\n\n“Later on there will definitely be a huge temptation for me to make an alt-country record, something edgier and a little darker,” Ms. Swift said. But for now she’ll stick with what she knows, or knew: “songs that can be some sort of consolation for what people my age go through.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Teen Spirit: Taylor Swift, Songwriting Superstar\n\nTaylor Swift strums her way into celebrity, is crowned a country queen, and proves to be a songwriting superstar\nIn Celebrity, October 1, 2008\nBY VICTORIA BRADLEY\n\nThe hot sun, like a fried egg, sinks behind the black silhouetted trees that surround Post-Gazette Pavilion.\nThe air smells like cigarettes and warm pretzels and is heavy with a swelling of screams, punctuated by the gravel kicks of cowboy boots. Quick paces over the grassy hill of the great lawn, where night has already fallen, and the cool blue of 10,000-something cell phones glows like fireflies over the crowd, whose shrieks sweeten into a serenade. They sing along with the curly- haired blonde, so small on the stage below, as she croons to the song that made her famous: \"When you think Tim McGraw... I hope you think my favorite song... someday you'll turn Pittsburgh radio on...\" The crowd roars.\nTaylor Swift comes a long way from the 10-acre Christmas tree farm in Sinking Spring, Pa., where she lived as a kid. \"Growing up in Pennsylvania was awesome,\" she says on a phone call from her tour bus. \"I wouldn't change one thing about my childhood. We had horses and a million cats, and my brother had a huge dirt pile that we played in. Those are the memories I have of growing up in Pennsylvania, having a lot of room to run, wideopen spaces.\nWhen Swift is in the fourth grade, her family moves to Wyomissing, where the 9-year-old gets a craving for the stage, instilled by an opera singing grandma. \"I played Sandy in Grease,\" she says. \"I was an orphan in Annie and did Bye Bye Birdie and The Sound of Music. And, you know, I started to realize that what I looked forward to the most was the afterparties, where they had a karaoke machine set up, and I could sing country music.\"\nSwift develops her twang to tunes by country superstars The Dixie Chicks, Sheryl Crow, LeAnn Rimes, Shania Twain, and Faith Hill. Her dad, Scott, indulges her karaoke dreams by taking her to The Pat Garrett Roadhouse in Strausstown, where songsters compete for a shot at the opening act slot at the adjoining amphitheater. An 11-year old Swift wins with a passionate version of LeAnn Rimes's \"Big Deal\" and gets her first gig, singing before the Charlie Daniels show.\nThinking she has hit the big time, Swift convinces her parents to take her to Nashville for spring break. \"We stayed at the Holiday Inn, rented a car, and drove down Music Row,\" Swift says. \"I would walk into all these record labels and give them a demo CD of me singing karaoke songs and ask them for a record deal. That's when I realized that I needed to be more. I needed to know how to do something more than just sing a song.\nSwift is on to something: the talent that would amount to her greatness in the industry as a songwriting phenom. A year later, Swift learns to play the guitar. Ronnie Kramer, a family friend, comes over to fix the household computer and teaches Swift her first three chords. That day, the young talent writes her first song, \"Lucky You.\" The next week, Kramer comes back to teach her three more chords, and then three more, until Swift is writing a song a day and churning out a new demo this time, it's original. \"And it was not good,\" Swift says bluntly.\n\"There are people around Pennsylvania with little vintage. CDs. Get ready to hear the chipmunk voice.\" Today, that little vintage chipmunk CD goes for a hot $180 on eBay, but Pittsburgh's own Frank Bell has had his copy for years. The vice president of programming for Froggy-FM meets Scott Swift in 1977 when the two work together at WHUM, a little AM country station in Reading, Pa. The guys keep in touch, and later, after Bell has moved to Pittsburgh and Swift is working for Merrill Lynch, the proud father sends indie recordings to his friend in the industry. \"I said, 'I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I don't think anyone will play these, Bell says of Swift's original songs. He says the sugary bubblegum sound of her first takes wasn't appreciated in a country market that was still looking for the weathered sounds of middle-aged artists. Still, Bell can't ignore Swift's natural ability for songwriting. \"I hesitate to use the phrase 'freak factor,\" he says, \"but that's really what it is. It's hard to compare anyone to Taylor. And, it's the writing. She's so young to be writing all of her own material, and she's truly an old soul.\nShe's probably the most talented singer-songwriter in any genre to come along in recent memory. He pops in a video of Swift, standing in front of her Christmas tree at 12 years old. She's sockstepping on her faded jeans, strumming a guitar that's too big for her, and singing a song that's as high-pitched as it is simply lyric'ed. But she's making absolute eye contact with the camera, squinting and smiling like a country music veteran. The video is actually a compilation, a gem that Bell pulls together from all of the tapes Swift's father had sent over the years, a gift for the star's 18th birthday. There's a clip of her perched in her bedroom singing \"Beautiful Day,\" a song she wrote about her two best friends at the time, who were dating. She gets silly and sings a jingle she wrote for Subway, confessing to serious sandwich cravings as a kid. In another clip, Swift is sitting in her living room singing \"Smokey Black Nights,\" a song that ends up on her first demo. She sustains composure when a cat comes into the frame and licks her strumming fingers.\nWith the start of some songwriting chops, the Swifts start peddling Taylor's demos again. This time RCA Records shows interest, offering the eighth grader a development deal. So, the whole family moves to Nashville. \"If God blesses your family with a Tiger Woods, you're going to move where you can golf all the time,\" Bell says. In November of 2004, Swift performs a showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe and catches the attention of seasoned vet Scott Borchetta, who has worked with Toby Keith and Randy Travis. He launches his own record company, Big Machine Records, hinging on the success of a 14-year-old girl and her guitar. \"From our very first meeting, I've thought that Taylor was an extraordinary talent, Borchetta says. That was four years ago, when she was just 14. I've never thought of her as a little girl. She's always been just an incredible young artist to me. I've had very aggressive plans for Taylor since day one.\"\nDespite industry advice to release a more pop-rock country jam, Borchetta chooses \"Tim McGraw as Swift's first single in August 2006. His decision is solidified as the single swings Swift into super stardom, and she sells 3 million copies of her first album and celebrates five Top 10 hits. She makes history at the 42nd Annual Academy of Country Music Awards in Las Vegas when she steps off the stage to sing her first single to the country idol who inspired it. When it's over, the giddy girl shakes his hand and grins a true teenage smile over her shoulder. \"That's Tim McGraw! That's Tim McGraw!\" she squeals.\nIt's Froggy and Swift's old friend, Frank Bell, who brings the star back to Pittsburgh for the first time in September 2006 to open for Lonestar. The next day, she belts out the national anthem at a Pittsburgh Steelers game, solidifying her local celebrity. She returns in 2007 on three separate occasions to open for George Strait in February, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill in July, and Brad Paisley in August. Later, when \"Our Song\" earns heavy radio rotation, Swift becomes the youngest country star in history to write her own No. 1 song. Months later, she makes history again, winning the Country Music Association's Horizon Award, an industry salute given to an artist who has truly arrived on the scene. The accomplishment is so moving that Borchetta is seen crying. Swift, in tears too, grips her award and thanks her fans for changing her life. \"This is definitely the highlight of my senior year,\" she sniffles, \"Winning the CMA Horizon was absolutely the surprise and the best night of my life,\" she says later, on the phone. \"All of the people at my record label that night were crying, and I got to see that record label go from a building with fresh paint on the walls and no furniture and 12 employees to having their artist win the CMA Horizon Award. I didn't think of it so much as, 'I won this.' I thought about it like, This team won this.\"\nThat night, Taylor writes the emotional and inspiring song, \"Change,\" an anthem that would end up on the soundtrack for the 2008 Olympic games and her upcoming album, Fearless, due out November 11. Local country artist, songwriter, and producer Bob Corbin says that Swift changed the scene of country music forever. \"The fact that Taylor Swift broke on an independent label is unheard of,\" Corbin says. \"Most labels don't know where the next phase is going to be. The industry has changed a lot from the way it used to be, even five years ago. There's a little more room for everyone..... and a lot of different styles.\"\nCorbin speaks to the vast appeal of Taylor Swift, referencing her crossover into the pop charts, luring fans into the country scene who wouldn't have vested interested before. He also credits Western Pennsylvania for its rich and fertile country market. \"Pittsburgh itself is a city of neighborhoods, a lot of small towns grouped together,\" he says. \"It's a big step to cross the rivers here, but if you can go 40 miles outside of Pittsburgh in any direction it's country.\" Bell agrees. \"This is a shot- and-a beer area,\" he says. \"There's a good work ethic. People say what they mean and mean what they say. And there's so much hometown talent here that country music really thrives.\" Swift says that this region will always gravitate toward country music. \"You know, it must be the people.\nPittsburgh just seems like a very passionate town. It seems like when they love something, they're gonna stand by it. And I love that.\" Thousands of Pennsylvania's passionate country people, in ripped jeans and cowboy hats, sway and sing along with their own Swift. When she plucks the last pretty notes of her McGraw mantra, the drum tempo quickens, and the young star starts shuffling her black boots to the new beat. She dances, her sparkly dress bouncing light that matches her cobalt blue eyes. \"Y'all it's so good to be with you tonight, but I gotta tell ya, if you break my heart or mess with my friends from my home state of Pennsylvania!\" The crowd screams, and Swift pauses to giggle and then huffs: \"I'm gonna write a song about you.\" Swift breaks into a bold and beautiful \"Picture to Burn,\" strutting across the stage to the sassy plucking of a banjo. Country's young queen is home. She performs for a sold-out crowd but dances with the youthful rebellion of a little girl dancing around her living room in faded jeans and socks.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Exit Interview: Taylor Swift\nWyomissing’s country-music superstar releases her sophomore album, Fearless, this month\n\nBy Richard Rys· 10/21/2008, 12:09 p.m.\n\nIn case you wouldn’t know Tim McGraw from a McNugget, here’s what Taylor Swift will have accomplished before she turns 19 next month: released a triple-platinum first album, made the Guinness Book of Records as the first million-selling female in the U.S. to write her debut release, and never took a “vacation” to rehab or posed nude. Swift checked in from the road to discuss her new album and indulged us with talk about mean girls, the King of Prussia mall, and some guy named Jonas.\n\nTell me about this legendary Christmas tree farm you grew up on. It was an actual Christmas tree farm. We had, like, 15 acres. It was really fun as a kid. I also spent my summers at the Jersey Shore, on the bay in Stone Harbor. I walked everywhere barefoot. It was just the most amazing, magical way to grow up.\n\nDo you remember the first song you wrote? A song called “Lucky You,” when I was 12. There’s a terrible recording of it that leaked on the Internet. I sound like a Chipmunk.\n\nI understand the King of Prussia mall comforted you at a very tough time in your life. Can you explain? In middle school, my friends decided I was weird, and they didn’t like my hair. They ditched me and talked behind my back, which is cool — I’m over it. [laughs] One time I called them and said, “Hey, do you want to go to the Berkshire Mall?” They all gave me excuses and said no. So I go to the mall with my mom, and don’t you know, we run into all of them. Together. Shopping. My mom could see I was about to cry, so she said, “You know what? We’re going to the King of Prussia mall,” which was the mecca.\n\nIn a way, you owe those bitches some thanks for giving you good material. Exactly. The thing about being a songwriter is that no matter what happens, if you write a song about it, it’s productive.\n\nWas the transition from your tree farm to Nashville difficult? It was easy. In Pennsylvania, I was weird. I would play singer-songwriter nights every weekend instead of going to parties. I think it’s weird to go to parties and get drunk when you’re 13, but whatever. Then I moved to Nashville, and all of the sudden I was a normal kid.\n\nWhen did you realize that you weren’t just successful — you were a humongous friggin’ deal? [pause] Um, I never came to that realization, actually. My biggest pet peeve is people who feel they’re entitled to success and fame. I haven’t reached the point where I’m like, “Hey, man, I’ve made it!” And I hope I never do get to that point.\n\nHere’s my James Lipton question. Your new album is called Fearless. What scares Taylor Swift? My definition of “fearless” is not that you’re not afraid. It’s that you’re afraid but you jump anyway. I have moments where I’m afraid of the music industry, I’m afraid of being average, I’m afraid of not mattering to people. I’m not afraid for this second album, honestly. There are moments when I think, “Is there anything that’s missing?” But there’s really not.\n\nYou have a new song called “Hey Stephen.” Is this guy getting the Taylor Swift smackdown? This is a guy I had a crush on. I wrote about all these reasons he should be with me instead of other girls. [laughs] “Hey Stephen/I could give you 50 reasons/Why I should be the one you choose/All those other girls are beautiful/But would they write a song for you?” This guy has absolutely no idea I had a crush on him. It’s gonna be kind of interesting when he finds out.\n\nThat could be a pretty short song. “Hey Stephen/If you haven’t heard/I’ve sold like 10 billion records/We should go out.” That’s not a good reason to date me!\n\nWhat’s up with you and that Jonas Brother? I’m not going to answer the question if you refer to him as “that Jonas Brother.” [laughs]\n\nI’m not well-versed in all things Jonas. I only know there’s three of them. [Sweetly] I’m sorry.\n\nBut your fans want to know! Which one? [laughs]\n\nCrap. Joe? Is that even one of them? He’s an amazing guy, and anybody would be lucky to be dating him.\n\nSo I got it? He’s the one? I’m not admitting anything.\n\nI’m awesome! I’m impressed. I didn’t think you had a chance.\n\nSo, promise rings — not a deal-breaker? [Long pause] I don’t ever talk about how I feel about that sort of thing because it makes people look at me sexually, which has never been a goal of mine. So, honestly, deal-breaker? That’s actually a plus for me.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Interview with Taylor Swift: She's Living Her Taylor-Made Dream\nCan a small-town Pennsylvania girl who has conquered both mean girls and dirty, cheatin' boys find happiness--and massive fame--on the music scene? Yep if her name is Taylor Swift. She's living proof that you can achieve some pretty great things by going your own way.\n\nby Rory Evans Every woman experiencing a bad breakup, romantic infidelity, or maybe even just garden-variety heartache should have access to two drum-sticks, a 30-gallon galvanized-steel trash can, and a capacity crowd of 22,000.\n\nThis is exactly how Taylor Swift processes her emotions at a concert at the Palace of Auburn Hills, just outside Detroit. She takes a several-minute break from belting out \"Should've Said No\"--her angry ode to a real-life cheatin' ex--to shimmy around in a sparkly minidress and beat the crap out of a big ol' metal drum. When she's done hammering, she struts to the front of the stage looking flush and exhilarated--pink-cheeked, wild-haired--and just for a split second, exhausted.\n\nLooking a wee bit tired can be forgiven, though, since Swift has been in seemingly perpetual motion for about three years. When other performers moan to her about an eight-week radio tour, Swift has to laugh. \"I once went on the most grueling radio tour. Living in hotel rooms, sleeping in the backs of rental cars as my mom drove to three different cities in one day,\" recalls the singer, who has mercifully upgraded to a tricked-out custom tour bus complete with a mini chandelier and drop-down treadmill. These days, the bus is carting the singer around to promote her second album, Fearless, released in November. But her country-criss-crossing game of radio-station hopscotch originated way back in the spring of 2006, when she was promoting her first single, \"Tim McGraw.\" She stayed on the road to publicize her debut album, the sleeper hit Taylor Swift, released at the end of 2006 and reissued the following year. It went triple platinum, landing two No. 1 singles on the Billboard country chart and five singles on the Billboard Top 40. Since then, she's been opening for the likes of Brad Paisley, George Strait, Rascal Flatts, and her hero, Tim McGraw, with his wife, Faith Hill.\n\nSwift knows her life is unusual for an 18-year-old, even one teetering on the brink of becoming a one-name (T-Swi?) megastar. But as she describes her high-rev schedule, she sounds not only low-key but also disarmingly practical. \"I'll take a red-eye and do an interview, then go to a meet-and-greet, then do an appearance, then get ready for a show, then do a conference call about the album,\" she rattles off. \"My brain does get fried, but I never get tired of this.\"\n\nBesides, why whine when you're living your dream? For a girl who grew up on a Christmas tree farm (seriously) in a small town just outside Reading, Pennsylvania, this is a charmed life. \"I know that a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania is about the most random place for a country singer to come from,\" she says, \"but I had an awesome childhood. We had horses and cats, and my mom stayed home with me [and her brother, Austin, 16]. Our dad would come home from work [he's a stockbroker] and then go outside to make a split-rail fence.\"\n\nAs Currier & Ives as life on the farm was, life at school was more Dickensian. \"It was basically a shunning--and that's never a good thing, you know?\" Swift says. \"A lot of girls thought I was weird. Actually, the word they liked to use was annoying. I'd sit down at their lunch table, and they'd move to a different one.\" Instead of hanging with friends on weekends, Swift entered local karaoke contests and sang at coffee houses. She poured her anguish into writing music. At age 8, Swift started tinkering on the guitar, and after learning three chords, she wrote her first song. \"It's my way of coping,\" she says. \"I write when I'm frustrated, angry, or confused. I've figured out a way to filter all of that into something good.\" As it turns out, very good.\n\nSwift showed enough promise to motivate her family to relocate to Nashville when she turned 14. Her mother, Andrea, recalls: \"It was never about 'I want to be famous.' Taylor never uttered those words. It was about moving to a place where she could write with people she could learn from.\" Her first after-school job was working on songs in Nashville; she made enough money to buy a Lexus 430 SC convertible. She still drives it, despite a few wrecks, \"because I am monogamous when it comes to my car.\" In a delicious twist, Swift's friend Abigail Anderson says, \"she got the same [model] car as the one in the movie Mean Girls\"--take that, bitchy posse back in PA. Her entire sophomore year, Swift says, \"was positively life-changing.\" Plus, she says, like she's revealing a surprise bonus in the car's option package, \"all of a sudden, I had a lot more friends.\"\n\nShe also met some of the guys who'd end up in her distinctive hell-hath-no-fury-like-an-underclassman-scorned songs. Famously, her songs name names. \"I like to encode capital letters in the printed lyrics, so they spell out phrases. I encoded the 'Should've Said No' guy's name over and over. It was only his first name, but everyone figured it out. I'd get texts from him. He was scared out of his mind I'd crucify him on a talk show. All I could think was, 'Well, you should've said no. That's what the song is about.'\"\n\n\"Her lyrics have emotional complexity,\" says music critic Frank Kogan, who has written for Spin and The Village Voice. \"And her songs are astonishingly skillful and subtle.\" Little wonder, then, that Swift's albums appeal to more than just people her age. Her songs remind us that the romantic skills we picked up in high school are, for better or worse, the ones we'll use our whole lives. \"The drama and the trauma of the relationship you have when you're 16 can mirror the one you have when you're 26,\" Swift says. \"Life repeats itself.\"\n\nAs for whether Swift herself has different versions of her life--say, pre-megastar and post-megastar models--she insists, \"I am never going to be that 'Get out of my face!' girl.\" Living in Nashville offers its own protective layer. \"Keith and Nicole live there. Tim and Faith live there. We can all go to the grocery store in our sweatpants because the paparazzi have no idea Nashville exists.\"\n\nEven if they did, it seems unlikely that Swift could turn into a crash-and-burner like Britney or Lindsay. This is a girl who finds bliss pulling into a Cracker Barrel and ordering eggs and biscuits, who professes shock when her iPhone gongs five times in an hour (\"I never get text messages. This is exciting!\"), and who during a preconcert meet-and-greet welcomes a fan with a love grip so tight it's easy to assume this visitor is a long-lost friend--and not, say, the lucky 93rd caller who won some radio phone-in.\n\nSometimes, Swift seems almost too normal--even nerdy. One of her favorite T-shirts, for example, has the periodic table of elements printed across the front. And let's face it: The noble gases aren't the controlled substances usually linked to pop starlets. So don't expect photos of her pantiless and slinking out of a limo finding their way onto the Internet anytime soon.\n\nThough, on the subject of underpants: A girl's gotta wear them. And every so often, a girl's gotta buy them. And Swift wouldn't mind being able to purchase her skivvies in peace. One day not long ago, she went shopping at Victoria's Secret: \"I look up and there are, like, 15 people looking at me, with camera phones out, waiting to take a picture of which kind of underwear I'm going to buy. Think she's a small or an extra small? I wanted to be, like, 'Uh, guys? I can hear you.'\"\n\nSwift brings the same good-natured exasperation to another ongoing topic of interest: her love life. More specifically, whether she's dating one-third of the boy band the Jonas Brothers--a question she categorically refuses to answer. At a preshow event at the Palace, a TV reporter had brought his teenage daughter to ask: \"Are you seeing Joe Jonas?\" The most Swift allows is a pleasant \"Anyone would be lucky to be dating him.\"\n\nNo matter. Somewhere down the road, her lyrics will likely give her away. And heaven help Joe Jonas or any other guy (not to mention that 30-gallon steel can) if he ever does her wrong.\n\nPop quiz\n\nFavorite Lyrics\n\"Something written by one of my favorite radio guys, who is also a songwriter: 'If there was no change, there would be no butterflies.' He once sent me a thank-you note and quoted that at the bottom, writing, 'I'm sure everyone is telling you Don't change. But I think the right thing to say is to always embrace change gracefully.' That's a beautiful line.\"\n\nFunniest Country & Western Song Title\n\"'She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy' has got to take the cake on that one!\"\n\nBest Advice From Her Dad\n\"He is the king of one-liners, so he has about 50 million pieces of advice. He'll say, \"Buy bonds!\" instead of \"bye-bye!\" Because he's a stockbroker.\n\nWeirdest Thing In Her Fridge\n\"Apple butter from Cracker Barrel. I also carry my own salad dressing. It's raspberry-walnut vinaigrette from the grocery store.\"\n\nWho She'd Like To Be Stuck In An Elevator With\n\"Ellen DeGeneres. That situation would panic a lot of people, but she'd be like, 'Hey, whatever!' and make a joke. Then we'd laugh and dance.\"\n\nHow Many Texts She Sends On An Average Day\n\"Ten. It's funny, I thought the contact list in my phone would grow if I was in the music industry. But I had more people in my phone book when I was in high school!\"\n\nBest Mom Advice\n\"Don't ever call a guy first. The thing they want the most is whatever they can't have. It sounds really juvenile, but it works.\"Published: Nov 03, 2008 10:37 AM EST\n\n",

      "Transcript/Content": "She’s writing her future\nBy Randy Lewis\nOct. 26, 2008 12 AM PT\nLEWIS IS A TIMES STAFF WRITER.\n\nTaylor Swift doesn’t bat a blue eye at rewriting history.\nTake the 18-year-old’s latest single, “Love Story.” It’s all about romance and destiny -- two subjects that often occupy her teenage brain. She even invokes the names of the world’s most celebrated star-crossed lovers in this sunny hit that’s steadily climbing the country singles chart.\n\nIt’s Romeo and Juliet with a significant difference: Nobody dies.\n\n“I was going through a situation like that where I could relate,” the energetic singer-songwriter said recently on a whirlwind visit to Los Angeles. “I used to be in high school where you see [a boyfriend] every day. Then I was in a situation where it wasn’t so easy for me, and I wrote this song because I could relate to the whole Romeo and Juliet thing. I was really inspired by that story.\n\n“Except for the ending,” she quickly added. “I feel like they had such promise and they were so crazy for each other. And if that had just gone a little bit differently, it could have been the best love story ever told. And it is one of the best love stories ever told, but it’s a tragedy. I thought, why can’t you . . . make it a happy ending and put a key change in the song and turn it into a marriage proposal?”\n\nWhether it’s Shakespeare, dating or a disintegrating music business, Swift is only too willing to reshape the rules according to her own ideas about how things ought to be. She’s demonstrated that repeatedly since she was a brazen 12-year-old who went door to door down Nashville’s famed Music Row of record company offices saying, “Hi, I’m Taylor! I write songs and I think you should sign me.”\n\nWhen most of her peers were busy with after-school sports or drama club, she would head off every day to her job at Sony/ATV Music Publishing where, at 14, she was hired to write more songs, as a professional in the country music capital.\n\nNow, after selling more than 3 million copies of her 2006 debut album, “Taylor Swift,” the tall and perky blond with the thick curly tresses is gearing up for another onslaught of activity with the impending arrival of her sophomore album, “Fearless,” due out Nov. 11. Although it’s poised to be one of the big-gun releases of the holiday season, that doesn’t intimidate Swift or her record company one iota.\n\n“I think any time you’ve had this kind of success it starts to get weighty,” said Scott Borchetta, president of Big Machine Records, who signed Swift even before his label was fully up and running. “But she’s delivered a brilliant record.\n\n“We’re all keenly aware of what’s going on in the economy,” Borchetta said. “So the conversation really centers on the reality that the new album will do whatever the market will bear.\n\n“But looking at the economy of scale, and at what a hugely successful record can do right now, it’s already hugely successful. The first single is screaming. We’ve had a half-million paid downloads for ‘Love Story,’ and ‘Fearless’ is just opening up. What that means by the time Nov. 11 rolls around, we have to kind of wait and see.”\n\nFor Swift, who also co-produced the new album, it’s all about getting her material out to listeners.\n\n“You have to hear the song we just recorded yesterday!” she tells a visitor. The song she’s talking about, “Forever and Always,” was born near the end of the recording process, and Swift pleaded with Borchetta to let her add it to the album a day before she had to turn in the final version.\n\n“It’s about watching somebody fade away in a relationship,” she said. “They said they were going to be with you forever, that they loved you, and then something changed in the relationship and you don’t know what it is, but you’re watching them slowly drift. That emotion of rejection, for me, usually starts out sad and then gets mad. This song starts with this pretty melody that’s easy to sing along with, then in the end . . . I’m bas- ically screaming it because I’m so mad. I’m really proud of that.”\n\nAlthough that might seem like a strange comment coming from a country singer, Swift said that she felt as though she achieved something authentic and raw.\n\n“When I go into the studio, it’s really more about portraying the song in a way that gets the feeling across, rather than every phrase being exactly perfect. . . . I think it’s the writer in me that’s a little more obsessed with the meaning of the song than the vocal technique. All that stuff is like math to me. Over-thinking vocals and stuff -- I never want to get to that point.”\n\n--\n\nRare traits\n\nSwift was a high school sophomore when her self-titled debut was released, and before long, she had exchanged public school for home schooling so she could keep up with the mushrooming demands on her time. She scored new artist honors from the Country Music Assn. and the Academy of Country Music and watched wide-eyed last December when her name was called among the nominees for the best new artist Grammy Award, a prize she ultimately lost to a much darker talent, Amy Winehouse.\n\nTV talk show hosts love Swift because she possesses such a rare collection of traits. With her cover girl beauty and effervescent personality, she’s great on camera, and she brings with her a suitcase full of songs that aren’t ashamed to voice the perspective of a living, breathing and sometimes heartbroken teenager.\n\n“I usually generalize it and say I like to write songs about boys, but it’s more than that,” she said over a breakfast of what she deemed “probably the best French toast I’ve had in my life,” along with a couple of scrambled eggs and a glass of fresh orange juice. “I like to write songs about relationships, and the steps that take us to a heartbreak, or the steps that take us to falling in love and all that’s in between. It’s my favorite thing to write about [because] you never run out of material and you keep coming back to it.\n\n“It’s like moths to the flame, no matter how many times you’re hurt by love, no matter how many times you’ve gotten your heart broken, you’ll always come back, no matter how long it takes,” she added. “It could be years, but you will be attracted to love again.”\n\nThat’s the thing about being a teenager: Love is always a matter of life and death, every relationship either Sleeping Beauty and Prince Charming or Tristan and Isolde. Yet even at a relatively tender age, Swift has figured out how to view her experiences -- and those of her BFF Abigail and others who share their deep, dark secrets -- with an artist’s eye.\n\n“I think as a songwriter you need to have a completely wild imagination about what could be and what might have been,” Swift said. “Some of your most heartbreaking material is what could have been, and some of your most romantic material is what could be.”\n\nHer imagination takes her to a number of different places on the new album. On “You’re Not Sorry,” she begins to see that the apologies she’s hearing from a wayward boyfriend are really those of a first-class liar. “White Horse” addresses the sobering realization that romantic fantasy doesn’t always pan out (“I’m not your princess/ This ain’t no fairy tale”) and “You Belong With Me” is the old story of someone who thinks she’s the true love of a boy who’s involved with someone else (“She doesn’t get your sense of humor like I do/ She’ll never know your story like I do”). The utterly endearing “Fifteen” rolls out a bit of advice to an incoming high school freshman.\n\nAmong the most touching new songs is “The Best Day,” a love letter to her mother, with shout-outs to her father, Scott, and younger brother, Austin. (Andrea Swift usually accompanies her daughter while she’s on tour.)\n\nAs a whole, “Fearless” represents a major advance in her confidence and acumen as a songwriter and evinces complete faith in her conversational vocal style, one that positions her as the celebrity teen that other girls would most like to hang out with and the one most boys would want to ask to the prom.\n\nThat’s still something with which Swift struggles. For most of her time in high school, she and Abigail, who is mentioned by name in “Fifteen,” thought of themselves as ugly ducklings.\n\n“We kind of came to the conclusion in ninth grade that we were never going to be popular, so we should just stick together and have fun and not take ourselves too seriously,” Swift said. “That’s why I had so much fun in high school, because I didn’t focus too much on the fact that I wasn’t really in the clique.”\n\n--\n\nSignature look\n\nNot surprisingly, Swift is a master multi-tasker. While previewing the album for a reporter, she simultaneously took part in a telephone conference with members of Def Leppard, the British hard rock band with which she recently taped an installment of CMT’s “Crossroads” series, slated to premiere Nov. 7. (“My mom literally listened to them when she was pregnant with me,” she said, “and then raised me on Def Leppard music.”)\n\nJust as one of her new songs would end, she would race in from the other room, cellphone still glued to her ear, grab her iPod, scroll to the next song she wanted to show off, punch it up, then fly back into the adjoining room, without dropping a beat of her chat with the Leppard guys.\n\nShe’s in her now signature look: a sundress and cowgirl boots, her wrists ringed with bracelets made and sent to her by various fans. Her fashion sense is translating into a line of inexpensive sundresses that’ll be sold at Wal-Mart stores. “I always thought if I ever were to do a fashion line, I wouldn’t want to do [clothes] that girls like me and girls my age couldn’t afford,” she said.\n\nIt’s one more expression of Swift’s powerful Everygirl connection with her audience, which she’s strengthened with practically a daily presence on her MySpace page.\n\n“Blogging has been really fun because I like to let people into my life as much as possible. Obviously,” she said, bursting into laughter. “I think it’s important for the people who keep you going and support you and have your back out there in the world to know that you’re thinking of them all the time.”\n\nBut that takes time and energy, especially when it’s added to everything else Swift does.\n\n“I get tired, yeah. A lot. But . . . I would so much rather be hopping from a plane to a tour bus to go on a stage to doing an interview to doing a talk show to doing this performance to doing that performance to doing an awards show,” Swift said. “So when I start to get really physically worn down, I just mentally go back to the place when I would have to get up really early for a test in high school, and I’m like, ‘Hey, this is pretty cool.’ ”\n\n--\n\nrandy.lewis@latimes.com",

      "Transcript/Content": "HOT DISH: Taylor Swift Talks About Songwriting, Friends and Good Manners\nAfter Lots of Hard Work, the Young Star Is Anxious to Release Her Second Album\nOctober 6, 2008; Written by Hazel Smith\n\n(CMT Hot Dish is a weekly feature written by veteran columnist Hazel Smith. Author of the cookbook, Hazel's Hot Dish: Cookin' With Country Stars, she also hosts CMT's Southern Fried Flicks With Hazel Smith and shares her recipes at CMT.com.)\n\n\"Hank Williams, Harlan Howard, Alan Jackson. Three names that mean greatness when it comes to writing country songs. Your name, Taylor Swift, can be in the same sentence with these songwriters.\"\n\nThe hottest 18-year-old in the biz, Taylor Swift is always sure of herself, but I think she was taken aback but for a moment when I told her that last week.\n\n\"They are awesome,\" she replied. \"It's awesome you would say that. It is such an honor to be in country music and to look to the legends and to call Nashville home. It's unreal.\"\n\nFearless is the title of Taylor's second album, set for Nov. 11 release, but it doesn't mean she is completely unafraid. Don't think for a minute that she will jump in headfirst without thinking or without fear. She thinks out situations. This smart girl would choose a career before romance.\n\nHer favorite song on the record is \"Fifteen,\" a song she wrote when she first met her best, positive and constant friend, Abigail. Those two giggly girls both fell in love for the first time with boys who had cars. Abigail got her heart broken, but Taylor realized her dreams were more important than a boyfriend or a broken heart.\n\n\"The thing about high school, you don't know anything,\" she told me. \"You don't know anything, but you think you know everything.\"\n\n(I don't know about you readers, but that last sentence from the lips of an 18-year-old just floored me. Wouldn't it be great if the tabloids wrote about that!)\n\nIt's difficult for the two friends since Abigail is off at college while and Taylor is either on her bus, on the stage or at a concert venue, but the two friends either talk on the telephone or chat by video every day to stay current.\n\n\"She shows me things in her dorm, and I'll show her the hotel I'm staying in or the places where I happen to be,\" Taylor said.\n\nHer mom? \"My mom and I are closer than ever,\" assured Taylor. \"Out in the big world, I've learned to appreciate my mom. I realize how smart she is. I know my mom knows more than I do. Our arguments become discussions. We are together on the bus or at home all the time, and it works for us.\"\n\nI'd learned that Taylor handwrites notes to radio programmers to thank them for interviews or for adding her record. This is almost unheard of in this day and time, so I asked Taylor about the practice.\n\n\"Well,\" she slowly and shyly answered, \"I think taking the time to write a letter or a card is more personal than an e-mail. E-mail is great but ... I'd rather write something to someone so they can hold it in their hands. Besides, I owe something to radio. At 16, radio took a chance on me when I wrote 'Tim McGraw,' so I owe them.\"\n\nShe opened the songwriting door with the last statement, so I asked her about how she wrote songs -- if the lyrics came before the melody or if they came together.\n\n\"Lyrics and melody are married,\" she replied. \"Hand in hand, synchronic, I write it all together. Sometimes after I've written a song and I'm thinking about it, a line will hit me that will suit better than the original, so I'll change it, or I'll come up with a line I want to repeat in the bridge. Song ideas never hit me at the same place or the same time of day. I might awake at 2 a.m. in my bunk on the bus with a song idea, and I wipe my sleepy eyes and write.\"\n\nSleep can be a precious commodity for touring acts.\n\n\"I've had trouble sleeping lately, thinking about writing this album,\" she said. \"Obsessed with the album, not just the music but the photos. Picking which photo matches what song in the album booklet.\"\n\nDid Taylor watch the Grey's Anatomy episode the night they played her song, \"White Horse\"?\n\n\"Yes!\" she shrieked. \"I was onstage with Rascal Flatts in Tulsa. My mom videoed me as I bolted offstage and rushed to watch the TV show. I was dancing around. Mom was videoing me. It was wild. I put it up on MySpace.\"\n\n\"You are the MySpace girl,\" I interjected.\n\n\"I've been doing MySpace since I was in the eighth grade,\" she added.\n\n\"You're the original MySpace country star,\" I assured her.\n\n\"That's what they say,\" she giggled. \"I have almost a million MySpace friends.\"\n\nSaying that's all the time we had, Big Machine Records' John Zarling interrupted Taylor before I had a chance to ask about boyfriends, but she did tell me what an incredible friend Kellie Pickler is.\n\n\"There's much more to Kellie than lip gloss and a smile,\" said Taylor.\n",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift shot to stardom by mining her real-life heartbreaks for poppy country hits, and she’s not messing with the formula on her second album. “I just wrote songs about what I like to write about, which is boys,” she says. Working again with producer Nathan Chapman, Swift spent nearly eight months in Nashville studios recording 50-plus new songs, from which she picked Fearless‘ 13 tracks. The banjo-plucked first single, “Love Story,” is a modern Romeo and Juliet tale, and the uptempo “You Belong With Me” is about watching her best friend date a snobby popular girl (“It’s a terrible movie that I lived a lot in high school,” she says). Colbie Caillat sings on “Breathe,” and Martina McBride’s kids lend finger snaps to “Hey Steven,” an upright-bass-propelled groove inspired by a quickie crush. The one track that isn’t about the 18-year-old’s love life is “Change,” a spunky pop song inspired by her career: It begins with a frustrated star-to-be struggling to get her music out on a small label and ends with gorgeous, triumphant “hallelujah” choruses. “I finished the song after I won the CMA Horizon Award,” Swift says. “I’m happy the song got to end the way it ended.”\n\nThis is a story from the October 2, 2008 issue of Rolling Stone.",

      "Transcript/Content": "My Music, Myspace, My Life\n\nBY now Taylor Swift knows how to work all the different digital cameras, all the different camera phones. When surrounded by a group of fans clamoring for pictures, as she was here on a Saturday night in mid-October after a sold-out show at the McKenzie Arena, she warmly appropriated the camera of each one, struck a cute pose, snapped the picture and then handed it back, usually followed by a hug. All in all it was a fair trade: intimacy for control.\n\n“Intimidation isn’t what I’m going for,” Ms. Swift, 18, said earlier in the day in the Zen-like tour bus she and her mother, Andrea, designed, from the leather on the sofas to the faux peacock feathers on the bathroom wall. “I don’t have big security guards,” she said as Fox News played mutely on the television. “I don’t have an entourage. I try to write lyrics about what’s happening to me and leave out the part that I live in hotel rooms and tour buses. It’s the relatability factor. If you’re trying too hard to be the girl next door, you’re not going to be.”\n\nThus far Ms. Swift, who spends much of her free time updating her MySpace page and editing personal videos to upload to the Internet, has not had a tough time finding the right balance. She has quickly established herself as the most remarkable country music breakthrough artist of the decade. In part that’s because she is one of Nashville’s most exciting songwriters, with a chirpy, exuberant voice. But mainly Ms. Swift’s career has been noteworthy for what happens once the songs are finished. She has aggressively used online social networks to stay connected with her young audience in a way that, while typical for rock and hip-hop artists, is proving to be revolutionary in country music. As she vigilantly narrates her own story and erases barriers between her and her fans, she is helping country reach a new audience.\n\nMs. Swift’s second album, “Fearless” (Big Machine), will be released Tuesday, and like her self-titled 2006 debut, it’s full of charming, clean-scrubbed songs about teenage love and heartbreak. Ms. Swift writes from her own experiences, names intact, giving her songs an almost radical intimacy, especially in a pop world of plasticized come-ons and impersonal brush-offs.\n\nShe has placed the concerns of young women at the center of her songs, subject matter that generally has been anathema in the more mature world of country singers. Most important, though, she very much sees country music as part of the larger pop panorama. A huge success on country radio, she has also found homes on pop stations and at MTV, including a gig hosting the MTV Video Music Awards preshow in September, an unheard-of slot for a country singer. This week an entire episode of “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” will be devoted to her album release party. Put more plainly, she has proved that there’s no reason a country singer can’t be a pop star too.\n\nJust four years ago, when Ms. Swift and her family moved from Wyomissing, Pa., to Hendersonville, a Nashville suburb, this seemed an impossible proposition. It had been more than a decade since a teenager last made a true impact in town, but that singer, LeAnn Rimes, had been praised for sounding grown-up; Ms. Swift’s music was unabashedly youthful. When Scott Borchetta, president of Big Machine Records, would talk to Nashville insiders about his teenage signee, “people would look at me cross-eyed,” he said. “I would feel like they were deleting me from their Blackberrys as I was telling them.”\n\nBut Ms. Swift had been carefully honing her sound for a few years already. After a trip to Nashville when she was 11, she began writing songs and learning to play guitar in earnest. (She now often plays a Swarovski crystal-encrusted one.) By the time her family moved, in the summer before her freshman year of high school, she had already been singing at coffee shops and minor league baseball games.\n\nMs. Swift first signed a publishing deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the youngest person the company had ever signed. Every day after school she would truck off to one of Nashville’s many studios on Music Row for writing appointments.\n\n“I knew every writer I wrote with was pretty much going to think, ‘I’m going to write a song for a 14-year-old today,’ ” Ms. Swift said. “So I would come into each meeting with 5 to 10 ideas that were solid. I wanted them to look at me as a person they were writing with, not a little kid.”\n\nIt was during this time that Ms. Swift honed her songwriting strength: looking in the mirror. Relationships and their failures, the fodder for so much teenage pop, are her primary texts. “I have an obsession with knowing the answers to things,” she said. “When I don’t know what happened, it just bothers me, gets under my skin, and I need to write about it. For years.”\n\nHer mother, Andrea, said: “She simply has to write songs. It’s how she filters life.” (Andrea, who was previously a stay-at-home mom, now travels with her daughter; Ms. Swift’s father, Scott, is a stockbroker.)\n\nAnd so, around the play-by-play details of broken hearts and romantic dreams, Ms. Swift’s sound began to coalesce. She has an ear for the indelible chorus — “She’s one of those writers who won’t run away from a hook,” Mr. Borchetta said — but her music is appropriately loose. There are obvious country flourishes in the arrangements, but mainly her vocals, excitable and airy and hardly twangy at all, take center stage.\n\nWhether anyone would accept Ms. Swift’s sound was an open question. “We felt it wasn’t likely that country radio would embrace it unless we had a story,” Mr. Borchetta said, so Ms. Swift made a series of biographical shorts to air on the GAC (Great American Country) cable network. Then came “Tim McGraw,” Ms. Swift’s canny first single, named after the country superstar. (In the lyrics Mr. McGraw is the singer of a special song she and a boy share.) “We put that out deliberately, so people would ask, who’s this new artist with a song called ‘Tim McGraw’?” said Mr. Borchetta, who likened its reception to that of “a grenade in a still pond.”\n\nReleased in late 2006, Ms. Swift’s debut album sold a modest 39,000 copies in its first week, but as Ms. Swift gained attention and released more singles, it did not stop selling. It has now moved well over three million copies. Last year Ms. Swift won the Country Music Association’s Horizon Award for best new artist, and this year she is nominated for female vocalist of the year. She will also perform at the ceremony, which is Wednesday.\n\n“From the moment ‘Tim McGraw’ hit the channel, she began to amass an audience that traditional Nashville didn’t know or didn’t believe existed, and that is young women, specifically teens,” said Brian Philips, executive vice president and general manager of CMT (Country Music Television). “It’s as if Taylor has kind of willed herself into being.”\n\nShe has willed herself beyond the country music world too. After landing at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart, “Teardrops on My Guitar,” the third single on her first album, became a crossover hit, peaking at No. 13 on the Hot 100. “In a lot of cities the pop stations will take a chance because there’s been exposure in that market on the country station,” said Sharon Dastur, program director of the New York Top 40 station Z100 (WHTZ-FM), which played the song in a medium-level rotation last year after it had been broken at Top 40 stations in more country-friendly markets like Greensville, S.C.; Wichita, Kan.; and Austin, Tex.\n\nMs. Swift is not without forebears. In the past 15 years female country stars like Faith Hill, Shania Twain, Lee Ann Womack and the Dixie Chicks have all experienced some degree of pop success. And Ms. Swift’s ability to straddle both country and pop was facilitated by the recent crossover success of Carrie Underwood, the “American Idol” winner.\n\nMonte Lipman, president and chief executive of Universal Republic Records, which joined with Big Machine to work Ms. Swift’s records to pop radio, said: “We don’t want to alienate country radio at all because we’ve found pop success. Scott is always superserving the country marketplace first, and we work for him.”\n\nMr. Borchetta said that country radio would always be the top priority. “They’re always going to get the singles first, always going to be first in line at the meet-and-greets,” he said. “We overthink everything. One thing we can’t do is chase the moving target of pop radio. It could be all emo next year, all urban next year.”\n\nNo one much complains when a rapper or indie rocker crosses over to the pop charts, but a country singer perceived as trying to go pop can still raise eyebrows. Nashville remains a fiercely hermetic town and is unusually protective, or possessive, of its own.\n\n“I’m not about to snub the people who brought me to the party,” said Ms. Swift, who when she speaks of her plan to manage her crossover fame sounds like a well-seasoned executive. “We went back and studied other cases where it had failed every way that it can fail, and we tried to avoid those things.”\n\nMs. Swift is, by all accounts, an extremely good-natured micromanager. “She’s a very competitive person, and she’s always got her game face on,” said the country singer Kellie Pickler, one of Ms. Swift’s closest friends. “And she’s a really smart businesswoman, smarter than a lot of 40-year-olds I know.”\n\nRight before the show in Chattanooga, as she does before every performance, Ms. Swift loaded up her wrists with bracelets that she would later toss out to fans, allowing them to take home a small piece of her. And after she finished singing “Should’ve Said No,” about a boy who cheated on her, she dropped to her knees and bent forward, holding her head still as fans in the front rows patted it concernedly. It was a scarily intimate moment but essential to her self-presentation that there is no barrier between her and her songs, and their listeners, the consumers. That insistence informs every aspect of her work.\n\nIt has also led to the decimation of her privacy. “Every single one of the guys that I’ve written songs about has been tracked down on MySpace by my fans,” she said, a little giddy. “I had the opportunity to be more general on this record, but I chose not to. I like to have the last word.”\n\nThat may become less tenable, though, as Ms. Swift’s personal life makes its way into the tabloids, as it lately has in regards to her never-confirmed romance with Joe Jonas, the would-be rake of the Jonas Brothers. On this subject, at least, Ms. Swift is uncharacteristically mum: “He’s not in my life anymore, and I have absolutely nothing to say about or to him.”\n\nAt least until the next album, maybe, which Ms. Swift insists will detail her life just as thoroughly as the first two. “When I knew something was going on in someone’s personal life and they didn’t address it in their music, I was always very confused by that,” Ms. Swift said. “I owe it to people from letting them in from Day 1.”\n\nBut eventually, if things continue as they are, walls will have to be erected. Jakks Pacific has just released a line of Taylor Swift dolls, making her even more of an abstract idol and less of a real person. She is also the face of the l.e.i. clothing brand, carried exclusively at Wal-Mart, one of what is certain to be many endorsements to come. And next year she will be spending time in England, Japan and Australia in hopes of facilitating Taylor Swift, the global brand, a move that few country acts have been able to pull off.\n\nThat she’s likely to become only less accessible is a problem that Ms. Swift is, naturally, very attuned to. “All I can do,” she said, “is put up a MySpace video where I don’t have any makeup on and am wearing a periodic table of the elements T-shirt.”\n\nThat and continue to make connections, one person at a time. The night before Chattanooga, Ms. Swift was at Sommet Center in Nashville, opening a charity gig for Rascal Flatts. After emptying her wrist during “Tim McGraw,” she took in the sold-out crowd. “I am so proud to live in Nashville, Tennessee,” she said, “and I hope to run into you at the grocery store.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Leading up to the release of her second album, Fearless, the Smoking Section had the pleasure of interviewing country upstart Taylor Swift.\n\nWe all know that Swift, 18, is a preternaturally gifted songwriter (and a heartbreaker), but we were honestly shocked by how thoughtful and articulate she is for a young ‘un.\n\nThe Q+A we did ran recently in Rolling Stone, but for all of you die-hards out there, all you card-carrying members of the Taylor Nation — click more to read our full transcript. (It’s only about 6,000 words long.)\n\nEnjoy.\n\nWhat’s up, Taylor?\n\nI am in Nashville and I just left a meeting with a guy who does a lot of video editing for the promotional stuff that we do, like for my MySpace. I have to edit all the videos and sometimes I just go over and learn new tricks and go over footage. We’re also collecting a bunch of stuff for an E! Hollywood Story thing that they’re doing. Lots of video footage stuff going on right now.\n\nEverywhere you turn there must be a video camera in your face?\n\nIt seems like it, and if it’s not somebody putting a video camera in my face, it’s me putting a video camera in other people’s faces. I’m working on a video blog right now. I was at CMT’s Alan Jackson Giants taping last night, and I got every single artist who was there to say that my album comes out November 11th. I’m going to put them all together and put it on my MySpace and it’s going to be fun.  I have Hank Williams Jr., Brad Paisley, George Jones, George Strait, Miranda Lambert, Martina McBride, Dierks Bently. All the artists I love were there, and I got them all to say, “Taylor’s album comes out November 11th—go get it.”  I was so paparazzi, it’s not even funny.\n\n \n\nCool. Do you have any superstitions about 11/11?\n\nNo, it’s just the same number twice, so I figure it’ll be easier to remember than other numbers. It’s just kind of repetitive.\n\n \n\nLet’s talk about music. Let’s start from the beginning. I know your mother was listening to a lot of Def Leppard when you were in the womb.\n\n \n\nMy mom was obsessed with Def Leppard. I ended up liking country music, and I think we’re just a random family when it comes to musical tastes.\n\n \n\nAnd your grandmother was an opera singer?\n\nShe was actually a recording star in Puerto Rico when my mom was growing up. My mom was always stuck sitting backstage somewhere or sitting in a front row, watching a performance her entire childhood.  She thought that when her mom stopped performing she was relieved of those duties, but all I wanted to do was sing, ever since I was born, so she’s always been backstage.\n\n \n\nHow did your grandma become a star in Puerto Rico?\n\nMy grandparents were American, but my grandfather took a job building oil rigs over in Vietnam, so they were overseas all the time. Wherever my grandfather would go for his engineering job, my grandmother would go and perform and sing opera. She was in all these musicals in Singapore and all these gorgeous places where my mom grew up. My mom has these amazing stories of growing up overseas, and then she moved to America when she was about 10.\n\n \n\nShe moved to Pennsylvania?\n\nShe moved to Texas.  My mom grew up in Texas and my dad was a Pennsylvania boy. \n\n \n\nSo what kind of opera was your grandmother performing?\n\nShe was in the Bartered Bride, The Barber of Seville and musicals like West Side Story.  I have these gorgeous, glamorous pictures of her all in black and white. She was just so beautiful.\n\n \n\nLet’s talk about Def Leppard a little bit. Obviously it was the thrill of a lifetime for you to perform with those guys, but I’m wondering if you could tell me what it was like for your mom to meet them?\n\nShe was so star-struck, and so was my entire band and I, because before we go onstage we all listen to Def Leppard music and jump around and get ready. There was this moment where Rick Allen was testing his drum kit and they set up their instruments and everything first, and we were all sitting around watching, my band, my mom and I. You know the signature drum hit for “Pour Some Sugar On Me” the first time you hear it.\n\nIt’s absolutely unmistakable. The first time he hit it, my band and I just erupted and were just looking at each other like, “This is not happening, you’ve got to be kidding me.” \n\n \n\nLet’s embarrass your mom—what was your mom doing?\n\nMy mom was turning red, and had my camera the whole time and filmed everything.  I was like, “Mom, please don’t miss any of this.” So she had the digital camera in Joe Elliot’s face the entire time, and I had the camera in their faces, and I was like walking around interviewing them. A lot of the time, if I’m at an event with other celebrities, I want to get it on film. I’m like the biggest super-fan there, so I’ll be interviewing people and I’m doing videos with them and then I put them up on my MySpace.\n\n \n\nYou should get a job with Rolling Stone interviewing people, come on.\n\nI would love to. I’m all about more video editing than anything else. I love how if you put music behind a moving image it pops and it comes to life. That’s my favorite thing about that.\n\n \n\nBeing around Joe Elliot and realizing that these people sold over 60 million records in their careers, I thought that they would be divas. I thought that they would be snobby. I thought that they would only want to sing certain things and would only let me sing certain things.  When I walked in, I very timidly and politely asked Joe Elliot if I could sing one of the lines in “Hysteria.” He goes, “Honey I’ve been singing that for 25 years—you sing whatever you want.” I was able to sing all my favorite songs, and I could not believe it when Joe Elliot was singing “Picture To Burn.”\n\n \n\nYeah, that’s awesome. I wanted to talk to you about singing the National Anthem at the World Series. How many times have you done the National Anthem in your lifetime?\n\nI would say I’ve sung the National Anthem hundreds of times. When I was 11 years old, it occurred to me that the National Anthem was the best way to get in front of a large group of people if you don’t have a record deal.  So, I started singing the National Anthem anywhere I possibly could—76ers’ games, the US Open, and I would just send my tapes out everywhere. I would sing the National Anthem at garden club meetings. I didn’t care. I figured out that if you could sing that one song, you could get in front of 20,000 people without even having a record deal.  So I’ve sung that song many, many, many, many times and it still gives me chills, you know, when I get to sing it at an event like the World Series. Whoever thought that that was going to happen?\n\n \n\nAnd the Phillies ended up winning.\n\nAnd the Phillies won!  Oh my God. I was watching and my dad and I were sitting there crying, especially during the last throw of the game and the catcher caught the ball and .2 seconds later he’s running to the pitcher and just tackles him. It was just the sweetest thing and just watching all the instant replays of all the people’s reactions. I love it when people are so excited about success. I love it when people freak out when they win something, and it’s crazy because I actually used to sing the National Anthem for the Reading Phillies, which is their minor league team, and a lot of the members of the Philadelphia Phillies now were on that minor league team when I sang that anthem years and years and years ago.\n\n \n\nLike who, for instance?\n\nPat Burrell. There were two or three others, I was told, that were on the same team.  So that was kind of an interesting coincidence.\n\n \n\nIs the National Anthem hard to sing?\n\nFor me, the National Anthem is not as challenging range-wise, because I’ve been doing it for so long. The challenge for me is the utter silence that comes over 40,000 people in a baseball stadium and you’re the only one singing it. Even though I’ve sung it hundreds of times, it still gets you a little bit that you’re the only one singing and all those people are just focused on the song that you’re singing. It’s a really surreal moment for me. I love to play guitar with it, because I think sometimes the National Anthem can become a singing competition. I think that the National Anthem, in my opinion, is better just as a song. I think playing guitar with it just sort of puts the music back into it. \n\nIs there a certain line in the song that’s harder to hit than the other ones, where you buckle up?\n\nNo. It’s the utter silence, the silent beginning in the “Oh, say, can you see by the dawn’s early light,”–that’s when everybody’s watching, and when I get to the high notes at the end, “In the rockets’ red glare,” I know I’m fine. From that point out it’s free sailing, but it’s all about not letting my nerves kick in.\n\n \n\nYou were on a karaoke circuit growing up—what does that mean?\n\nI wanted to sing in front of people, and I didn’t have a band, and I was 11 or 10, so the first thing that I started doing was musicals. I was in a children’s company and I got all the leads because I was tall and I could play adults. That was my first taste of performing in front of people.\n\n \n\nYou did Grease…what other stuff did you do?\n\nYeah, I played Sandy in Grease; I played Kim in Bye, Bye Birdie; I played Maria in The Sound of Music, and I was 12.  What I started realizing was that, even more than the musicals, I looked forward to the cast parties afterward because there was a karaoke machine set up at every party. That’s when I got to sing country music. I got to sing Dixie Chicks songs and Shania Twain songs and Faith Hill songs and one day, somebody turned to my mom and said, “You know, she really ought to be singing country music.” It kind of occurred to all of us at the same time that that’s what I needed to be doing.\n\n \n\nI would go though the phone book and look for places where I could sing karaoke. There was this broken-down roadhouse where you could go and sing karaoke competitions, and the owner of the roadhouse also owned the amphitheater across the street. He had all these traditional country acts come to the amphitheater, like George Jones and Loretta Lynn and Charlie Daniels. If you won the karaoke contest, you got to open up for them. You got to play at like 10am when George Jones would go on at like 8pm. I would go there every single week until I won, and I got the chance to open up for Charlie Daniels. That was something that was just really exciting to me when I was like 11.\n\n \n\nWhat was the roadhouse called?\n\nPat Garrett.\n\n \n\nPat Garrett.\n\nOh yeah. Strausstown, Pennsylvania. \n\n \n\nCool, so talk about finding country music.\n\nLeAnn Rimes was my first impression of country music. I got her first album when I was six. I just really loved how she could be making music and having a career at such a young age.\n\n \n\nI think the thing that cemented it in my mind and made me fall in love with country music was seeing three great examples of what females could bring to country music—I saw that Shania Twain brought this independence and this crossover appeal; I saw that Faith Hill brought this classic old-school glamour and beauty and grace; and I saw that the Dixie Chicks brought this complete “we don’t care what you think” quirkiness, and I loved what all of those women were able to do and what they were able to bring to country music.\n\n \n\nI thought, “You know, if Nashville is the town that lets you be yourself and do things like that, and be different, then that’s where I need to be.” And country music absolutely became everything to me. I started obsessing over George Strait records and Kenny Chesney, and going back and looking through Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton. It was such a big deal to me that those three women stood for things in country music.\n\nThroughout most of your career you’ve been an opening act. It seems like now is the turning point where you’re about to take over.\n\n \n\nOh wow, thank you. I’m very fascinated with the music industry, the touring industry and the business end of things, so I’ve paid attention to other careers, the timing and decisions that were made in other careers. I’ve seen it happen where you have a successful first record, and they throw you out as a headliner way too early and it doesn’t work. You never want to have to go backwards. I don’t have an ego issue. I’m cool being an opening act. I’d rather be an opening act longer than I should, than headline too early. So, now we’re headlining. I’m starting to headline this summer and I’m really excited about that because I feel like I waited so long, that I want it so bad, and I can’t wait. I’m going to throw everything I have into this headlining tour. I feel like we’re in a place where I can really put together a great tour.\n\nWhat are you most excited about offering your fans in this capacity, where you’re the headliner, and it’s your stage?\n\n \n\nI’ve been on tour with every single one of my heroes and I’ve seen what they do live. Some things have blown me away, and I’ve taken away some things that I really want to incorporate. But there are some things that I haven’t seen done, and I want to do them. For my concerts, I really don’t want people to be seeing the same thing for more than two songs in a row. For my headlining shows, when I actually am allowed to have my own stage and my own production, I’ve already drawn up the stage plan and what I want it to look like. It’s going to look nothing like the headlining tours that I’ve supported in the past two years. I feel like there’s drama that I’ve always been attracted to–sort of a theatrical type, dramatic performance that I feel is sometimes missing when you see shows these days. I never want people to think that they’re just seeing a show where I’m playing song, after song, after song. When I play a song, I want people to feel like they’re experiencing exactly what I went through when I wrote the song as I’m singing it for them. There are set ups that I really want to create. There are visuals that I’m really excited about, and I can’t wait for you to come out and see a show.\n\n \n\nIs it going to be like the “Romeo and Juliet” bit and stuff like that?\n\n \n\nI really want some costume changes. I’m going to create a bunch of video content specifically for the concert. I would love, when I’m singing “Love Story,” to be dressed up in the video outfit, make people feel like they’re experiencing something really unique. If they want to hear the record, they’ll listen to it. You know? They’ll put in the CD or they’ll listen to their iPod. But if they want to come out to a concert, I feel like it should be something completely different.\n\n \n\nDo you ever write songs that aren’t about boys?\n\n \n\nYes. I do. I have a few on this record that are about other things. I have a song called “15” that reminisces about my freshman year and a song called “Change” that was actually featured on the Olympics. And there’s a song called “The Best Day” that I wrote about my mom and my childhood. It was really cool to go back to that place and reflect. I wrote some of the lyrics in the song, sort of in a child-like kind of language, which was really fun for me as a writer to stretch that way. But I really like writing songs about boys. I like writing songs about relationships. And when someone breaks up with me, I like to write about it, because I feel like I have the last word.\n\n \n\nYou don’t have any problem naming names in your songs, do you?\n\n \n\nI have no issue with naming names. I think that it’s sort of fun for me to know that when the album comes out, there are going to be people who are going hear about it. My personal goal for my songs is to be so detailed that the guy the song is written about knows. It’s so detailed, it’s so personal, that he knows it’s written about him. I think it’s just a fun thing for me. I don’t know why I like it so much. It’s kind of exciting to put a song on the album that you know is going to personally affect you when it comes out.\n\n \n\nOr affect somebody else? \n\n \n\nMostly that it will affect somebody else. That’s the fun part.\n\nWhat are your favorite country songs that – not necessarily where you’re dissing somebody, but just those great country lines like, “Take your tongue out of my mouth cause I’m kissing your ass goodbye.”\n\n \n\nLoretta Lynn, “Fist City” – have you heard that?\n\n \n\nSure…\n\n \n\nShe says, “I’ll grab you by the hair on your head, and I’ll lift you off the ground. I’m not saying my baby’s a saint, cause he ain’t.” Isn’t that a cool line?\n\n \n\nYup.\n\n \n\n“But he won’t cat around with a kitty.” That’s so amazing.\n\nObviously you have a song called “Change,” and we’ve been hearing a lot about that, a lot about change in the Presidential election, and I’m wondering if you’re a Pennsylvania Democrat or a Pennsylvania Republican.\n\nYou know, I just try and stick to my specialty and my specialty is music, and writing songs. I voted yesterday, but I don’t think it’s my job to try and influence people which way they should vote, because it’s a very personal thing. All the way through the line–I waited an hour and a half to vote–I was wavering back and forth who’s ideas I liked better, and who really represented what I believed in. I kept going back over articles I’d read, and trying to figure out who to vote for. When I got in the voting booth, I just said to myself, “All of my best decisions have been based on my gut instinct. Who’s the President of the United States?” And, I pushed a name and I voted.\n\n \n\nReally?\n\n \n\nHonestly, I think it’s good to be well versed on the election and who believes in what. Sometimes I think you can over saturate yourself with facts, and in a lot of cases, it sounds cliché, but you should really just do what you feel.\n\nYour record is called Fearless. And you’ve definitely shown, in your musical career, a fearless attitude. But what are you scared of?\n\nWell thank you for saying that. I think what I’m scared of, honestly, is anything happening to my family, or anything happening to my fans. The hardest that I’ve cried in my life is when I’ve been told that I’ve had fans that have had something tragic happen to them, and lost fans. That’s a really, really big fear of mine. I’ve sat there in the bus with the family of an eighteen year old who got in a car wreck and died his senior year, who had my CD cover taped to the dash of his car. That kind of loss – that’s what scares me. I’ve had an amazing run at this. If it were to go away, I would hate it, but I cant say that that’s my biggest fear.\n\nWhat artists do you know nothing about – that you might be embarrassed to know nothing about? I mean, you must have older guys in your band who say, “Oh, you don’t know this song, you don’t know that song?” Like The Rolling Stones or Bob Dylan or something?\n\n \n\nI’m pretty well versed on that, but, the stuff that my band is obsessed with, like the hair metal, I’ve just always been so focused on Def Leppard that I never explored too much more of the hair metal bands. I wish I knew a little more about them. Just so that I could keep up, you know, in the conversation about the hair metal bands. That seems to be the topic of choice for my band.\n\nI’m just wondering if you’ve found something recently that you’ve really fallen in love with, maybe outside of the country realm.\n\n \n\nThere’s a song that I really love, and I haven’t heard the whole record. But, there’s a song called “After Tonight” by Justin Nozuka and the song is completely acoustic until the chorus. It’s got a really cool rootsy sound to it. You should listen to it. It’s really great.- like Jack Johnson with a different twist. I really like that.\n\n \n\nAre you a Jack Johnson fan?\n\nI’m a huge Jack Johnson fan. My ringtone is “Taylor” by Jack Johnson. I just ignore the fact that the song is about a – it’s about a prostitute or is it a stripper? But I will take ownership because it has my name in it. And you know what, also – I think, and this is a really poppy choice, but I think it’s really cool that Jesse McCartney is R&B now. I think it’s a really cool direction for him.  I just recently listened to the whole record, and I was like, “You know what? I didn’t really understand it at first, but now I get it.” I love the new single, and I think that’s a really good place for him to be. I think it’s really good for his voice. He did a T-Pain cover recently and killed it live, so I have a newfound respect for him and his vocal abilities, and the way his career has gone. Also, I’m really into Katy Perry. The whole record is great. There’s a song called “Thinking of You” that I’m really, really obsessed with. I’m also obsessed with Sinead O’Connor’s “Nothing Compares 2 U.” I have that song on repeat right now. And I love it.\n\n \n\nThat’s something that you just discovered or…\n\n \n\nIt’s something that stuck with me. I discovered it last year, and I feel like there’s a timeless thing that that song has. It’s just really awesome. It’s just one of those songs where you know that when it was written, like 5,000 songwriters just put their pen down and went, “Alright. I tried.” The way that it is and the way that it’s sung, I think it’s a brilliant song.\n\n \n\nDoes your guitar have a name? Did you name your guitar?\n\n \n\nI know that the techs have named them different things and there’s one that’s completely covered in crystals, so they call that “Sparks” or “Sparkles.” I have a Koa guitar. It’s either the Koa or the sparkly guitar that I use or the black electric, so usually we’ll just say, Koa, Sparkles or Black Electric. \n\nHow many songs have you written?\n\n \n\nIt’s got to be about 500. I absolutely can’t stop writing songs. It’s funny because sometimes you’ll hear artists talking about how they have to hurry up and write this next record and it’s like, I can’t stop writing. I can’t turn it off. I go through situations and I go through experiences and I go through life and I need to write it. I need to write it down. It’s like breathing. It’s kind of interesting because whenever I’ve gone in to record albums, I mean, we’re going through like a hundred songs and trying to pick the best one.\n\n \n\nThat’s a good problem to have.\n\nI’m really grateful that I haven’t had any major writing blocks or anything like that. I just like to write my life. I just did an Alan Jackson painting last night and I realized something about him that I’ve always loved–you know who he is and you know who he stands for and you know what he believes in because his main goal is that he’s always written about his life, and he hasn’t really strived for the vocal acrobatics. He hasn’t tried to be anything but a guy who sings about his life. I realized last night, that’s my goal. That’s all I want to do.\n\n \n\nI know that you have covered Eminem and I’m wondering if you notice a connection between country and hip-hop, lyrically.\n\nI feel like country and hip-hop are two of the most honest genres because we just like to sing about our lifestyle. We like to sing about the things that go on in our daily activities and we’re proud of the way we live and we’re proud of the things that we stand for. I feel like that pride is something that both country and hip-hop share. I’ve always been fascinated by hip-hop. I’ve always just really taken a keen interest in the rhyming of it all. Poetry was the first thing that ever fascinated me about words and about writing. Poetry is what turned me into a songwriter. I found out that if you get the right amount of words and the right syncopation and you get the right rhymes at the end, you can make words bounce off of a page. So hip-hop has always been something that I looked at and thought, “Wow, that really is an incredible art form.” I think Eminem does it unbelievably well.\n\n \n\nYou read a lot of poetry growing up?\n\nI would read the Shel Silverstein poems, Dr. Seuss, and I noticed early on that poetry was something that just stuck in my head and I was replaying those rhymes and try to think of my own. In English, the only thing I wanted to do was poetry and all the other kids were like, “Oh, man. We have to write poems again?” and I would have a three-page long poem. I won a national poetry contest when I was in fourth grade for a poem called “Monster In My Closet.”\n\n \n\nWow.\n\nYeah, that’s big time.\n\n \n\nYou’ve been winning awards your whole life! That’s crazy. What award do you want to win the most?\n\nI want an American Music Award really bad. Really bad! They’re so shiny!\n\n \n\nMore than a Grammy or a Moonman?\n\nI mean, a Grammy would be wonderful. That would certainly make me cry upon my name being announced, but the American Music Awards are very shiny and they are fan-voted and that’s where I base most of my pride in awards. My award shelf has got a lot of CMT Music Awards on it. Those are the ones that I’m most fond of because the fans went online and voted. I love industry awards. I love my ACM. I give my TMA award a hug every now and then. That’s all well and good, but I think the fan-voted awards have always been my favorite.\n\n \n\nTell me about the first song you wrote. I believe it was called “Lucky You.”\n\nOh yeah, and there are some great versions of that online. You can hear my chipmunk 12-year-old voice singing that song. I’m pretty sure it got leaked on the internet because some fans were telling me that they heard it and I was like, “Oh no!” But that’s a song that I wrote…it was one of the first finished songs. It was made of three chords because those are the only chords I knew at the time.\n\n \n\nIt’s a G an A and a D, or something like that?\n\nIt’s a G and a D and a C, then back to D. The song was about a girl who didn’t fit in and she didn’t care and she was different than everyone else. I think there’s a long chorus of me singing “Do do do do do do do do do do”. It’s very young and I look back and it’s kind of interesting to hear those kind of storylines and the lyrics that I used to write compared to the lyrics that I write now.\n\n \n\nSo you’ve come a long way?\n\n \n\nI would hope.\n\n \n\nDo you think in songwriting and just about anything else in life that practice makes perfect?\n\nI think sometimes practice makes perfect. But I think sometimes you look back on the things that you wrote when you were 12 and you were like, “Wow, I couldn’t have thought of that now.” I think that it’s all case-by-case. I’m more proud of the music on this record than I am with the music on the first record, but you never know if that’s just me being a songwriter who likes the last thing that I wrote the best. In retrospect, I’ve been going over all these videos for some of the BIO specials that have been asking for video content and I’ve been looking over the videos of stuff that I wrote when I was 12 and there are songs that I’ve found myself relating to. It’s kind of interesting to hear the lyrics I was writing back then. I think that I’m definitely really proud of the stuff that I’ve been writing lately.\n\n \n\nWhat’s the most bizarre, craziest thing you’ve seen looking out into a crowd?\n\nThere’s always the frat boy who has got my name painted on his chest, which is always awesome. One of my favorite moments of the night is when I’m in the middle of my acoustic set and I’m in a really poignant moment and I’m trying to be serious and you hear the group of guys with southern accents going, “Marry me!” It’s really good to have that in my life because it just makes me happy. I find that there are people out in the crowd of all ages. I’ve got a group of seven-year-olds that their moms all took them to the show, there’s a group of six 40-year-olds all wearing tiaras and holding receptors and singing “Love Story.” I really don’t have just one age group.\n\n \n\nSo the guys don’t knock you off your game when they’re screaming at you from the crowd?\n\nNo. Dolly Parton had the best response to that kind of thing. Some guy screamed from the crowd “I love you, Dolly!” and she goes, “I thought I told you to stay in the truck!” I’m going to start saying that.\n\n \n\nHave you ever met a guy while on stage? Like a boyfriend?\n\nOne time, like a year and a half ago, I was doing a show at a college and I was signing autographs afterwards and there was a guy that I saw from across this field and I noticed that he looked just like Denny from Grey’s Anatomy. I was so obsessed with Denny from Grey’s Anatomy and he died and he was my favorite and I have this weird obsession with that character. So this guy and I made eye-contact from across this field and I had a line of people that were waiting to get autographs and he waited at the end of the line and came through the line. We made small talk and I was talking to him and he held out a picture for me to sign and I just grabbed his hand and wrote my number down.\n\n \n\nAre you serious?\n\nI’m not kidding. That’s the one time that I’ve done anything bold like that in my entire life. But he looked so much like Denny, come one!\n\n \n\nI don’t even know who Denny is. I’m sorry.\n\nOk, well he was the best character that ever existed on Grey’s Anatomy. He was the one for Izzy. She would’ve been happy forever if he hadn’t died, but he died tragically of a heart condition.\n\n \n\nOh, I shouldn’t be laughing but it’s so funny.\n\nHe was so sweet, and he was played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan (who is my favorite actor). He’s tragic. He always plays people who die because he’s a wonderful actor and you don’t want to see him die so he always does.\n\n \n\nSo what happened with that relationship? The guy called you, then what?\n\nOh, I didn’t follow through. I think I was like, “Get a hold of yourself! You just wrote your number on a stranger’s hand. Get yourself together.”\n\n \n\nLet me ask you, finally we have this whole Taylor Nation thing going on, about your run-ins with your fans, I’m sure you’ve encountered fans that have been like, gasping for breath, passing out, crying hysterically. Give me a good story about that.\n\nI get a lot of criers, and I love criers because I like emotional people. Some artists are very uncomfortable when people cry but I happen to think it’s the cutest thing on the planet when someone meets me and starts crying. Sometimes I get gropers though. Like, I hug everyone that comes through my meet and greet line, sometimes they don’t let go.\n\n \n\nI saw some photos on your website of you meeting fans, and you really get into it.\n\nYeah, well I love to hug them and I love to thank them for coming. I was a fan, I went to concerts and I went through meet and greet lines and I know what it’s like to walk away and think that you didn’t really make an impression on your favorite artist and that you were kind of just in a line. I never want anyone leaving my concert feeling like I didn’t appreciate them coming with everything that I have. I like to hug them and I like to talk to them and I like to have conversations with them and I like to look at them in the eye. Sometimes there’s one that doesn’t let go, really tight grip…\n\n \n\nIs there like a three-second rule or something?\n\nNo, there’s no three-second rule. I think when it gets above ten to fifteen seconds, then it’s a little excessive. I, in general, love hugs and I love huggers. I think I’ve been really lucky because I haven’t had that many crazy people at all. The craziest fan gift I got was one time this guy gave me this giant turtle shell with my face painted on it.\n\n \n\nSo, to make an impression, you should look like Jeffrey Dean Morgan, cry a lot, and you’re all good, right?\n\nSometimes they show me their freshly-tattooed arms or midriffs that have my signature there for life. That’s always an interesting moment for me.",

      "Transcript/Content": "UNCASVILLE, Conn.: Taylor Swift remembers the day she walked into one of her writing sessions — filled with anger.\n\nThe boy she liked was acting up, and the singer could barely get out a greeting before unloading her frustration on co-writer Liz Rose.\n\n“I walked into Liz’s house, and I said, ‘I can’t believe what’s going on right now, I’ve gotta tell you about this.’ I told her all about it,” says Swift. “She goes, ‘If you could say everything you were thinking to him right now, what would you start with?'”\n\nSo Swift began venting: “I would say to him, ‘I’m sick and tired of your attitude, I feel like I don’t even know you’ … and I just started rambling, and she was writing down everything that I was saying, and so, we turned it into a song.”\n\nThat song, “Tell Me Why,” on her hotly anticipated sophomore CD, “Fearless,” is an example of why Swift is not only one of country music’s brightest and most popular young stars, but is also poised to become pop’s next superstar act — just weeks away from her 19th birthday.\n\n“I think the reason why all of that has started happening is because I was writing about what was happening in my life and I don’t hold back on details and I mention people’s names and I like my songs really personal,” Swift said in an interview on her swank tour bus, a few hours before a recent concert at the Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut.\n\n“I guess when you write your songs like you’re writing in a diary, more people can relate to it than you think. I thought because my songs were so personal that nobody would be able to relate to them … because I said all these names that were only significant to me,” she says. “But apparently they were significant to more people than just me.”\n\nSince Swift made her debut in 2006 with her self-titled CD, she’s sold 3 million albums and scored country hits such as “Our Song” and “Picture to Burn.” She has also become one of the few recent country singers whose celebrity has translated to a mainstream audience.\n\nMTV — not known for supporting country music — tapped her to host a week on “TRL,” and she was also their red-carpet reporter at the recent MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nShe’s graced the cover of celebrity magazines like Us Weekly, and “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” dedicated an entire show to her new album release. (During the show, Swift dished about her recent breakup with Jonas Brothers’ heartthrob Joe).\n\nSwift has a line of dolls in her likeness, recently performed with Def Leppard on a CMT special, sang the national anthem during the World Series and is planning a line of sundresses for Wal-Mart.\n\nBut the teen, who was raised in Pennsylvania and now lives in the Nashville, Tenn., area with her parents and younger brother, doesn’t play up her crossover success.\n\n“I try to look at what has happened to my career less as crossover and more as spillover,” says Swift, as her mother, Andrea, sits in the next room.\n\n“I’d like to think that country music is where I live, country music is who I am, but I’m lucky enough to have other people listening who aren’t necessarily core country music fans,” she says. “The reason why all of that has started happening is because I was writing about what was happening in my life.”\n\nLike most 18-year-old girls, Swift is focused on boys and relationships. On “Fearless,” due out Tuesday, there are songs that touch on the dreams of that fairy-tale romance (like the current hit “Love Story,”) the guy who doesn’t know you exist (“You Belong With Me”), the bad guy you fall in love with (“The Way I Loved You”) and, of course, the jerk (“You’re Not Sorry”).\n\n“I’m very fascinated by boys and love and relationships, so the boys that came in and out of my life over the past two years definitely shaped this record,” Swift says.\n\nWhat distinguishes Swift from her peers is her gift for songwriting. Swift, who also plays guitar, wrote or co-wrote every song on her first CD. On her latest album, she has even more songs that feature just her name as the songwriter.\n\nColbie Caillat, who co-wrote the tune “Breathe” on the CD, says: “The fact that she’s been writing songs since she was 13 or 14 is amazing. They are straight from her heart. It’s what she was going through, what she’s thinking about.”\n\nWhile the songs reflect the thoughts of a teenager, they are written with a sophistication that songwriters years older have yet to master. What could seem like youthful musings become, via Swift’s pen, complex stories that are also relatable to adults decades older. It’s one reason why publishing company Sony ATV made her the youngest songwriter they had ever signed.\n\nIt’s also why Swift, at 15, walked away from a development deal with RCA Records because the company wasn’t interested in her recording her own songs.\n\n“You don’t just walk away from a big record label like that when you’re an unsigned artist,” Swift says. “But I had a gut feeling about it, and some of the best decisions I’ve made in my career have been based on solely gut feelings and my instinct.”\n\n“Sometimes you don’t have a sure answer as to where you’re going to go or where you’re going to end up, but if you have an instinct as to where you don’t need to be, you need to follow it and my parents let me make that decision completely,” she says.\n\nSwift seems to be charting her own course, doing everything from tracking her profits to designing her album booklet: “I absolutely want to have my hands on everything that has to do with my career.”\n\nShe says her stockbroker dad and stay-at-home mom never pushed her into a childhood of performing, which included singing at minor-league baseball games and singing in small clubs when she was barely a teen.\n\nHer mother echoes that — describing Swift as an “oddball in Pennsylvania” who had trouble fitting in because of her love of country and her quest to become a singer-songwriter. When the family moved to Nashville to help Swift pursue her dreams, they made sure she didn’t go to a school attended by children of industry insiders.\n\n“I wanted there to be an escape hatch,” she says. “I never wanted it to drive her crazy.”\n\nBut Taylor, whom Andrea Swift describes as a perfectionist, never lost sight of her goal. As she watches her daughter rehearse like a seasoned pro for her opening act on a bill with Rascal Flatts, she says: “There’s now a level of confidence because now she knows she has attained a certain level of success.”\n\nStill, Swift has kept her teenage exuberance. Personable with a quick wit, she spends most of her free time on the computer, making humorous clips for the Web, and proudly shows off her latest work on her laptop. And she talks about hanging out with her three best friends — fellow country singer Kellie Pickler, actress Selena Gomez and a high school friend named Abigail, who pops up as a character on her new record.\n\n“I still hang out with the best friend that I had in ninth grade … I still get caught up on all the gossip of what’s going on in my hometown whenever I’m back, and I honestly feel like I’m an 18-year-old girl,” she says. “When I’m in business meetings, I’m not an 18-year-old girl, but when I step out of those meetings, I get to be 18 again.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Cut By Cut\n\nFearless\n(Taylor Swift, Liz Rose, Hillary Lindsey)\nThis is a song about the fearlessness of falling in love. No matter how many break up songs you write, no matter how many times you get hurt, you will always fall in love again. When I wrote “Fearless,” I wasn’t dating anyone. I wasn’t even in the beginning stages of dating anybody. I really was all by myself out on tour and I got this idea for a song about the best first date. I think sometimes when you’re writing love songs, you don’t write them about what you’re going through at the moment, you write about what you wish you had. So, this song is about the best first date I haven't had yet.\n\nFifteen\n(Taylor Swift)\nI wrote this around the story line of my best friend from high school, Abigail. I started everything with the line “Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind” and wrote everything else from that point, almost backwards. I just decided I really wanted to tell that story about our first year of high school because I felt in my freshman year, I grew up more than any year in my life so far.\n\nLove Story\n(Taylor Swift)\nThis is a song I wrote when I was dating a guy who wasn't exactly the popular choice. His situation was a little complicated, but I didn't care. I started this song with the line \"This love is difficult, but it's real.\" When I wrote the ending to this song, I felt like it was the ending every girl wants to go with her love story. It’s the ending that I want. You want a guy who doesn’t care what anyone thinks, what anyone says. He just says, “Marry me, Juliet, I love you, and that’s all I really know.” It’s sort of told in a character kind of thing, where it’s Romeo and Juliet, and it’s not me saying that I’m getting married or anything...but I think it’s fun to write about it.\n\nHey Stephen\n(Taylor Swift)\nWe were recording at John McBride’s (Martina McBride’s husband’s) studio and he was like, ‘My kids are dying to meet you. Do you think that you could say hi to them?’ I said, ‘Sure, have them come and hang out while we’re recording.’ So his daughters and their friends from school – there were about ten of them there – they all came into the studio when we were recording “Hey Stephen” and they loved it. They were singing along with it by the end of it.\n\nWhite Horse\n(Taylor Swift, Liz Rose)\nI actually wasn’t going to put this song on the album. I was going to wait for the third album because I really felt like we had the “sadness” represented on this record. Then my agency out in LA set up a meeting with executive producers Betsy Beers and Shonda Rhimes at Grey’s Anatomy because that’s my favorite show. It would just be a dream come true to have a song on it. So, I played them “White Horse.” It was just me and my guitar and they freaked out. They loved it. They said, “We’ll get back to you as soon as possible.” For a while, we didn’t know if we were going to put it on the record because if it wasn’t going to be on the show, then we weren’t going to put it on the album. Then they called and said they were very interested in the song. We recorded it right away, sent it off to them, and they put it in!\n\nTo me, “White Horse” is about what, in my opinion, is the most heart-breaking part of a break-up – that moment when you realize that all the dreams you had, all those visions you had of being with this person, all that disappears. Everything after that moment is moving on.. But that initial moment of \"Wow, it's over\" is what I wrote \"White Horse\" about.\n\nYou Belong With Me\n(Taylor Swift, Liz Rose)\nI came into the writing session with Liz Rose and said….I’ve got this idea. I had overheard a friend of mine talking to his girlfriend and he was completely on the defensive saying, “No, baby...I had to get off the phone really quickly...I tried to call you right back...Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry.” She was just yelling at him! I felt so bad for him at that moment.\n\nSo I came up with the first line “You’re on the phone with your girlfriend, she’s upset, going off about something that you said,” and I ran that into the story line that I’m in love with him and he should be with me instead of her. It just became this whole picture. It was really fun for us to write the line, “She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts.”\n\nBreathe\n(Taylor Swift, Colbie Calliat)\nIt’s a song about having to say goodbye to somebody, but it never blames anybody. Sometimes that’s the most difficult part. When it’s nobody’s fault.\n\nI was a huge fan of Colbie’s record. When it came out, I fell in love with the way that she makes music. I contacted her management right away and I asked if I could write with her and, sure enough, Colbie had a date coming up in Nashville where she was going to be playing a show and she had the day off. I think she sounds beautiful on it. I’m so excited to have her voice on my album.\n\nTell Me Why\n(Taylor Swift, Liz Rose)\nI’d been talking to a guy I’ve never “officially” dated. Sometimes it’s the hardest thing when you have all these dreams of dating them, and you’re getting close, but it doesn’t work out. He would say things that would make me go, “Did you just say that?” It bothered me so much because he would say one thing and do another, do one thing and say another. Because he didn’t know what he wanted, he would just play all these mind games.\n\nSo I went over to write with Liz and was just ranting and raving about how this guy is such a flake and such a jerk sometimes, and so cool other times. I was like, “Liz, I don’t know what’s up with this guy!” So I just started playing the beginning, “I took a chance, I took a shot. And you might think I’m bulletproof, but I’m not.”\n\nYou’re Not Sorry\n(Taylor Swift)\nIt is about this guy who turned out to not be who I thought I was. He came across as prince charming. Well, it turned out prince charming had a lot of secrets that he didn’t tell me about. And one by one, I would figure them out. I would find out who he really was. I wrote this when I was at the breaking point of, “You know what? Don’t even think that you can keep on hurting me.” It was to a point where I had to walk away.\n\nThe Way I Loved You\n(Taylor Swift, John Rich)\nI got this idea for a song about being in a relationship with a nice guy who is punctual and opens up the door for you and brings you flowers...but you feel nothing. The whole time you’re with him, you’re thinking about the guy who was complicated and messy and frustrating.\n\nSo I brought that idea, the title and where I thought the song should go to John. He was able to relate to it because he is that complicated, frustrating messy guy in his relationships. We came at the song from different angles. It was just so cool to get in a room and write with him because he really is an incredible writer.\n\nForever & Always\n(Taylor Swift)\n“Forever & Always” is about when I was in a relationship with someone and I was just watching him slowly slip away. I didn't know why, because I wasn't doing anything different. I didn't do anything wrong. He was just fading. It’s about the confusion and frustration of wondering why? What changed? When did it change? What did I do wrong? In this case, the guy I wrote it about ended up breaking up with me for another girl. Guess I know why he was fading..\n\nThe Best Day\n(Taylor Swift)\nI wrote this song on the road and didn’t tell my mom about it. I decided that I was going to keep it a secret and give it to her as a surprise for Christmas. I wrote it in the summer and then recorded it secretly with the band in the studio. After it was done, I synched the song up to all these home videos of her, and my family.\n\nShe didn’t even realize it was me singing until halfway through the song! She didn’t have any idea that I could possibly write and record a song without her knowing about it. When she finally got it, she just started bawling her eyes out.\n\nChange\n(Taylor Swift)\nAt one point, I began to understand that it would be harder for me on a smaller record label to get to the places and accomplish the things that artists were accomplishing on bigger record labels. I realized that I wouldn’t get favors pulled for me because there weren’t any other artists on the label to pull favors from. It was going to be an uphill climb and all that I had to encourage me was the hope that someday things would change. That things would be different. After so many times of just saying that to myself over and over, I finally wrote it down in a song.",

      "Transcript/Content": "cmt.com: Taylor Swift’s Fascination With Fairy Tales Comes Through on New Album\n\nSinger-Songwriter Returns With Fearless, “Love Story”\n\nNovember 10, 2008; Written by Lindsey Roznovsky\n\nIn the last few years, Taylor Swift has made the leap from being a teenage girl who writes songs about breakups to … a very famous teenage girl who writes songs about break-ups. (Sometimes it all works out, though, as in her newest single, “Love Story.”) After selling 3.5 million copies of her debut album, the vivacious singer-songwriter returns with her second album, Fearless, which will be released Tuesday (Nov. 11).\n\nIn this interview with CMT Radio, the 18-year-old country star talks about her fascination with fairy tales, the story behind “Fifteen” and what was going through her head when she was 5 years old.\n\nCMT: A couple of themes in the album stood out when we were listening to it. One is the princess theme.\n\nSwift: I am completely fascinated by the differences and comparisons between real life and fairy tales because we’re raised as little girls to think that we’re a princess and that Prince Charming is going to sweep us off our feet. And that we’re going to ride off into the sunset on a white horse. We’re not really expecting to get blown off or ignored or broken up with or cheated on. … I think it’s really interesting when you come to terms with that reality: “Maybe that’s not gonna happen with this guy because this guy’s a jerk.”\n\n\nBut there’s still that core of us that believes that it’s true and that if you find the right person, you can have that love story and it can work out. So there are different examples of fairy tales, and sometimes I believe in them and sometimes I don’t. And moments on the record like in “White Horse,” it’s a song about, “Wow, this is not a fairy tale, is it? Awesome. Great.” It’s (about how) I’m coming to this realization that this is not a fairy tale at all — this is real life. And then there’s “Love Story,” which is about the complete optimist. This is a love story: “Say yes, and everything will be fine forever, and it will be perfect, and we’ll have a happy ending.” I think it’s important to keep both sides of that. You know, to kind of be a little skeptical of it, but then if you meet the right person, just to believe it will be perfect.\n\n \n\nWhat was your favorite fairy tale growing up?\n\n \n\nThis isn’t a fairy tale, it’s Shakespeare, but Romeo and Juliet were always my favorite couple because they didn’t care, and they loved each other no matter what. And it was always my favorite — except for the ending. So with “Love Story,” I just took my favorite characters and gave them the ending that they deserve.\n\n \n\nIs “The Best Day” about your mom?\n\n \n\nIt is. In the first verse, I was talking about being 5 years old, so as a writer, it was really fun to go back to that place of the way that I used to talk when I was 5. I wrote the song from that perspective, and I starting thinking, “What would I be thinking if I was 5 and I was remembering this?” And it goes, “I’m 5 years old/It’s getting cold and I’ve got my big coat on.” It had language like that — that makes me really think back to that time. I actually wrote that song without telling my mom and recorded it without telling my mom. Complete secret session. Then I got the track back and synced up all these home videos of me when I was a little kid and made this video and played it for my mom on Christmas and said, “Merry Christmas!” She had no idea that it was me singing for the first half of the song. And then she just broke down crying when she realized I had done this whole thing to surprise her. It was a really cool moment.\n\n \n\nDid you cry when you recorded it?\n\n \n\nNo, the one I cried during was “Fifteen.” That’s a song about my best friend. I’m not likely to cry over something I’ve gone through, even if it’s the worst breakup ever. Maybe I haven’t had that breakup yet. Maybe there will be a breakup where I’ll just cry every time I think of it. (laughs) But the things that make me cry are when the people I love have gone through pain and I’ve seen it. “Fifteen” talks about how my best friend, Abigail, got her heart broken when we were in ninth grade and singing about that absolutely gets me every time.\n\n \n\nAnother theme on the record is kissing. In “The Way I Love You,” it talks about …\n\n \n\nScreaming and fighting, kissing in the rain. And in “Fearless” — “It’s a first kiss/It’s flawless.” Yeah, I’m fascinated by the theme of love and kissing and breaking up and fairy tales and boys. That’s what I love to write songs about. It’s funny how you can mention one thing, like kissing, and have it be completely different in each song and have it mean a different thing.\n\n \n\nWhen you have a relationship starting, do you think about certain moments, like when you say “I love you” for the first time? Do you have dream ideas about what you want all that to be like?\n\n \n\nI am a complete hopeless romantic. And I think that you can’t be too neurotic about love. You can’t plan everything out. I think that one of the cool things about love is that the spontaneity of it is what makes it so magical. I think the coolest way to have a first kiss is when you’re in the middle of a sentence, and you’re rambling on about something, and the guy looks over and just kisses you, and you’re not expecting it. Like, you’re not planning that. That’s not underneath a terrace, underneath the moonlight with a shooting star running across the sky and everything’s perfect. I think the perfection of love is that it’s not perfect.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Record execs warned Taylor Swift she was going to have to have a thick skin to succeed in the music business. But having a thin skin has served her just as well.\n\n“I just feel things. I let myself feel things. I live my life based on feelings,” Swift said during her bus tour last month. And because she gets overly emotional about heartache and is easily offended by mean girls, she turns those moments of fragility into the kind of country music women understand. So her new album, “Fearless,” out Tuesday, has tune after tune about the passions of the Everygirl.\n\n\nNot quite 19, Swift hasn’t had an entire lifetime of love and loss to pull from. She is, however, in a constant state of observation, so she’s able to pull from other people’s relationships.\n\nHer best friend Abigail’s decision to give everything she had to a boy became a big part of the midtempo “Fifteen.” Last week she revealed that she had penned the tune “Forever &Always” about her breakup with Joe Jonas of the Jonas Brothers. And meeting Mr. Right became “The Way I Loved You.”\n\n“I was talking to this guy who was polite and sensible and logical and the kind that, you know, you want to end up with,” Swift remembered. “But somehow it doesn’t connect in the same way as the frustrated, complicated, volatile relationship.”\n\nShe harnessed that dichotomy and brought it to a writing session with John Rich (from the country duo Big & Rich). “The verses are robotic. And they’re playing a marching band snare drum roll to make it seem like the guy is so robotic. Then the chorus goes insane and the drums start spinning out of control,” she said. So it’s not just her mental diary that’s helping her create such memorable music. It’s a gut instinct for pop-leaning country arrangements.\n\nMusic like that will undoubtedly maintain Swift’s status as a darling of country radio.\n\n“Taylor can make me remember what it was like to be in high school,” said Marci Braun, music director/assistant program director for Chicago’s WUSN-FM 99.5. “She’s a stellar storyteller.” Calling Swift the fresh face of the format, Braun added that her live shows also keep the connection between Swift and her fans strong.\n\nSwift said she wanted to branch out a little bit musically and put some different sounds on this album. So “Hey Steven” fuses an upright bass with a gut string guitar. There’s some major piano on “You’re Not Sorry.” Then on “The Best Day,” Swift wanted a coffeehouse folkish beat. “My producer put this beautiful mandolin and dobro part on the song. But I had him bury them in the track so far that you can barely even hear them ‘cause I wanted the song to be simple.”\n\nThose little nuances are there on just about every track, because Swift tends to compose them that way in her head.\n\nProducer Nathan Chapman said that even though Swift is a perfectionist about those intricacies, she is very easygoing in the studio. “Her instincts about how to make the music are just really natural,” he said.\n\nHis goal with this album was to make it sound like Swift was in the room with the listener. “Sometimes for big radio hits you put a lot of stuff in, but a lot of the tracks on ‘Fearless’ are really simple,” Chapman added.\n\nThis time around, she wrote eight of the tunes by herself and the other five with some of Nashville’s most sought-after songwriters.\n\nOn “Fifteen,” Chapman said they reached outside Nashville’s country scene to find cello player Claire Indie to give that song an almost orchestral sound. And even Swift’s voice has bulked up and sounds less tentative than when she debuted two years, 3.4 million albums and 7.5 million downloads ago.\n\nBut Swift knows she may always have a few critics, ones who claim her voice isn’t as pure or strong as it should be. But her thick skin prevails. “I think the first couple of times people say you can’t sing, it gets to you. But then you have to start putting more importance on the positive. I’m not trying to be the best singer in the world,” she said. “I’m just writing songs in my bedroom and putting them on albums.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "11 Questions With Taylor Swift\nThe Boot Staff\n\nPublished: January 10, 2009\n\nWith her string of infectious hits, her good looks and uncanny talent, Taylor Swift has become one of the most famous faces in music today. The singing/songwriting sensation, this week's musical guest on 'Saturday Night Live,' also has a sparkling personality to match. The Boot sat down with Swift for a candid chat about high school, her famous friends and the pact she made before she herself was famous.\n\nWhat has been your most embarrassing moment?\nI have them all the time! Mostly it has to do with me being tall. I'll always be hitting my head on the side of a car or going through a door. I think I've gotten minor concussions from hitting my head on things. And in the beginning, when I was on the radio tour and doing free shows, people would introduce me as Taylor Hicks, because that was right when he won 'American Idol.'\n\nYou have a cameo in the upcoming 'Hannah Montana' movie. Do you have any acting aspirations?\nAs far as acting is concerned, I would love to do it if was very well written and witty. I would love to be on 'Grey's Anatomy' in some sort of supporting role. That would be my absolute dream.\n\nIf you could have dinner with anybody, who would it be?\n\nEllen DeGeneres. Every time I've been on her show, I've had the most fun ever. I think she has such talent for bringing out the best stories and the best part of your personality. That social dynamic is something I'd love to learn.\n\nYou've met a lot of your musical heroes. Who stands out?\nFaith Hill. Every time Faith talks to me, she's incredibly sweet. It just blows me away that she can be so incredibly beautiful and talented and such a huge star, and be so down to earth and humble. Also, Nicole Kidman blew me away when I met her. She was so gracious and sweet, and I love that about her.\n\nWhat's the most unusual thing in your purse?\nI was so proud of this in high school -- I won the best dissector award in biology. I have that little piece of paper in my wallet, from 9th grade ... Surgery and biology have always been really fascinating to me, so I was really excited that they thought I had like the most potential as a surgeon.\n\nDo you ever wish you were older?\nNo, actually it's quite the contrary. I'm not sitting here thinking I wish I could go out for a drink tonight, that's not where I am in my life. I'm not 18 wishing I was 25. I'm happy in this moment. I'm not trying to be older and get to do things that older people do. When that moment happens, I'll live in that moment. But right now this moment is the best moment I've lived in my entire life.\n\n\nYou made a pact to get a heart tattoo on your foot if your debut album went double platinum. It has actually gone quadruple platinum now, so have you gotten inked?\nIt's still up in the air.There's that little voice in the back of my head -- actually it's my dad -- saying, 'I'll take it off with a belt sander if you get that tattoo!' So I'm thinking about it, weighing my options. I'm really excited about going triple platinum. Obviously I didn't expect to or I wouldn't have made a pact to get a tattoo!\n\nWhat is your favorite movie?\nIt's 'Love Actually,' because it's all these different angles of love and relationships. It takes place around Christmas time and you see how all these different people are in all these different situations, and the way that it coincides is just brilliant. I think that that movie has inspired me in so many different ways in just seeing how all these different things could be going on in these people's lives. It's this huge quilt of stories, and I love that.\n\nIf you hadn't made it as a singer/songwriter, what career path do you think you'd be taking?\nI would have either been in business with creative ads, or gone in a completely different direction of criminology or surgery. I don't know. It's very interesting because the ad thing would have been creative, but the other two are completely logic and the other side of things. It's weird. I'm all over the place.\n\nNow that you've graduated high school, will you move into your own home?\n\nI'll be staying at home for a few more years. I'm never home anyway, and my parents and I get along so well. I think everybody's afraid of me growing up too fast, and I'm afraid of that, too. I really love my parents, and I like watching my brother grow up. I don't have lots of opportunities to pick him up from school or see him go off to his dances. So when I'm home, I want to witness whatever normalcy I can.\n\nDo you plan to go to college?\nObviously I want to be as knowledgeable as possible, know as many aspects of life as I can and be well rounded. College is one way that can happen. But I think traveling around the country and getting to shake hands with people I've looked up to my entire life, and writing songs and co-producing an album makes you well rounded, too. I'm not gonna shut doors and say that I'm never going to college, but right now, I'm not gonna walk away from something that I'm so lucky to have.\n\n",

      "Transcript/Content": "Love in Spotlight Brings Pain, Inspiration\n\nRiding the emotional roller coaster of young love is difficult enough without having to do it in the national spotlight.\n\nTaylor Swift, 18, has quickly discovered that there’s great media interest in her dates, especially if they are famous, like her recent flame, Joe Jonas of the Jonas Brothers. Although Swift was tight-lipped during their relationship — she didn’t confirm that the two were an item — Us magazine reported that he recently broke up with her over the telephone.\n\nInitially, Swift didn’t comment, but perhaps because she’s 18, or maybe because she’s human, she couldn’t resist a few public digs. On her MySpace video, she held up the Joe Jonas doll and said, “See, this one even comes with a phone. So he can break up with other dolls.”\n\nSwift says, “Dating people who have security guards and entire entourages of their own is weird. It’s a new thing for me.\n\n“I think that I am willing to make relationships work if they are willing to make relationships work. If it is a guy I am dating who is in college in Alabama, I will make it work and I’ll go fly to see him when I can and I’ll fly him out to see me when he has time off.\n\n“If I’m dating somebody who is doing exactly what I’m doing, we’ll fly to each other’s tour dates. If I am dating somebody who lives across the country, there are ways to make it work no matter what.\n\n“I will always believe in love and I don’t care what happens to me or how many times I get my heart broken, or how many breakup songs I write, I’m always going to believe that someday I am going to meet somebody who is actually right for me and he’s going to be wonderful and it’s going to work out.”\n\nGetting Even Through Song\n\nSwift said she hasn’t seen an increase in men asking her out since she’s turned 18 last December.\n\n“No, I don’t get a lot of people hitting on me, actually,” she said. “I get the sweetest, most adorable guys that come to my shows and hold up signs that say, ‘Marry me,’ but other than that, there aren’t a lot of guys that are lined up at my door asking me out just because I’m 18 now. I think they are all scared off because they’ll know I’ll write a song about them if they break up with me or do something bad.”\n\nFor instance, “Teardrops on My Guitar” was her personal unrequited love story about a boy she liked, “but I couldn’t tell him.” She said, “He had a girlfriend and I was definitely in the friend zone. He would tell me all about his girlfriend and how happy they were.”\n\nJonas’ timing may have been unfortunate — for him. Had he waited a few weeks before ending things, her recording deadline would have passed and she wouldn’t have been able to write and record a song about him on her new album, Fearless. If he had waited even longer, her interviews would have passed with Ryan Seacrest, Ellen DeGeneres and others in which they discussed how he ended things.\n\nInstead, she wrote “Forever & Always” while in London in late September.\n\n“It’s about watching someone completely slip away from you in a relationship and you don’t know what you are doing wrong. You don’t know why, but they are fading fast,” she said. “It’s that confusion and that, ‘You said that you wanted to be with me forever and now you’re halfway out the door. What’s going on?’ So, I wrote that song and I’m really proud of it.”\n\nLast year, Swift wrote her current hit, “Love Story” about another real-life love interest, one who wasn’t the popular choice of those around her. “I felt like I was the only one who believed that it was the right thing, so I started going through this thought in my head, ‘This is difficult but it’s real.’\n\n“It’s all very true to how this whole thing went with, ‘See the light, see the party, the ball gown, see you make your way through the crowd and say hello.’ It’s all very true to what happened, except for the ending. I decided to make it an ending that I want, the ending that every girl wants: for the guy to drop down on one knee and say, ‘I love you. That is all I really know. I don’t care about anything else. Go pick out a white dress.’ “\n\nWas everyone else right about him?\n\n“I don’t know. I stopped talking to him. You never know if it was right or not. That’s the thing about being the one who says goodbye to people. You don’t know if you made the right choice. So every time I sing that song, I’m wondering.”\n\nFriend Pickler Helps Ease Heartbreak\n\nAlthough Swift may sometimes show a brave face, her heart still breaks just as deeply as other teens’. She often turns to her close friend, country singer Kellie Pickler, to help her get over breakups.\n\n“She has a different way of being a friend and giving advice than I do,” she says. “When Kellie is going through a breakup, my advice to her is always very practical and I lay out 10-15 logical reasons why he was not right for her and when I started seeing the signs that it wasn’t a good match and here is why you should get over it. Here is a 50-song play list that I created for you that I’m going to upload to your iPod.\n\n“With Kellie, she just finds something about the guy to make fun of and gives him a nickname and won’t refer to him as his name any longer, only the mean nickname. She will always make fun of him until I can’t remember why I dated him in the first place. She is absolutely the funniest person I’ve ever been around and she uses comedy to get over anything I’m not over.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift, a slender, pale eighteen-year-old with curly blond hair that hangs in long tresses, is one of the biggest young stars in popular music. I recently caught her at an arena in St. Paul, where she opened for the country trio Rascal Flatts. Before the show, she chatted calmly with her mother, Andrea. “So the hockey team is the Wild or the Wilds?” Taylor asked a stagehand as she prepared her between-song patter. A few minutes later, the crowd cheered as she came onstage in a sleeveless, calf-length goldsequinned dress, and the cheering continued throughout her performance. It became obvious that she and Rascal Flatts had equal claims on the room. Strutting across stage platforms, performing a percussion duet on garbage cans, and switching gears without pause—her voice, all the while, light and breathy and without affectation—she returned the crowd’s energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen, when she was signed as a songwriter to Sony/ATV Music Publishing, in Nashville.\n\n\n\nThe music industry’s collapse may have seemed like a dress rehearsal for the current financial meltdown, but there are still stars in the business, and there is an interesting trend in both number and gender: the popular groups are male—Nickelback, Coldplay, the Eagles. The solo stars now, though, are more likely to be women: Alicia Keys, Carrie Underwood, Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Taylor Swift (who probably won’t need that surname for long). Her self-titled début album, released when she was sixteen, has been on the charts for two years. It is triple platinum and still rests, impressively, at No. 31 on the Billboard 200. Swift wrote or co-wrote every song on the album, one when she was twelve. Her second album, “Fearless,” will be released on November 11th, and has already delivered two singles to the upper reaches of the charts: “Fearless” is at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100, and “Love Story” is at No. 14. Short samples of both songs were available for streaming on Swift’s MySpace page weeks before they hit radio, and that page has garnered more than ninety million plays. After her St. Paul show, she changed into sweatpants, curled up inside a silk comforter on her tour-bus couch, and checked her page for new comments from fans, which she answers herself. (She was soon distracted by her iPod Touch.)\n\nOne aspect of Swift’s story is timeless, and could have happened during any decade in the last century. Her talent as a songwriter and singer was obvious enough to her parents that they moved their family from Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, to Hendersonville, Tennessee, when she was thirteen. Though prodigies are always surprising, the surprise is only in degree, not category; what is surprising about Swift is her indifference to category or genre. She is considered part of Nashville’s country-pop tradition only because she writes narrative songs with melodic clarity and dramatic shape—Nashville’s stock-in-trade. But such songs also crop up in R. & B. and rap and rock. It is evidence of her ear that she not only identifies with songs in other genres but performs them, even though Nashville is a musically conservative place. It is only superficially jarring that Swift, the “country” artist, has covered Eminem’s “Lose Yourself” and Beyoncé’s “Irreplaceable” in concert. Both are fat-free, unerring pieces of songwriting. Swift is not an agent of revolution; she, much like Beyoncé, is a preternaturally skilled student of established values. Her precociousness isn’t about her chart success, but lies in the quality of her work, how fully she’s absorbed the lessons of her elders and how little she seems to care which radio format will eventually claim her. Change the beat and the instruments around the voice, and her songs could work anywhere.\n\nYou could also give a Swift composition like “Our Song” to someone twenty years older and it could work just fine. The concerns of kids aren’t necessarily juvenile—just their reactions. Bridging this gap is the trick of pop music; when people sing “Love Me Do” to themselves on their way to a date ten years on the other side of their second divorce, it’s a sign that a young songwriter has got to a universal truth. This kind of precocious wisdom is embedded in the work of songwriters like Hank Williams, Prince, Elvis Costello, and Randy Newman. People who aren’t old enough to have lived the songs they’ve written nevertheless know how the song embodying that life should go.\n\n“Our Song” was not Swift’s first hit, but it was the first to stop me in my tracks. It’s a breezy recounting of frustration, streaked with simple phrases so conversational that on first hearing they fly by without registering. For example: “He’s got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel, the other on my heart.” Not one hand here and another there; first comes a “one-hand feel,” and then the asymmetrical “hand”—on someone else’s heart, not his own. The song’s tension is that Swift and her man don’t have a song to call their own; its genius is that they never pick one—their romance is the song, and both characters get a chance to narrate. Swift, the writer, also gets to transubstantiate; their song is their life as she describes it. He says, “Our song is the slamming screen door, sneakin’ out late, tapping on your window.” She says, “Our song is the way he laughs, the first date, man, I didn’t kiss him, and I could have.” There may be two characters, but there’s only one songwriter, and this time the writer is keeping pretty august company: “And when I got home, before I said amen, asking God if he could play it again.” Life is their song, a lark in a car, with the Deity himself co-writing.\n\nSwift’s new release is one of the few albums I can imagine selling truly astonishing numbers in today’s timid, parched market. While Swift’s début was a happy shock, driven by several unexpectedly good songs, “Fearless” is a streamlined machine without a bad track, appropriate for all ages and demographics. Cynics may be able to resist it, precisely because the marks are all hit so deliberately. “The Best Day” will dissolve anyone with children, and might become the official Mother’s Day song. (It’s sung to her mom.) The album’s finest effort, “Fifteen,” will feature in yearbook quotes for years.\n\nIn that song, Swift has unpacked the emotional math of being fifteen. The mood is undecided, switching among remorse, reflection, and an understanding that belongs as much to adults as it does to the tweens who will be performing renditions on YouTube the day the album is released. “ ’Cause when you’re fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you’re gonna believe them” is the first line of the chorus, and it sounds much more like the comforting words of a parent than like the quixotic pride of a young romantic. When the redheaded best friend, Abigail, is disappointed by a boy, Swift drops back, underplaying a sorrow that probably felt like surgery without anesthesia: “Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind, and we both cried.” In weaker hands, this song would be littered with broken hearts; Swift’s boy just “changed his mind.” In twenty years, when Swift has a songbook as long as her hair, “Fifteen” will sound no different. Will Swift sing to her daughter then the way she sings to her mother now? ",

      "Transcript/Content": "Washington Post: CMAs: Taylor Swift’s Big Night Out\n\nBy J. Freedom du Lac |  November 12, 2008\n\nNASHVILLE — Taylor Swift had a minor crisis midway through her meal at last night’s BMI Awards: Her Shirley Temple was served in a lowball glass that might have given people the impression that the 18-year-old crossover country star with the squeaky-clean image was throwing back an Old Fashioned.\n\n“Look at it,” she said of the nonalcoholic drink. “I just can’t do it. I need a straw.”\n\nThe head of Swift’s record label secured one, and Swift finally took a celebratory sip.\n\n\nThere was much for her to celebrate on Tuesday.\n\n“Fearless,” the terrific, hit-packed sophomore album from the hugely talented high school senior, was released yesterday to great acclaim.\n\nThough Swift had trouble going to sleep the night before because, she said, “I didn’t know if anybody would buy my album,” the early indicators were excellent: Big Machine Records honcho Scott Borchetta — who’d signed Swift to his nascent label and then watched with amazement as her self-titled debut sold 3.5 million copies — said last night that first-week sales looked to be “north of 500,000.”\n\nIn fact, he said, based on release-day data from major retailers, 600,000 was well within reach. (One of those release-day buyers: Miley Cyrus, who told Swift that she’d gone to her local Wal-Mart at midnight to pick up the album. “That is so awesome,” Swift said.) Anyway, Borchetta joked: “I’ll have to go back and look at my original projections, from when this was just starting, but I think we’re ahead of schedule.”\n\nThere were also the writing awards from BMI, a performing rights organization: Swift received two, for her hits “Our Song” and “Teardrops on My Guitar.”\n\nAnd then, near night’s end, came the sweet coda for the country star of the moment: “Teardops” was named BMI’s country song of the year.\n\nSwift was stunned, gasping when her name was announced. On stage, she was equal parts exuberant (lots of hugs) and incredulous (it didn’t take an expert lip-reader to see that she was saying “Oh. My. God.”). When she returned to her table, etched glass trophy in hand, Swift reacted in typical teenagerly fashion. Woah!” she said. “Whaaaaaaaat?” (Her publicist captured the moment for posterity — and, of course, Swift’s MySpace page — with a digital video camera.)\n\n“I did not see that coming at ALL,” Swift said of the award. “It didn’t even go No. 1 country. It’s because of the crossover, all those spins.” She playfully stroked the trophy. “I walked up there and Hank Williams Jr. was going like this to me,” she said, thrusting her thumbs in the air. She looked at her iPhone and there was a text message from a friend sitting on the other side of the room. “Congrats,” it said. “I love you.Kenny.” As in, Chesney. “Awesome,” Swift said as she showed the message to Borchetta.\n\nHer table was wedged between Brooks and Dunn‘s and Tim McGrawand Faith Hill‘s. Keith Urban was two tables over, with Nicole Kidmanat his side. (Swift had yours truly at her side. Urban wins.)\n\nAll night, Swift had been fidgeting with the good-luck ring she’s worn since 2006. She’d made more than a few random observations and asides. “Bucky has the same hair as me,” she said as Bucky Covington bounced onto the stage for an award. “Meals on Wheels and Jeffrey Steele — that rhymed,” she whispered after BMI presidentDel Bryant riffed on country songwriters and community service. In between bites of beef filet, Swift leaned over to tell me that when she attended her first BMI Awards, she was seated with Toby Keith. “He and his manager had a speed-eating contest,” she recalled. Keith won. “It was awesome.”\n\nSwift mouthed the words to just about every BMI-honored hit, from the likes of Rascal Flatts, Miranda Lambert, Sara Evans, Jason Aldeanand Dierks Bentley.\n“I probably know them all,” she said. “Radio is like a science. You haveto be familiar with what’s working in country music.”\n\nAnd elsewhere, too, apparently: One of Swift’s current favorites is the pop singer Katy Perry. “I think she’s awesome. And I met her — she’s sooooooo nice.”\n\nShe asked me if I’d seen Kid Rock in the room. (I had.) She asked me if I’d seen a particular video on her MySpace page. (I hadn’t.) Run don’t walk, she suggested. It’s good.\n\nSwift’s fans know to check the page regularly: In a blog post Monday, she included a post-script that hinted she’d be at the Wal-Mart in Hendersonville, Tenn., at midnight to buy her new album. (She was, and so were more than a few of her fans.) Better yet, she recently posted a video that was mostly about the release of “Fearless,” but included a surprise reference to Joe Jonas, the teen idol who’d broken up with Swift on the telephone. Holding up a Joe Jonas doll that she’d received as a joke gift, Swift said: “See, this one even comes with a phone, so he can break up with other dolls.” Then, holding up a female doll, Swift jokingly cautioned: “Stay away from him, OK?”\n\nSwift hardly seemed bereft on Tuesday. Not even close. “This is my favorite time of the year,” she said cheerfully, even though she’d been in a full-on promotional sprint, having done radio interviews all day (“I went from 8:30 to 4”) before working the red carpet at the BMI Awards. This after spending most of Monday in New York (“Good Morning America,” MTV, Letterman, etc.) and then flying home and making a midnight run to Wal-Mart.\n\nTonight come the Country Music Association Awards; Swift is up for female vocalist of the year, and she’ll be performing, too. First, though, a pre-party: “Miley and I are going to hang out beforehand,” she said. Drinking Shirley Temples through straws, no doubt.\n\nhttp://voices.washingtonpost.com/postrock/2008/11/cmas_taylor_swifts_big_night_o.html",

      "Transcript/Content": "Meeting Taylor Swift\n\nBy Brinda Sullivan 11.18.08\n\nTaylor Swift is a real class act. At the age of eighteen, she has accomplished more than most people in a lifetime. She is unique and shows her rarity in the form of a song. If she is hurt, she will write about it. If she is stabbed in the back, she will sing about it. Taylor seems to live her life like an open book. No page left unturned, and all pages full of information about her life.\n\nI had the opportunity to meet Taylor when she spotted my little girl out in a crowd before a concert. She invited my daughter, my husband, and me to her tour bus. Upon arrival, Taylor gave us a big hug and welcomed us with open arms. We felt honored because she picked us out of a crowd and it was her request that we meet. Of course, it helped that our daughter was wearing a white dress like Taylor and had hair like Taylor. Her first words to my little girl were that when she saw her, she had to show her pictures of Taylor when Taylor was her age. My daughter couldn’t quit smiling.\n\n\nWe saw the snacks on her table and the unmade bunks. The tour bus showed signs of truly belonging to a teenager. It wasn’t dirty, but it wasn’t uncomfortably clean, neither to where you are afraid to touch anything. The bus was perfect. There was candy out in the open with chips and junk food, papers sitting on a sofa, and signs of the bus being “lived in.” Taylor apologized for the mess, yet didn’t mind us seeing it.\n\nDuring our visit, Taylor gave us a tour of the bus, including the bunk that she sleeps in. It had pictures of all her friends hanging in it. I thought it was perfect for a young girl. We saw the bedroom her parents sleep in, and most excitingly my daughter got a sneak peak of what Taylor would be wearing for the concert that night, and was introduced to her boot collection. We were up close and personal with her wardrobe, and it was great.\n\nTaylor Swift made us feel like she had known us her whole life. I am sure she makes everyone feel that way which is why she is so successful. She takes the time to meet people, spend time with them, and make them feel like they are a special part of her life. If you have seen her My Space page, you would have read her blogs. Her personality in her blogs is her true personality in person. She truly is grateful for her fans and she does credit her success to each and every one that has supported her, bought tickets to see her, and cheered her own through her journey. My daughter will choose Taylor Swift over Hannah Montana any day of the week. If Taylor is the future of country music, pop music, or any other kind of music, I think this world is in very good hands. Way to go, Taylor!",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Responds!\n\nBy Leigh Belz\nNovember 25, 2008\n\nMusic Blogger got the most hits ever when I announced that I was looking for questions to send on to country singer Taylor Swift. (I think there were something like 56 comments the last time I checked.)\n\nI picked ten of the best questions to pass on to Miss Swift herself and today I'm very excited to be able to post Taylor's video response. Also, don't forget to go here and enter to win Taylor's guitar!\n\nThanks to everyone who submitted questions and check back to the blog in a few days for the next round of 'Ask the Rockstar': We've got an amazing band on deck to answer your questions about their (hint hint) new December release.\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n1. Sydney asks: How has your fame affected your family's life back home?  Has your little brother reacted well to it?\n\nMy family has always been really cool because they have said to me, \"We're 100% behind this dream, but if you have another dream tomorrow, we're 100% behind that too.\" So it's a really cool balance of them being really supportive, but never pushing me too hard in one direction. All of this has changed their lives drastically. My mom goes on the road with me now, we don't see my brother and my dad as much because they stay back home in Tennessee, you know it's crazy to have people come and ring the doorbell every day. It's interesting because my brother is 17 and in high school so every time I'm on TV he hears about it in school, so part of me thinks about him every single time I make a decision or say something, I think about how it's going to affect my brother at school, so it's a really good gauge of my actions.\n\n2. Roz Lo asks: What's the weirdest thing you do when you get bored?\n\nThe weirdest thing I do when I'm bored... it seems like all I do is weird stuff when I'm bored. When I'm bored, omigosh my new favorite thing is going to Youtube and watching videos of these girls who teach you how to do makeup on Youtube, they do these videos of it and I'll like put in my search bar, Taylor Swift, \"Teardrops on my Guitar\" makeup tutorial, and there are like all these girls teaching you how to do the makeup for my videos. I watch it and I get like mesmerized. It's so relaxing watching other people do their makeup, I don't even know why. My cat is awesome - whenever I'm home I make sure that I spend time with my cat. Walking around the kitchen, finding things to eat, grazing. I like to make videos, like I love to edit videos together with music behind them. If I wasn't doing this I would be a music video editor.\n\n3. Lostxinxlove and Madisson from Florida both love how your make up looks--\"perfect\" and \"natural\"!  They ask:  what make up do you use and how do you go about applying it?  Gamesgirl94 also asks: What do you use for your hair in your videos and live performances?\n\nThe makeup that I use is all different, it all depends on what I have with me and how much time I want to spend on it. Usually I don't want to spend that much time on it. My basic thing that I do is MAC studio tech, NW20 I think is the color that my skin is right now. I use black gel liner, it comes in like a container like this with a brush, it's like foolproof, you can't mess it up, that's why I like it. I like to put like silver, light colors on the inside of my eye and like smoke it out toward the outside of my eye. MAC brushes are perfect for creases. I'm not a lip-gloss girl, my hair gets stuck in lip gloss 99% of the time that I have it on, so I kind of stopped wearing it. I'm more of a nude lip-liner kind of girl.\n\n4. Mango_girl, Macaroonsfortwo, and Shelby ask:  What is your favorite song on Fearless?\n\nMy favorite song on Fearless is, right now it's \"White Horse.\" It's a song I wrote about, in my mind the most heartbreaking moment of the breakup, and it's the moment you realize that the person you thought was gonna be in your future, and you thought was your Prince Charming and you thought that he was gonna be the One, and that all comes crashing down and you realize he's just a part of your past. I think that with a breakup that's the hardest part, and everything else is getting over it and recuperation. The song \"White Horse\" I can really relate to right now.\n\nMost Popular\nYellowjackets Sophie Nelisse & Jenna Burgess Agree Melissa Looks Like G-Flip\nCulture\nYellowjackets Sophie Nelisse & Jenna Burgess Agree Melissa Looks Like G-Flip\nBy Lex McMenamin\n145 Best Conversation Starters to Skip the Small Talk\nIdentity\n145 Best Conversation Starters to Skip the Small Talk\nBy Liv McConnell\nLady Gaga Teases Great Chemistry with Jenna Ortega in Wednesday Season 2\nCulture\nLady Gaga Teases Great Chemistry with Jenna Ortega in Wednesday Season 2\nBy Kaitlyn McNab\n5. Cameochristine asks: Where did you come up with the inspiration for \"Love Story\"?  (It's her favorite song!)\n\nThe inspiration for the song \"Love Story\" was when I was interested in a guy that wasn't a popular choice, and I got the idea for the song when I thought of the situation, and I thought, This is difficult but it's real, it matters--it's not simple or easy but it's real. And so I wrote the song around that, around one line in the second chorus and developed the entire song around it. Everything up till the ending is the actual story. And the \"Marry me Juliet, I love you\" is I think every girl's fantasy ending and the ending I hope I have someday.\n\n6. Oliviapark asks: Where's your favorite place to shop?\n\nMy favorite places to shop are Forever 21, I find the coolest things that you would never expect at Target and Wal-Mart, I love shopping there, and I love BCBG, love their dresses, they're so cute. The things you can find at Bebe sometimes are really awesome. And department stores are really cool because you can find all kinds of different brands, and they're all together and it's whatever's cute.\n\n7. Clara asks: Who is your celebrity crush?\n\nI think my celebrity crush right now is Chace Crawford. I really love Gossip Girl, and he's my favorite actor right now.\n\n8. Ara_a and Grace both ask:  Do you have any secret/hidden talents not musically related that we don't know about?\n\nAny hidden talents other than music? I'm really into grammar, like I need everything to be grammatically correct before I send it, like when I'm texting somebody or when I'm emailing somebody I have to make sure I have the right form of every word and that everything's spelled right. It's something I've been hung up on since I was little. So I guess... grammar?\n\n9. Doglover4 asks:  What inspired you to start singing and who is your biggest inspiration?\n\nI was inspired to start singing when I was really little. I've loved music all my life. There are videos that my parents have showed me when I was like four and would run up to people on the beach, like random strangers and just start singing for them, and they would never know where I was, they were always running after me trying to figure out who I was harassing at the moment. But I've always loved to sing for people, I've always loved music. My role models in country music are Shania Twain, Faith Hill, the Dixie Chicks. I think what they did for country music as female artists... they brought quirkiness, they brought comedy, they brought independence, and I really really love that.\n\n10. Christy from London asks:  What advice would you give to someone who wants to become a singer and get into the music industry?\n\nMy advice to someone who wants to become a singer and get into the music industry is that no one goes about \"making it\" in the same way, everybody does it differently. So don't be discouraged if you're not making it the \"right way\" or whatever. I think we have this idea in our head that we're going to be discovered, and that we're just going to be singing at like Eric's Bar and we're gonna be discovered by some A&R scout in the audience, some talent scout, and that's really not how it happens most of the time. Most of the time it takes moving to Nashville and meeting this person who knows this person who introduces you to that person who you play this song for and they like it and they tell someone about it ... it's this web. Usually if you ask a lot of people who made it music there wasn't one definitive moment that did it for them, it was working your way up step by step. And I think that's a way that works better. Don't be discouraged, have patience, be relentless, and never assume that you're entitled to success, because then if you get success it'll be a pleasant surprise.",

      "Transcript/Content": "CMT Insider Interview: Taylor Swift\n\nTeen Star Talks About Her Early Need to Move to Nashville\nNovember 26, 2008\nEditor's note: CMT Insider Special Edition: Taylor Swift debuts Thursday (Nov. 27) at 10:30 a.m. ET/PT.\n\nCMT Insider goes inside the world of country music's most popular teenager, Taylor Swift. Host Katie Cook takes a tour of Swift's tour bus, chats with the star about her sophomore album, Fearless, and learns about her transition into adulthood.\n\nIn this excerpt from Cook's interview, Swift talks about her need to create music -- and her need to leave her hometown in Pennsylvania to pursue a career in Nashville. The second part of the interview appears Friday (Nov. 28) at CMT.com.\n\nCMT Insider: Let's start at the beginning. What is your earliest memory of music?\n\nSwift: My grandmother was an opera singer, and so she was always singing, either around the house, or every single Sunday she'd get up and sing in front of the entire congregation at church. Also, Disney movies. I would come out of Disney movies singing the entire songs, and my parents were like, \"Didn't you just hear that once?\" So I think that was my first real comprehension of the fact that music was what I remember the most from a movie. Not exactly the plotline as much as the music.\n\nWhen did music really turn into an obsession for you?\n\nMusic was always subliminally the thing that drew my attention. I started to realize it when music became all I wanted to think about and all I wanted to do was sing. I was brought up with parents who went to college and had business degrees and worked in offices, so that's what I thought I was going to do when I was in third grade. They're like, \"So what are you going to do when you grow up?\" \"I'm going to be a stockbroker like my dad.\" I didn't know what a stockbroker was, but I knew that I wanted to be a stockbroker because that's what my dad did. It wasn't until a few years later that I realized maybe it would be possible to have a career in the thing that I loved, which was music.\n\nWhen did you first visit Nashville?\n\nI first visited Nashville after I watched this TV program about Faith Hill. It said that she went to Nashville and that's how she made it in country music. So ever since I saw that TV program when I was about 10, I was obsessively, obnoxiously bugging my parents every day -- \"We've got to go to Nashville. Can we go to Nashville? Can we go on a trip to Nashville like now? Or maybe spring break, can we go to Nashville?\" Everything led to that. It was like, \"So how was your day at school today, Taylor?\" \"Great. Can we go to Nashville?\" I would bug them every day about it until finally we planned a trip to Nashville. It was on spring break, and I was 11 and I had this little demo CD -- a karaoke CD of me singing songs by Dolly Parton and the Dixie Chicks and LeAnn Rimes. And I marched up and down Music Row with these demo CDs, and I'd walk in and hand them to the receptionist while my mom and my little brother were parked outside in a rental car.\n\nYou went in all by yourself?\n\nYeah.\n\nThat is so brave.\n\nThank you. I don't think I knew any better.\n\nWhat did you think was going to happen?\n\nI thought that they might be like, \"Oh, cool, you want a record deal? Here you go. Sign right there.\" I don't think I knew what was going to happen. I knew what would happen if I didn't try, and I knew I would end up staying in the same place and never knowing what would have happened if I had tried. What that trip resulted in was not me getting a record deal -- \"Here, sign on the dotted line. Let's make an album. You're 11.\" It was really more of me looking around this huge town and this huge place that is Nashville and realizing that there were hundreds of thousands of other people that wanted to do exactly what I wanted to do. I realized that there needed to be something about me that was different, and I needed to figure out something more than I had already figured out. I had figured out the whole performing and singing thing. I just realized I needed something else. So I went back to Pennsylvania and started writing songs and playing guitar.\n\nWhat were you hearing from people? Was it that you were too young? Was there something that came up over and over again?\n\nMost of the time, I only reached the receptionist level, and they were like, \"Oh sure, sweetie. I'll give this to them.\" Wastebasket. But they were very nice. But sometimes I would make it past. There's a woman who works now at my record label that met with me the first time I came to Nashville. When I would meet with people like that, I think they honestly saw that there was sort of a little bit of potential, but Nashville has been scared for a very long time of young people. When I was making the rounds first trying to get a record deal, the thing that I heard the most is: \"Country music does not have a young demographic. The country music demographic is 35-year-old females, and those are the only people that listen to country radio. So you, being a teenager, are not going to fit into country music because the only people that listen to country music and country radio are 35-year-old females.\"\n\nThat's what I heard everywhere I went, and I just kept thinking that can't be true. That can't be accurate because I listen to country music and I know there have to be other girls everywhere who listen to country music and want some music that is maybe directed more towards them, toward people our age. So I kept trying because I didn't believe that there was just one tiny demographic, that there was this one pinpoint you had to hit to be able to apply to country music. I thought that it could be broader than that.\n\nWhen did your family move to Nashville?\n\nAfter the trip that we initially took and met with people on Music Row, I went home and decided that I needed to learn a few more things before I went back. I learned guitar and I learned songwriting, and I never put it down. I would play guitar for four hours a day, and my mom would make me stop, and we'd have to tape up my fingers. So instead of playing at karaoke bars and things like that where I needed to drag my little karaoke machine everywhere, I would go with my guitar and I would plug it in at coffee houses, and I would bring my little amplifier and plug it in at Boy Scout meetings. I would plug it in at all these different places, little random places where you could play. I now had a portable instrument, and I could go accompany myself, and I could play anywhere I wanted to. That really expanded the places where I could play and my abilities. I played so much that I came a long way in a short period of time.\n\nWhen I was about 12, we started going to Nashville and taking trips every two months or so, going to Nashville for a week trying to meet songwriters, trying to get my foot in the door at different places. Eventually, we scored this meeting with RCA Records when I was 13. I went into RCA, and I pulled out my guitar and I played them a bunch of songs, maybe 20 songs. The A&R; people there said, \"We want to sign you to a development deal.\" And that was when I was 13. A development deal is not a full-on record deal. It's not \"All right, we're going to make an album. Let's go.\" It's \"We're going to sponsor and pay for your demos that you do over this next year, and we're going to see how you grow as an artist. And then in a year, we're going to decide whether we want you or whether we want to develop you for more time or whether we want to drop you.\" It's a non-committal commitment, but I was elated. I was just, \"Oh, my gosh! This huge record label wants to sign me to a development deal! I'm so excited!\" So we started coming to Nashville more and more and more, and eventually we just decided to move.\n\nDid that seem like a big sacrifice for your family at the time?\n\nLiving in Pennsylvania was great, and it was an incredible place to grow up, but I didn't have any friends, so I was like, \"Sure, let's move. I'll miss my friends even though I don't have any.\" So that wasn't a big deal for me. But my dad had to transfer his work to Nashville. For a while, he was commuting back and forth and it was an incredible sacrifice for my parents to make and I've never forgotten it.\n\n\nPART 2: She Talks About MySpace, Celebrity Blogs and Her Biggest Splurge\nNovember 28, 2008\n\nEditor's note: CMT Insider Special Edition: Taylor Swift airs Saturday (Nov. 29) at 1:30 p.m. ET/PT and Sunday (Nov. 30) at 11 a.m. ET/PT.\n\nCMT's Katie Cook recently enjoyed a lengthy conversation with country music's most successful teenager for the new 30-minute special, CMT Insider Special Edition: Taylor Swift.\n\nIn the excerpts selected for this second installment of a two-part interview, Swift talks about the power of the Internet, her adjustment to becoming a major celebrity and why she'd prefer some nice stationery to a house in the Bahamas at this point in her career.\n\nCMT Insider: Let's talk about the Internet because you really are the first country MySpace megastar. How did this come about? Was this your idea?\n\nSwift: The Internet. A lot of things in my career, people are analyzing in articles and going like, \"How did they structure this build or whatever?\" It was all accidents. Like MySpace. That was not a clever scheme. That was an accident. I made a MySpace [page] in eighth grade because all my friends had MySpaces, and that's how they talked to each other. So I wanted to be cool, too, and I wanted to make a MySpace. And I happened to play music, so I made a music MySpace. I started uploading my demos to my music MySpace, and all the sudden, I noticed that my friends were posting my music on their pages, and then their friends were hearing them on their pages and posting them on their pages. And all the sudden, I started to realize that I was getting friend requests from people I didn't know. So I was like, \"Hey, I'll accept everybody.\"\n\nAll of the sudden, I'm like, \"Wow, this is getting pretty big, isn't it?\" I didn't expect for MySpace to be a thing that propelled my career or was this huge army that it's become. It was just something that I made in eighth grade. And I wrote a bio, like a regular person bio. Not like an artist promotional bio, and that's how I've kept it. I comment people back as much as I can and I put up blogs every two seconds and I make video blogs. ... I like to basically let people in on what I'm doing. Video editing has been one of my favorite things lately because you can take what happens in your life, and if you put it to music, it becomes this cool story, this cool visual. I never like to use my songs in the background. I always like to use other people's songs because I feel like if I let people in on my musical tastes more, they'll know me more, and that's better, I guess.\n\nThe Internet has no doubt been a wonderful tool for you, but there is a dark side.\n\nYeah, some people are really mean. \"I hate her. She's ugly.\"\n\nHow do you deal with that?\n\nI just try to ignore the \"I hate her. She's ugly\" ones.\n\nDo you catch yourself at night going, \"I have to read just a little bit. I have to.\"\n\nYeah, exactly. I try to put my focus on the ones who are saying things on my MySpace because the MySpace comments are usually really nice. They're from people who are just loving and sweet and kind and have wonderful things to say. The ones that I try not to read as much are the comments below articles or message boards or anonymous comments below videos because when people can be anonymous, they're vicious and they're really mean. It's like sixth grade stuff like on crack. It's terrible. It's so mean.\n\nIt's like a big high school out there, isn't it?\n\nYeah, but meaner. Because in high school, you might have to own up to what you said in the hallway. If she hears what you said about her, it will get back to her, and she might come up to you and be like, \"Did you say that about me?\" In high school, you have to take ownership of it and own up to it, but on the Internet, it's very anonymous and you have every single opportunity in the world to bash anybody that you want to bash. The beautiful thing about music is that everybody has an opinion about it. The thing that makes me value the people that like me are the people that don't like me, because if everybody liked you, then maybe you wouldn't value the people that really had your back all the time as much.\n\nPeople get very obsessed with your every move when you're famous. They're like, \"I saw them doing this. I saw them doing that.\" How do you handle that?\n\nThere are certain ways that you can let this spotlight thing affect your life. You can either let it change your life, and you can spend all of your time living in fear of losing it and surround yourself with 40 bodyguards and try to cover up any personal connection between you and anybody else in the press. You can do that and you can really let it change your life, and you can live under a rock and hide from things. Or you can just live your life in spite of it, and that's what I do. I don't run from paparazzi or get in car chases trying to get away from them. I certainly don't call them, but I just try to live in spite of the things that have happened and have fun with it.\n\nWith dating, it's not that complicated. If two people get along great and there's chemistry, then why not date? We have the luxury of planes and getting on a tour bus to make that distance thing work. It really is up to whether the person that you're dating is the right person for you and is willing to make it work. Right now, I'm single, but it's not like I have this gloomy prediction for the future of dating, because I've learned that it can be done and it's not hard unless you make it hard.\n\nAnd just on the subject, anything you want to say about your recent dating?\n\nWell, recently it hasn't been that awesome, but it doesn't mean that in the future it won't be great. Right now, it's been a little bit of a rough time with that, but that doesn't mean that some day I'm not going to meet somebody wonderful who is right for me.\n\nGetting back to the Internet, do your family and friends get on there to defend you?\n\nI don't think so. My mom has been very tempted to before. She'll read some comment that's like, \"I heard that she ...\" and she goes, \"That's not true. I'm going to make a name. I'm going to be TexasCutie425, and I'm going to go on there and I'm going to tell them that that's not true -- because that's not true.\" I'm like, \"Mom, you can't do that because you will get addicted to that, because there's one rumor on there now. There's going to be 40 rumors on there by the end of the week. So just don't do that. Don't do that.\" We stay off of chat rooms and message boards and stuff like that.\n\nYou're making a lot of money now, and I'm wondering who helps you manage that. Do your parents help you figure out what to do with all the money?\n\nI was raised by a financial advisor for Merrill Lynch. My dad has been telling me all about my accounts and my finances since I was like 2. Before I could talk, he was talking to me about where my money was invested. So, honestly, I'm very careful about what I spend money on. I don't like to make extravagant expenses unless it's putting back into my career. I'll buy a great tour bus because I feel like that ensures that it's going back into my career. I need a great tour bus. I need to feel like I'm at home when I'm on the road. So the biggest thing I've bought is a tour bus.\n\nAs far as where my money is invested and my finances, I'm very up to date with that. I have monthly meetings with my business manager to talk about everything and all the contracts that are coming in and learning the legal side of things and learning the business side of things. It's been one of my favorite things about this. I love making music and I love producing music and creating this awesome album that people can open and enjoy. But there's also something very fascinating to me about the music business and about where the money is really made and the percentages and the point systems and things like that on records. It's something I've really taken an interest in lately.\n\nWhen you do splurge? What makes you really go out and blow some cash?\n\nWhen I do splurge, my weakness is two things. Little dresses are my weakness. Like Kelly, my friend, she's obsessed with shoes and she cannot walk by a cute pair of shoes and not buy them. She can't do it. I'm the same way with dresses. In a department store, we're doomed. But as far as another thing that I splurge on -- cards, like stationery and letters. There's this store called Papyrus, and they have these boxes of beautiful cards and I love them. And another thing that I'm obsessed with right now is old-fashioned wax seals. You light it and it drips the wax and you have a little stamp thing. I love writing cards and letters to people, and I have all these different colors of waxes so it goes differently with different colors of the envelopes, and you just stamp it and it's pretty.\n\nSo we're not sitting here talking about this house in the Bahamas. You're talking about stationery. You realize what an unusual celebrity you are. I'm just saying ...\n\nI love stationery.\n\nBut you can buy the store.\n\nI buy lots of stationery and I like really glittery. I like stationery a lot. I don't know. I don't need a house in the Bahamas right now. But I do need stationery.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Music, Etc.—Swift Rise to Stardom\nTaylor Swift created something of a sensation on the Nashville scene when she released her first single, “Tim McGraw,” at the age of 16, just two years ago. Her sophomore album, Fearless, which she co-produced with longtime collaborator, Nathan Chapman, sees her sharpening her writing skills even further and becoming increasingly confident in the studio.\n\nIf downloads of the advance single, “Fearless,” are any indication, Swift is about to enjoy yet another wave of even bigger success: Last month, the song was the number-one track on iTunes across all genres. Pro Sound News spoke to Swift about how she changed things up this time around—both in the studio and as a writer.\n\nOn Recording at Starstruck Studios:\n\nWe recorded this album primarily at Starstruck, which has an incredible feel to it—it makes you feel comfortable. When I’m comfortable, I give better direction to the band, and I certainly found that comfort level on this record. The vocal booth was on this balcony where you can see everything. Having Nick Buda (drummer) right below me where I could see what he was playing was great. Also, being able to look at the engineer and see him while he is talking is very important to me.\n\nOn Capturing Vocal Performances:\n\nI trust my co-producer, Nathan Chapman, with all the equipment choices. He’s worked with me since I was 14 and has such a good ear for what sounds good with my voice when it comes to microphones. We switch up the vocal mics from time to time, and it’s always different; we don’t have any preconceived formula. During some of the early tracking sessions, I would sing live vocals and we would often end up using those instead of having to go back and re-cut vocals.\n\nOn Working Out Instrumentation:\n\nI haven’t played much guitar on this record, because for me, it’s about the direction of what I want the other musicians to be doing—I really leave the guitar playing up to Nathan. I’ll typically play everyone a song that I wrote, and we start out with three musicians: Tim Marks on bass, Nathan on guitar, Nick Buda on drums and myself on vocals. We then track it in “garage band” style.\n\nOn Co-Producing with Nathan Chapman:\n\nIt’s really cool to be recognized as a co-producer on the album. When I write a song, I hear it completely produced in my head. I hear exactly what is going on in the track: the intro and the musical hook. For me, it’s all a matter of getting into the studio and accurately representing what’s in my head to the band, and working with Nathan to make sure it comes out exactly this way in the studio. Sometimes, I will hear a guitar solo and then sing it to the band. Or I will hear a bass line or even strings and sing it to them. I never learned how to read music—it felt like math to me. Music has always been much more feeling-based; I write music because that’s how I deal with my emotions.\n\nOn Keeping the Magic in a Vocal Track:\n\nI’ve worked with producers that have just drilled me into the ground until everything was just perfect—until they had 18 takes of each word. Nathan isn’t like that and lets the song unfold naturally. He believes in capturing the magic in a song and doesn’t make me sing any more than about three times. The majority of them are one-take songs—for example, my first single, “Tim McGraw,” was a one-take. Vocal fatigue never happens when I am tracking with Nathan.\n\nOn Evolving As a Writer:\n\nWhen I was writing the first record, I was a staff songwriter at a music publishing company. My job was to co-write—it’s what I was there to do, and I was supposed to write with as many people as possible. So the majority of my first album was co-written, and then there were three songs I wrote by myself. On my new album, I wrote eight songs by myself when I was on the road. I used to depend on a co-writer to edit the nuances and intricacies of a song, but once I went on the road and started touring, [I began to] have the arguments with myself and become my own editor. Something I’m really proud of is seeing my name as the writer down in the corner of the screen at the end of a video.\n\nOn Adding Last-Minute Songs:\n\nThe recording process on this album was spread out over the last year. We started recording last winter, and we did about three songs. About a month later, we did three more. Two weeks before the album had to be turned in and mastered, after all the other songs were finished, I wrote a new song and also decided that I wanted to put another song that we already recorded onto the album, making 13 tracks instead of 11. I went to the label and said, “Is there any way we could get an emergency recording session? I need to record this new song.” And [laughs] my record label president took a deep breath and said, “Yes, I guess you can do that.”\n\nI’ve always seemed to challenge myself really late in the game in the studio. On the last record, I did the same thing with a song called, “Should’ve Said No,” which I hadn’t even finished yet. But I had a gut feeling about the song, so at the end of a recording session, I asked Nathan if I could get the band to track it once, thinking I would write the rest later. That actually ended up being my second number-one song. On this album, I did “Forever and Always” and turned it into the mixer, who turned it into the mastering guy just hours before the entire project was due.\n\nOn Building Success a Step At a Time:\n\nI feel like the second album was a lot easier. Nathan and I never, ever want to slack off and say, “We’ve had success; this is going to be easy.” But knowing that we did have success with the first album gave us confidence that what we were doing was good. You always want to keep that quiet confidence without ever letting it go to your head, without feeling cocky and thinking that everything you touch is going to go platinum.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Men’s Fitness by Elizabeth Sanchez 11.08\n\n There aren’t many country music babes topping the pop charts or ruling MTV. Taylor Swift just joined that elite sorority. With the smash hit “Love Story,” the 18-year-old singer is the youngest person to write and sing a No. 1 country single. She’s won awards for her skills behind the mic and on the guitar, including the 2008 Academy of Country Music’s trophy for Top New Female Vocalist. With her new album, Fearless, in stores now, we asked Swift what excites her, what crazy fans do for her, and just how hard she’ll work those golden locks to get a guy’s attention.\n\nWhat’s the message behind the album’s first single, “Love Story”? \nIt’s a song about a love that isn’t simple. The basic thing that inspired this song is that love isn’t always easy—actually it’s almost never easy—but you know that it’s worth holding on to.\n\nWe heard one of your new songs, “White Horse,” was also chosen as a theme song for the new season of Grey’s Anatomy. Congratulations! \nThanks. I’ve never been so emotional in my life! That is my show!\n\nYou’ve said in the past that your love for Grey’s Anatomy has been your longest relationship to date. What would it take for a guy to break that record? \nHe’d have to be really funny and have to know how to laugh in tense situations. I also get stressed out sometimes, so somebody who can make me laugh in those situations is always really good. I also want to date someone who’ll eventually become my best friend. Someone who understands that I’m gone a lot and knows I’m not going to mess around if I’m on the road.\n\nWhat kinds of guys do you like to date? Do you like country guys? Jocks? Musicians?\nI really do not have a stereotype. I’ve dated all kinds of guys. Types aren’t what it’s about for me, it’s about the person. I think you can be attracted to a person for so many different things other than how they look or where they’re from or how they talk or what music they listen to. It’s about much more that that—it’s the X factor that attracts you to them.\n\nAs a famous musician, have you ever used your guitar or voice to get a guy’s attention?\nDefinitely. I had a crush on a guy in high school, and I wrote a song that mentioned every single thing I liked about him. I played that song at my high school talent show in front of him and all his friends. But it didn’t work. I didn’t hear from him. All I heard was that he went around bragging about it.\n\nWe know you’re a huge Tim McGraw fan. [Swift’s debut single was called “Tim McGraw.”] What’s the craziest thing a fan of yours has done to get your attention?\nThere are always those guys who scream, “Marry me!” during the shows, but I think the tattoos are the craziest. One guy came up and said that after I signed his arm, he got my signature tattooed on. Then there are guys that make shirts [referencing my songs] with things like, “You’ll never have to burn my picture.” Funny things like that make me really happy.\n\nTime for a little dishing: Girl-to-girl, what are your thoughts on Jessica Simpson’s going from pop to country?\nJessica Simpson? I like it when I see the words country music in the press. I don’t really care what the story is as long as it’s positive. If more artists want to come over to country music, that’s great. That’s good for country music. I want country music to have as much light shone on it as possible, so it’s always good to see country music in the press, regardless of what—or who—they’re talking about.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Our 2008 Interview With Taylor Swift, Teen Country Star\nRemind Staff\nFebruary 9, 2024\n\n“Who the hell is Taylor Swift?”\n\nThere was a time, 2008 to be exact, when “teen country star” Swift was not a pop-music megastar and destroying the NFL with her romances.\n\nDef Leppard singer Joe Elliott could be forgiven back then for not knowing who Swift was. “We’ve been trapped in our little cocoon, not listening to CMT or country music channels very often — not really sure who she was,” Elliott told our sister publication Channel Guide Magazine in an interview. “And then we learned — ‘What do you mean her first album sold 3 million copies already?’ It’s like, ‘Wow, you’ve got to be kidding me.’”\n\nSwift and Def Leppard joined together for an episode of CMT Crossroads later that year, and it was incredible.\n\nAlso incredible: Swift talked to Channel Guide Magazine for its November 2008 cover story. We like to think that we had something to do with her astronomical success.\n\nHey, Taylor, you’re welcome.\n\nRock Of Ages\nTeen Country Star Taylor Swift Meets Veteran Rockers Def Leppard At “Crossroads.” By Mike Frey\nTaylor Swift may have been born two years after Def Leppard released its best-selling album, 1987’s massively successful Hysteria, but don’t you dare question her fan credibility. She’s been listening to the band since birth — even earlier, in fact. Needless to say, the 18-year-old country star, whose self-titled debut has sold more than 3 million copies since its release in October 2006, is as excited as anyone that she’ll be sharing a stage with her hard-rock heroes during CMT Crossroads: Def Leppard and Taylor Swift, premiering Nov. 7 on CMT. We spoke with Swift, as well as Def Leppard vocalist Joe Elliott and guitarist Phil Collen about their upcoming collaboration.\n\nHow did this episode of “Crossroads” materialize? Was it really as simple as you saying in the press, “I want to do this thing with Def Leppard,” and then they called and said, “Let’s do it”?\nTaylor Swift: Oh, it was a little bit more interesting than that. I went on tour with Tim [McGraw] and Faith [Hill] last summer, and I found out through the grapevine that Tim and Faith’s tour manager was [Def Leppard drummer] Rick Allen’s brother. … So I started totally geeking out. … I walked up to Robert Allen, the tour manager, and said, “Is there any way that I could have your brother’s number?” And he said, “Um, no. But I could maybe arrange a phone call.”\n\nSo one day I was just sitting on my bus hanging out and Robert Allen brings his phone on the bus and says, “Here, I’ve got someone on the phone for you.” I get on the phone, and it’s this guy with a British accent named Rick Allen. I was like, “Hi, you don’t know who I am at all. You don’t know me or my music, probably, but I’m a new country artist, my name is Taylor and there’s this thing on CMT, which is Country Music Television, where they pair up rock acts with country acts and it’s a concert called Crossroads. My dream Crossroads partner is you guys, and I would really like it if you would do that with me — could you do that with me?” And he was probably thinking, “Who is this kid?” And I said, “So, do you think that you could think about that?” and he was like, “Well, uh, maybe I could ask the guys about it. Good talking to you.” So, I basically threw it out there that I really wanted to do a Crossroads with them, and then I didn’t hear anything for, like, six months. I was like, “Eh, yeah, that probably didn’t work. I probably freaked him out, like, in stalker mode.”\n\nI got a call from my record label like maybe six or seven months after that phone call, and they said, “Def Leppard just called. You’re on their radar, they know who you are, they’ve heard your music and they’re interested in the Crossroads.” And I was really excited about it.\n\nSince then, have you met the band in person?\nI have never met the band in person. My whole band has met their band — and they’re absolutely so in love with them it’s not even funny — but I had a previous obligation when they were in Nashville so I wasn’t able to go.\n\nSo what is it going to be like for you when you actually walk into a room with these guys for the first time?\nIt’s going to be amazing to walk in and see these people and meet them. I’ve listened to their music since I was a little kid. My mom listened to Def Leppard when she was pregnant with me. It’s pretty much ingrained into my genetics that I am to love Def Leppard, so it’s really cool to get to do this with them.\n\nHow do you prepare for something like this? I mean, it’s not just a normal show — you have to learn some of their songs, they have to learn your songs. How’s that going to work?\nWell, I think we’re going to pick five songs out of their enormous catalog of smash hits and pick five songs of mine, work them up and have the Def Leppard versions of my songs and, I guess, countrify some of their songs. It’ll be kind of fun.\n\nAre there any songs that you’re going to push for?\nI need to do “Pour Some Sugar on Me” and “Photograph.”\n\nWhat’s going to be more exciting — to hear them do one of your songs or to be able to do one of their songs with them?\nTo be able to play one of their songs with them is going to be awesome.\n\nDo you see some common ground between what you do and what they do?\nI think we both like to write songs about relationships and love and how people make other people feel. That’s why I’ve always been able to relate to their songs and maybe be influenced by their songs.\n\nYour music blurs the line between country and pop/rock. Where does that sound come from, and what other artists have influenced you?\nI was very influenced by Sheryl Crow and Shania Twain, and the things that they did with their music, where it was very relatable to everybody. That’s not my goal — I don’t sit down and say, “Let’s write a song that’s relatable to everybody, with a melody that could be played on both pop and country radio.” That’s not at all my thought process. My thought process is just, “Let’s write a song about what just happened yesterday with this guy.” When I sit down and write a song, I’m writing the song for the person that I’m writing the song about. I’m only thinking about what they’re going to hear when they hear the song. The fact that everybody else is going to hear it is just sort of an added bonus.\n\nYou’ve got a new album called “Fearless” coming out Nov. 11. What should you fans expect from this one?\nI like to write songs about boys and love and relationships, and that’s what I’ve got on this album just like I did on the first album. So it’s more of that, except with two more years of maturing, I guess. I don’t like to sit down and have a game plan for how an album’s going to turn out. I just like to put the best songs that I’ve written on an album, and put as many songs on it as I can possibly put it, and release as many songs as I can possibly release, and hope for the best. That’s what we did for the first album and hopefully we get similar results with the second album. I’m really excited about it. I coproduced this album, as well as wrote every song on it, so it’ll be really fun.\n\nAre there any songs in particular that you can’t wait for people to hear?\nThere’s a song called “You Belong With Me.” It’s about being in love with someone who doesn’t even know it, and they’ve got a really snobby, annoying, mean girlfriend who always brings them down. And, you’re like, “Come on, you belong with me. You should be with me, not her” — which was a really fun concept for me to sing about. Also, there’s a song called “15” that is probably the most personal song I’ve written, and a song called “Fearless,” which is about the best first date I’ve ever had.\n\nYou’re sort of in a unique position in that you’re still young but you’re already sort of a veteran in the music business. What have you learned over the past four of five years that has helped you get to where you are right now?\nThat life lessons count on a really grand scale when you’re in the music industry. It’s the things that you’re taught when you’re a little kid, like “Treat people the way that you would want to be treated.” You never know who you’re talking to. And that advice goes with the music industry or it goes with life. Treat people the way you want to be treated. … Also, be competitive but never be jealous.\n\nHave you had some negative experiences in the business?\nYou always play shows where you feel like you didn’t “bring it” to the stage or the sound was terrible or the crowd wasn’t really that fun. Or you have nights where you feel like nobody likes you and you have mornings where you just roll out of bed and you’re not a fun person to deal with for a couple of hours. Everybody does that. I think the most amazing thing about being in the music industry is that I kind of thought that all my heroes were like these superheroes that wore capes and were a little superhuman, but you realize that they all have bad days and they all have days where they’re really cranky and they don’t want to get out of bed. They just want to lay in bed and watch TV, and I think it’s really fun to allow yourself to have a few days like that, but the rest of the time be really thankful that you are where you are.\n\nJust to use Def Leppard as a frame of reference — they’ve been around for 30 years and they just debuted at No. 5 on the charts with their latest album. Do you want to be in this business 30 years from now?\nI would love to make music for the next 30 years. I don’t know if I want to be walking red carpets in 30 years. In 30 years, I’ll be 48 and I’ll have wrinkles — because we’re probably not going to get rid of wrinkles surgically — and I’m probably going to have some gray hairs. I think [one of] the people that I’ve seen gracefully do this [has] been Emmylou Harris — she’s so beautiful. I think people like that — I really aspire to be like them because I think she’s so very elegantly continued to make music. It’s not about fame for her, it’s about music.\n\nThere has been a lot of focus recently on who you may or may not be dating. Is it weird for you that people seem to care so much about your personal life or is that just something that comes with the job?\nI think I pay more attention when people write articles about my music. My personal life is something that people have been loving to write about lately. You know, I have a great life. I didn’t think I was going to get to do this. I didn’t think people were going to care who I go to dinner with and hang out with. The whole personal life thing, I look at it like I didn’t expect to be in this position and every day is a bonus day. I can take that with all the good stuff that I’ve been given. It’s not my favorite part, that people have a microscope on who I’m dating, but hey, whatever.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: Growing into superstardom\nBy George Hatza\nEntertainment editor\n\nThe headlines read like something one would see in an old Barbra Streisand movie, those newspapers spinning wildly toward the viewer when, to the world's surprise, a star is born:\n\n\"Swift's Sales Soar,\" screams Daily Variety. \"Taylor Swift, at 18, poised to be pop superstar,\" whoops the Associated Press. \"Prodigy!\" howls The New Yorker, for a moment forgetting its legendary austerity.\n\nUsurping half the lead page of the Sunday New York Times Arts & Leisure section, the world's most famous newspaper declares: \"My Music, MySpace, My Life: Taylor Swift expands country music's audience by stressing young love and personal connections.\"\n\nOh, and let's not forget Rolling Stone's four-star review for the 18-year-old Wyomissing native's sophomore album, \"Fearless\" (Big Machine Records), No. 1 on Billboard's country chart, with a handful of tunes in various locations on Billboard's top 10s.\n\nNot bad. Not bad at all.\n\nBoth of her albums (\"Taylor Swift\" and \"Fearless\") remain on the Billboard chart. Her MySpace page boasts nearly as many hits as McDonald's does hamburger sales. And forget about the downloads. Zillions.\n\nSo when Taylor spoke during a recent telephone interview, the once gawky teenager (and Abercrombie & Fitch model) was between rehearsals for the Grammy Awards nominations TV special, which she co-hosted Wednesday night with LL Cool J. Moreover, she was in the middle of getting her hair and makeup done.\n\n\"This will be interesting,\" she said with a laugh - actually, more like a giggle, referring to being fussed over while simultaneously talking seriously about her music.\n\nTaylor will turn 19 on Saturday, and already she's a superstar. The trophies are beginning to clutter whatever sort of mantel she has in the Hendersonville, Tenn., home she shares with her father, Scott; her mother, Andrea; and her younger brother, Austin.\n\nSo how did this all begin, this explosive rise to fame and fortune? How does an 18 - well, almost 19-year-old - handle that kind of attention without turning into Britney Spears or Lindsay Lohan?\n\n\"The words,\" Taylor said. \"I love words. I love to write. Being an artist is what I love.\"\n\nIf Taylor - passionate and savvy - is anything, she's grounded. The \"words\" to which she refers are more than just lyrics to bouncy country melodies. They have deep, emotional meaning for her. They emanate from the chill of rejection and romantic loss and the pain of being thought strange when she was a middle-schooler in Wyomissing.\n\n\"I didn't have friends,\" she said. \"No one talked to me. I used to go to the Wyndcroft School (nationally recognized for academic excellence) in Pottstown, and when I moved to Wyomissing, I didn't know anybody.\"\n\nBut she got through the day knowing that when she went home, she would turn to her diary, write poems and songs. She would work through the pain. And she still is, if you take the time to listen closely to her songs, to the words, in \"Our Love,\" \"Teardrops on My Guitar,\" \"Tell Me Why\" and \"Fifteen,\" to name a few.\n\nAs a young child, she said she would leave a Disney movie, and rather than talk about what she saw she would sing all the songs, nailing all the words. Music was then, and still is, the love of her life.\n\nHer grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, was an opera singer, so she comes by her talent honestly.\n\n\"I can remember her singing, the thrill of it,\" she said. \"She was one of my first inspirations.\"\n\nOthers include teachers at Wyndcroft and country performers Patsy Cline, LeAnn Rimes, Shania Twain and the Dixie Chicks.\n\n\"When I was 9 or 10, I used to get all the lead roles because I was the tallest person,\" she said. \"But my interest in music soon drew me to country music. I was infatuated with the sound, with the storytelling. I could relate to it. I can't really tell you why. With me, it was just instinctual.\"\n\nFrom her earliest memories, she recalls thinking in musical terms, in rhyme and melody. Her interest in poetry honed her skills with language. And soon, the two merged into song: words married to music about the real world, at least Taylor's world.\n\nIt was what she claims informed her music when she attended Wyomissing.\n\n\"The people around me provided all the inspiration I needed,\" she said. \"Everything I wrote (at that time) came from that experience, what I observed happening around me.\"\n\nTo this day, that remains true. It is, experts agree, what sets her apart from her peers. Her music emanates from what she feels. Today, it's boys and, uh, boys. Also it's family and, oh yes, boys. However what will it be in 20 years?\n\nYoung girls are her biggest fans. They understand her music, what she's saying about youth and romance. These kids also have technical skills. They know MySpace and Facebook and YouTube and all the other networking places where 'tweens and teens trade horror stories about the opposite sex.\n\nWhat comes later?\n\nPerhaps acting?\n\n\"I've had offers for roles on sitcoms,\" she said. \"But it has to be the right one. So far, nothing has been. But I do enjoy acting on my videos.\"\n\nWhen Taylor manages some all-too-rare down time, she spends it with her friend Abigail, who emerges as a character in the song \"Fifteen.\" The pair dis boys and bake and drive around Nashville talking about, you guessed it, boys.\n\n\"Actually, most of all I enjoy editing my videos for MySpace,\" she confided. \"It actually relaxes me.\"\n\nHer connection to Pennsylvania has diminished, she admitted. There is no family here. Her father, a stockbroker, still has clients who live in the area. And her closest friend when she was growing up, Britany Maack, still has roots here. They keep in touch while Britany's at college.\n\n\"Hendersonville is home because I live there and I work there,\" she said. \"But when I come back to Pennsylvania and see the crowds and the landscape, it's such a rush. It just feels like home.\"\n\nThese days, however, Taylor is hanging out with Kellie Pickler, the country singer and former \"American Idol\" contestant, whom Taylor clearly adores.\n\n\"She's like a sister,\" she said. \"People say we're such opposites, but that's what makes us such good friends. She's incredibly blunt. I love that about her. If some guy has said or done something to me she doesn't like, she'll grab my cell phone and say, 'I'm deleting his number.'\"\n\nAs critics debate whether Taylor's music is pop or country, the issue already has been decided by the singer/songwriter.\n\n\"I write songs the way I hear them in my head,\" Taylor said. \"Call it what you want, but country is where I'm proud to be. Sure, the crossover success is wonderful.\"\n\nIndeed it is. It has helped to sell more CDs and downloads, expanded her fan base and put her on the cover of every major magazine in the country. The level of her success even has shocked her.\n\n\"What surprised me over the past year is that I thought I'd already made it,\" she said. \"That I was in an amazing place where I would be thrilled to stay. I thought, 'I don't need to be any bigger than this to be happy.' But then it just blew up! I'd be lying if I said I had this all planned. I honestly don't know how it happened. It's such a blessing.\"\n\nWhen asked what she would choose if she could change anything about her life at this moment, she responded following a long silence: \"Look, even the things I would change (she remains markedly unspecific), well, there's probably a reason for my going through it. I have to trust that. Otherwise, that's just added stress.\"\n\nShe has taken a few knocks from some critics about her singing voice - that it can be thin and unexpressive in a live performance. Yet others have found it sweetly understated, working in ironic counterpoint to her shrewd, often biting lyrics.\n\nSo does she think of herself more as a singer or a songwriter? She doesn't hesitate.\n\n\"I love lyrics more than notes,\" she admitted. \"A song is a favorite song not because the singer can hit and hold a high note but because of the words, their meaning. Sure, you have to incorporate a great melody. But I'm proud of those lyrics. And I'm lucky that I have a label that lets me sing and write all the songs on my records. Don't get me wrong; I'm thankful I get to be a singer.\"\n\nSo backing up to an earlier question: What comes later? If she's writing about boys and, uh, boys today, what will she be writing about in the future if her career is to have longevity?\n\n\"I write songs about my life,\" she said with Pickler-esque bluntness. \"When my life changes, so will my music. It's as simple as that. I tell stories.\"\n\n• Contact George Hatza at 610-371-5075 or ghatza@readingeagle.com.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Vanity Fair: Platinum Blonde\n\nThe Tennessee teenager who is putting pop-country first.\n\nby Ned Zeman\n\nWhen a regular person writes and records a love song referring to a celebrity, it’s a little creepy. But when someone like Taylor Swift does it—as she did with her 2006 hit single, “Tim McGraw”—it’s a golden ticket.\n\n\n It helps, probably, that Swift is hot and blonde, but not aggressively so. Country fans don’t go for all that sassy-trampy nonsense. Just as crucially, Swift isn’t too country. She’s a twang-pop hybrid: Faith Hill with a guitar and writing credits. Which makes sense, since Hill is married to McGraw, whom Swift met only after her song came out.\n\nSwift is a teenager. Have we mentioned that? She wears leather in Maxim but remains the home-schooled songbird who still lives with her parents, in Hendersonville, Tennessee. This also helps, popularity-wise. Swift’s self-titled debut album, released in 2006, has spent 24 weeks atop Billboard’s Top Country Albums chart. Now comes her second album, Fearless, whose first single, “Love Story,” is already a Top Five hit. Ah, they grow up so fast.\n\n“When I made my first album, I was 16,” Swift says. “Now I’m 18. You can’t help but grow in those two years. It wasn’t anything I was trying to do. It’s just one of those things you can’t help but happen. I like to write songs about boys, and I love to write songs about relationships. And that hasn’t changed.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Introducing: Taylor Swift\n\n12.09.08\n\nWhat was all that about record sales declining, music becoming a solitary pastime and no one having proper big hits anymore? Somebody must have forgotten to tell Taylor Swift.\n\nAmerica’s most spectacular new star of the past two years has united millions of admirers and bridged the gaps between musical genres, becoming a multi-platinum teenage sensation in the process. Now, she’s getting ready to build another bridge: across the Atlantic, as she unveils her first international album release FEARLESS on Universal Music.\n\n\nThe album will provide an irresistible introduction for Taylor’s already expanding global audience, including her massive hits as ‘Our Song,’ ‘Teardrops On My Guitar’ and ‘Should’ve Said No’, as well as the latest smash ‘Love Story.’ That song powered into the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 in just two weeks, with downloads well on their way to US Platinum Single status (more than 1 million tracks sold).\n\nTaylor’s debut outside her own shores was previewed to brilliant effect (“brilliant” is one of her favourite English expressions, you see) with a show-stoppingly glamorous, high-octane show in London in early September 2008. To say that she got the crowd on her side would be a spectacular understatement. Now, with the release of FEARLESS, accompanied by her fizzing personality and charm, the whole world is about to be on her side.\n\n“It’s really cool to come over to Europe and have a fresh start and introduce myself for the first time,” she says. “I’m really excited about it. And I hope that my music knows no boundaries, borderlines or genres.”\n\nTaylor Swift can speak for herself with such eloquence that when you meet her, you soon forget that when she was born, the 1990s were less than three weeks away. But her achievements speak for themselves too.\n\nThis is the talent that gate-crashed the American charts in 2006, before Taylor was yet 17, and delivered no fewer than five hits, every one of which hit #1 iTunes in the US and two going #1 on Billboard, from an album that turned the business upside down by going triple platinum. That was an almost unheard of feat for an artist so young, but for Swift to achieve it with a quintet of heavyweight hit singles that she wrote or co-wrote herself, then to sell over three million copies of an album she had creative control over, was truly unique.\n\nBack when Taylor was looking for the right label partner, she played a showcase, just her and her guitar, at Nashville’s famous Bluebird Café. Sure enough, suitors came calling, but she had the precocious determination to hold out for a deal that gave her the input she wanted. “As I started talking to the labels, I figured out they weren’t going to be into me writing the whole record,” she says. “That was a major setback for me.”\n\nEnter Scott Borchetta, who told Swift about his plans for the new, independent Nashville label that became Big Machine. “He said ‘I have this dream of starting a label and I would like you to be my first artist.’ There was something about the way he said it that made me think he would let me do it my way. He ended up creating that label and I was one of the first artists signed to it, and it’s worked out really well.” You see, she can do understatement too.\n\nFast forwarding to the amazing reception to Taylor’s songs in the US over the past two years, it has a whole lot to do with how real and believable her lyrics are. Compositions like ‘Our Song’ and ‘Should’ve Said No’ were songs everyone could believe in – and they did believe in them, all the way to No.1.\n\n“My early songs were based solely on what I was going through,” recalls Taylor. “I wrote them so fast, I didn’t think about being inspired by other people or sounds. For me it was just how quickly can I write this down right now.”\n\nShe’s toured those songs to massive impact all across the States playing to well over a million and over 200 shows and now, as she turns 19, Taylor’s new songs boast even greater maturity. It’s evident whether it’s on the upbeat, instant smash ‘Love Story’ (“a song I kind of based around Romeo & Juliet, but it’s more of a modern-day twist on it”), the reflective ‘Fifteen’ or the wise-beyond-her-years ‘White Horse’, recently featured in the series premiere of her favourite TV show, ‘Grey’s Anatomy.’\n\nAs if all that wasn’t enough, Taylor is also making swift inroads onto the big screen, having made cameo appearances in the ‘Hannah Montana’ movie scheduled for 2009, and in a planned 3D film project by the Jonas Brothers.\n\nTaylor Swift’s life is all about enjoying the incredible things happening to her, but keeping them all in perspective. She may soon be flying around the world too much to keep her feet physically on the ground, but metaphorically she’ll be doing just that, all the while savouring the fact that her day job includes the thing she loves the most. “Music has to be in my day. There’s nothing without music. It gives people a way to say how they feel. Sometimes we have no idea what we’re feeling unless somebody says it perfectly for us, and when that moment happens, it becomes your favourite song. That’s a really special thing, and it’s an honour to make music that could possibly be somebody’s favourite song.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "American Songwriter: Elevating Teen Dreams Into Art\n\n12.12.08 By Edd Hurt\n\nTaylor Swift isn’t precocious, cute or sweet, although she possesses a winning combination of vulnerability and toughness, which is one key to her immense success. The 18-year-old singer, songwriter and budding mogul doesn’t exactly sing country, either. She might have penned what sounds initially like a paean to Tim McGraw, but 2006’s hit single “Tim McGraw” turns out to be about her own experience, with McGraw’s music as the backdrop to a life that runs like an accelerated, time-lapse film of growth-where there was bare ground two seconds ago now teems with bright colors. Like most current music marketed to a country audience, Swift’s 2006 self-titled debut was something else entirely. She is, in many ways, a classic singer/songwriter, the kind of artist who is driven to pick apart the quotidian.\n\n\n\nStill, her autobiographical impulses and her devotion to the everyday put her in line with any number of young country and Americana artists, even if Taylor Swift sounds slick enough for her to have snagged an opening slot on a recent Rascal Flatts tour. Still, Swift’s teen-pop goes deep and gets ambivalent while hewing to the conventions of the well-made Nashville song. After all, what mainstream country or pop artist recording in Nashville has the luxury of experimenting?\n\nOn her new album, Fearless, Swift doesn’t break a lot of new ground musically, but her knack for conversational and slightly troubled lyrics remains intact. Like the best writers, she finds a way to open up her narratives, which makes her-deservedly-a poet of the teenage experience. In her best songs, however, she’s something more. Fearless’s title track takes time to note the “glow off the pavement” as she makes her way through another closely observed romantic dilemma. And part of Swift’s poetry is the way she offers the image and then snaps it shut with the following line, “you walk me to the car.” Swift seems to understand how a narrative song uses imagery to give us a glimpse into her state of mind, and to show how sharply she notices the world. A less commercial or skillful writer might have offered another image, but Swift phrases the line “you walk me to the car” in a very canny way. The image flows seamlessly into the action. She closes the book on that particular bit of emotion and advances her tale like the storyteller she is.\n\nFor all that, Swift operates like an artist, right down to her obsession with writing. Discovered by future Big Machine Records executive Scott Borchetta at Nashville’s famed songwriting temple the Bluebird Cafe singing a song she’d written when she was 14, Swift-born in 1989 and raised on a Christmas-tree farm in Wyomissing, Penn.-had already been writing at a furious clip. “The song, ‘Picture to Burn,’ which was a Top 5 single for us, I wrote that when I was 14 and played it at that [Bluebird Cafe] showcase,” Swift says.\n\nMost writers are born as well as made, and Swift proves it. “For me, I started out writing when I was 12. I learned three chords on a guitar and wrote my first song that night,” she remembers. “I would write songs until my fingers bled, until my mother would make me leave my little computer room and come to dinner. I found something at that point that I absolutely couldn’t put down.”\n\nMoving with her family to Nashville, Swift quickly achieved the near-impossible: she landed a publishing deal with Sony/ATV. As she says, “I was the youngest person Sony had ever signed. And I walked into writers’ session with writers that I knew were hit songwriters. I knew they were twice if not three times my age, and I knew they were going to have serious doubts about walking in and working with a 13-year-old. The first writers’ sessions I got were due to my publisher pulling major favors.”\n\nThat might be true, but setting up younger writers with more experienced tunesmiths is a venerable Nashville tradition, and also, of course, a way of hedging one’s bets. Swift might have been young, but she was determined to make the most of an opportunity most aspiring writers would envy.\n\n“I knew I couldn’t let my publishers down, and I couldn’t let this industry down,” Swift says of those early writing sessions. “And I knew how people were going around talking about how there’s this 14-year-old who had just lucked into a major publishing deal. So, before every single writing session, I’d walk in with 15 or 20 ideas, of songs that were almost finished. For me, I just wanted everyone to know I was serious about it, and that, yes, I was going to high school during the day. But while I was in school, every second of my free time was spent on thinking of ideas to bring to these co-writers.”\n\nOn Taylor Swift, she wrote most of the songs with Liz Rose. “She’s one of my favorite co-writers,” Swift says, “and she and I wrote eight of the songs on my first record, and I think three of the songs on my second record are ones I wrote with her. I felt so comfortable with her that sometimes I would bring in the craziest ideas. Sometimes they worked, sometimes they didn’t. A case in point where it worked was when I brought in an idea called ‘Tim McGraw.’ She looked at me like I was crazy, and then, as I kept on playing this idea for her, it sunk in. She got it.”\n\nThe result has since become famous-a real landmark of teen-pop and country crossover that doesn’t sound in the least bit country. (On both her records, the pedal steel and banjo are merely signifiers. Musically, she operates strictly in mainstream pop, with a haze of indie indecision hanging over some of her chord changes.) Like many of the songs on Fearless, Taylor Swift’s “Picture to Burn” has formal affinities with the work of Pavement or any number of ‘90s indie-rockers. It’s a generational thing, and one gets the sense that Swift’s music-and the rather anonymous backing of the studio pros she uses-is secondary. Swift, however, doesn’t see it that way.\n\n“It’s like a puzzle,” she says of her efforts to marry music and lyrics. “If you get the code and the syncopation and the melody and the emotion just right, the words can absolutely bounce off the page. I love syncopation-the way you can take a chord structure and play it and lay a bunch of different melodies and lyrics on top of it. It’s almost conversational. I like to write conversational songs because I can relate to them more.”\n\nWriting with Big and Rich’s John Rich for the new record, Swift turned out “That’s The Way I Loved You.” Here, the composition integrates music and lyrics in a completely natural and intelligent way. Unlike some of Swift’s songs, which can sound like lyrics simply grafted onto a melody, “That’s The Way I Loved You” binds together sound and sense. The experience of hanging out with Rich was something of an eye-opener for the young singer. “I went to write with him, and he’s like a cartoon character,” Swift laughs. “I say that in the best way possible. I went to meet him at a gas station near his house and he pulls up in this Bentley, this crazy-expensive car. He pulls up, rolls the window down-the window’s completely blacked out–and I’m just, like, of course, John Rich drives that. He’s got this bulldog named Frank Sinatra. Writing with him was so amazing, because I didn’t know how it was gonna click.”\n\n“That’s The Way I Loved You,” about the conflict of choosing between a perfect, amiable guy and the bad boy she still dreams about, contrasts slightly mechanical-sounding verses with a more relaxed chorus (she sings the verses as if she’s slightly distracted, with an intentionally unnatural emphasis on certain words). Swift says that was intentional. “We wanted the verses to seem very robotic,” she explains. “But then when you get to the chorus, the melody explodes. We wanted to reflect the lyrics of the song in the way the melody was.”\n\nSwift talks about what she calls “a crazy, weird minor chord [Rich] came up with,” and this reveals an aspect of her experience that seems strangely unformed. The chord, and its place in the song’s harmonic progression, is pretty standard; The Beatles used it in “You Won’t See Me” in 1965. Despite her undeniable talent, it’s hard to shake the feeling that Swift is writing to formula a lot of the time, and that the formula excludes a lot of ideas that could be interesting, not to mention commercial. There’s nothing particularly surprising about her choice of chord progression and rhythms, although this may be a byproduct of the Nashville practice of co-writing.\n\nFearless does well with its readymade forms, however. In her hands, the standard pop song-already assembled and ready to use-becomes a vehicle for expressing her emotions. The casual “Hey Stephen” might be the best track on the record. With its nod to Phil Spector’s girl-group productions in its drum intro, “Hey Stephen” stands as a first-rate pop song. Throughout Fearless, one marvels at Swift’s precision as a writer of lyrics. When she sings the line, “repeating history and you’ve gotten sick of it,” it’s clear she is some kind of newfangled master of the colloquial.\n\nSwift is a pro, and she’s still incredibly young. When she talks about becoming a mogul in the mold of Madonna or Dolly Parton, it’s not hard to imagine. She’s a realist who one day may find a way to overcome Music City’s formulas. The pressure must be incredible, and she seems to take Nashville’s peculiar, hot-house style of writing in perfect stride. “What you can learn from a co-write session is that it can be the best thing, if the ideas are flowing,” she says. “If it’s not right-well, there are days when it’s not gonna work.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "The Boot: Taylor Swift Talks Friends, Fears and Fairy Tales\nBy Melissa Newman\n\n12.19.08\n\nBy any measure, it’s good to be Taylor Swift. The 19-year-old has gone from wannabe singer to country superstar in less than three years. Her meteoric rise is accompanied by the kind of critical huzzahs from such august outlets as the New Yorker and the New York Times that many older artists would give their right arm for.\n\nHer second full-length album, ‘Fearless,’ entered the charts at No. 1 and has bounced back up to the top toward year’s end. During our exclusive interview after her AOL Music Sessions taping, despite being tightly booked for back-to-back interviews, Swift is relaxed, convivial and focused as she answers questions about her life in and out of the studio.\n\n\nWhy did you call the album ‘Fearless’?\n\nI really wanted to make sure it was the right choice, so I took that word “fearless” and I applied [it] to each one of the things that my songs deal with: getting your heart broken, having to face the fact that you’re not going to be with the person you thought you were going to be with, someone apologizing to you over and over again for something they’re never going to stop doing, having faith that maybe someday things will change ? all of those things I thought had a fearless element to them. Also, I think that the word “fearless” doesn’t necessarily mean that you don’t have any fears. I think that sometimes being fearless is having fears but jumping anyway.\n\nPart of the charm of ‘Love Story’ is the “just say yes” refrain. When was the last time that you just said yes to trying something new?\n\nI bought red lipstick the other day. I’m the kind of person who’s really modest with lipstick or any kind of color at all, and I think people are going to throw something at me if I wore red lipstick! But my best friend and I were in the makeup store, and I just looked down and saw the red lipstick and said, ‘I need a change. I’m doing it!’ I bought it and wore it out of the store, and I felt like I was making this daring change.\n\n‘White Horse’ is the current single mainly based on its huge sales on iTunes. Why you think people are responding to that song so strongly?\n\nOn this album, I deal with a lot of fairy tale themes. Sometimes they turn out good, sometimes they turn out bad. ‘Love Story’ was a really happy ending — you put everything you have into love and it works out. Then in the song ‘White Horse,’ you put everything you have into love and you get your heart broken. It blew my mind that such a personal song was the one people were talking the most about, because I always felt like the more personal my songs were, the more I could just relate to them. But, really, more people have been able to relate to those songs — the ones that I wrote when I was really going through something terrible.\n\nWhen you were growing up, what was your favorite fairy tale?\n\nThe one I loved the music to the most was ‘The Lion King.’ There are about 4,000 videos of me as a little kid singing ‘Lion King’ songs. Like, running up to random strangers on the beach and just breaking out in song!\n\nDo you want to do Broadway?\n\nI think Broadway is something that I might want to do when I’m older. I started out in children’s theater, and I have just this complete appreciation for drama. In my headlining tour this year, it’s my goal is to make it dramatic and to make a theatrical element to it, rather than just song after song after song.\n\nThe song ‘Change’ is a bit of a departure for you in that it takes a strong stance to challenge the status quo. What inspired that?\n\nI wrote the song ‘Change’ as an underdog story. It’s kind of crazy to think that the Olympics chose this as one of the songs to play during the Olympic Games. That blew my mind, because what I actually wrote this song about was being on a small record label. When you’re at a record label that had 12 employees, you have to work harder to get on major tours. You have to work harder to get presenter slots or performer slots on award shows. There was this moment where I sat there and was like, ‘When are we going to get a fighting chance? We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’ I wrote the beginning to this song, and I thought someday things are going to be different. I finished the song the night that I won the Horizon Award at the CMA Awards and looked over and saw the president of my tiny, little record label crying.\n\nYou talk about how this album has a lot of love songs on it. To me, the most beautiful love song is ‘The Best Day.’ Talk about the day you played that for your mom.\n\nI started writing it in the summertime last year, and I decided I wasn’t going to play it for my mom until Christmas. So I finished the song secretly [and] recorded it completely without her knowing. I synched it up with all these home videos of me when I was little with her, and I made this music video for it. On Christmas Eve, I put it in the DVD player and played it for her. She didn’t know that it was me singing until about halfway through the song, at which point she burst out crying. It’s probably one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever written. My mom and I have been best friends since I was born. So I’m really glad that I got that down on CD.\n\nYou never went through a rebellious stage with your mom like a lot of teenage girls do?\n\nMy mom has never been condescending. She’s not the kind of person that needs to be perfect all the time and needs me to see no flaws in her. The coolest thing about my mom is she’s always been so real with me, and honest no matter what. When I was little, she would indulge my imagination and tell me stories. I attribute my fascination with writing and storytelling to that. And even when I was preteen, that’s when I needed her the most. That’s usually when people are [at the] too-cool-for-their-parents stage. Well, I was really not cool enough for anyone but my parents in that phase. I had no friends! My mom was the one person that I could turn to and who never, ever, hurt me.\n\nWhat’s the strangest thing that a fan has ever given you?\n\nThis guy gave me a big turtle shell with my face painted on it — that was definitely a first! Then it’s always awesome when someone walks up and they’re like, ‘I got a gift for you — got that done last week,’ and it’s my name tattooed on his arm. It’s such an honor to be tattooed on someone’s body, because that’s permanent! I just want to walk up to him and be like, ‘I really hope that this whole career thing works out for me so that two years from now you’re not really embarrassed of that.’\n\nWho would we be surprised to know is on your iPod?\n\nI’m a big Lil Wayne fan — I love him, Kid Rock, Jesse McCartney — it’s like a complete Jesse McCartney phase, all of his albums. I have this giant Jesse McCartney playlist right now. So that’s probably my big shocking music fascination right now.\n\nWhat do you do when one of your songs comes on the radio?\n\nI’ll listen to it, but I want to check the other radio stations to make sure that one of the songs I really love isn’t on. If there’s a song that I’m a big fan of, I’ll change it to that. But if nothing else is on, I’ll turn it up and be like, ‘Yes!’ I still have that moment. That never gets old when your song is on the radio.\n\nYou’ve recently said that any guy you date now is starting to realize that they’re probably going to end up in a song. What else should any guy you date know before going into the relationship?\n\nI’m not typically the girl that dates a lot of guys or is in relationships a lot. Most of my life I’ve been single. If I meet somebody who’s great, I’ll make an exception, but I’m really happy being alone. I’m happy being single. I don’t feel a sense of emptiness if I don’t have a boyfriend. I think that that’s an important thing to carry into a relationship, because if you need the other person — if you’re like, ‘I need to talk to you! Why didn’t you call me back?’ — if you’re that girl, then nobody’s going to want to date you. So I think that it’s important that whoever I date be an independent person, because I’m a really independent person. I have this rule: I don’t call a guy first. You can’t ever send two text messages in a row. If they don’t answer your text messages, then that’s fine. Don’t stress it out and send another text message. I think that it’s important to be confident in who you are, because the best thing you can bring to a relationship is a whole person.",

      "Transcript/Content": "She Ain’t Movin’: Taylor Swift Still the Tops in Country and Pop\n\nDecember 20, 2008; Written by Edward Morris\nIf your Christmas wish was that this column would finally stop effusing about Taylor Swift, prepare to grit your teeth. Her blonde perkiness still prevails — and without mussing her hair — as 2008 slides into the dustbin of publicity statistics.\n\n\nThus let it be noted that Swift’s Fearless not only crowns Billboard’s country albums chart this week for the fifth consecutive time but also rockets back to the top of the magazine’s all-genre listing, elbowing aside Britney Spears’ Circus in the nicest possible way.\n\nFor the second week, Montgomery Gentry’s “Roll With Me” holds the No. 1 spot on the songs chart.\n\nNo new country albums surface this week although a couple return: Tim McGraw’s Limited Edition: Greatest Hits: Volumes 1, 2 & 3 (at No. 61) and Bill & Gloria Gaither with Homecoming Friends’ Bill Gaither Presents: Country Bluegrass Homecoming, Volume One (No. 73). Obviously, the department of snappy titles was out to lunch when these two verbal mutants were minted.\n\nFour new songs make their bow: Carrie Underwood’s “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing” (No. 54), Josh Gracin’s “Telluride” (No. 58), Faith Hill’s “Little Drummer Boy” (No. 59) and Steve Holy’s “Might Have Been” (No. 60).\n\nThe remaining Top 5 albums, in descending sequence, are Hill’s Joy to the World, Elvis Presley’s Christmas Duets, Rascal Flatts’ Greatest Hits, Volume 1 and Taylor Swift.\n\nNipping at Montgomery Gentry’s heels in the Top 5 songs are Rascal Flatts’ “Here,” the Zac Brown Band’s “Chicken Fried,” Sugarland’s “Already Gone” and Brad Paisley and Keith Urban’s “Start a Band.”\n\nThe rest is silence.",

I’m in the process of designing a line of sundresses for L.E.I., so be sold exclusively as Wal-Mart.Dresses are what I wear most, so I’m really excited for them to come out!”\n\nOn one of her fave celebs: I was always so nervous to meet her and when I finally did at the ACM’s in 2007, she was the sweetest celebrity I’d ever met. She andTim McGraw took me out on tour with them as their opening act that summer, and Faith would always leave presents in my dressing room.\n\nOn the benefits of post-high school education: “I’ve always thought that college makes you a well-rounded person. It’s about the experiences you gather and the life lessons you learn, and it teaches you how to be independent. If I were to take classes later on in life, it would probably have something to do with video editing. I’m really fascinated by all of that.”\n\nOn her new album, Fearless: “I think being fearless means that you’ve got a lot of fears, but you jump anyway. I have a new favorite [song] every day. Right now, my favorites on the album are ‘You’re Not Sorry’ and ‘White Horse.’”\n\nhttp://justjaredjr.buzznet.com/2008/12/21/taylor-swift-faith-hill/\n\nScans are available at another great fansite, TaylorSwiftSource.com\n\nSHARE THIS:",

And if you fall in love with it before it becomes a hit, you take ownership of it. That's what happened to me with One of the Boys. Katy Perry has so much charisma, as soon as I heard \"Hot N Cold,\" I fell in love. I said, \"This is gonna be big.\" And it was.\n\nMY FAVORITE SONG\n\n\"If I Were a Boy\" by Beyoncé\t\nIt makes you think. It's not a song you fully understand the first time you listen, and it makes you want to listen again. The video blew my mind. It starts out showing this girl who's career-oriented and living with this guy who caters to her every need, and she's going out and flirting with all these other guys. You feel so bad for that guy. Then it switches halfway through the song — you realize she's the one who's committed to him, and he's out there playing the field. And it makes you mad! I really identify with [the song]. It says how I feel better than I ever could.",

I’m trying to limit those days where I wake up and all I think about is that.\n\n2. Are you ready to date again?\n\nI feel it’s best for me right now to be alone and write about what I’ve gone through. That’s how I deal with it. I would hate to jump into something so quickly and have it not be the right thing, because I don’t think I could take that right now.\n\n3. You added the break-up song “Forever and Always” to your album last minute. Why?\n\nI’d never had that happen to me before that way, with that abruptness. I thought to myself, “This needs to be said.” It’s a song about watching somebody completely fade away in a relationship and wondering what you did wrong and wondering why things have changed.\n\n4. Do you still believe in love?\n\nOf course! You know what? I’m going to meet somebody someday who is so wonderful, and I’m not even going to remember the other guys. Later on I definitely want to fall in love and get married and have kids. I believe in love completely, wholeheartedly.\n\n5. You’re 18 but still choose to live at home with your parents. Why?\n\nThey give me space, but I’ve still got people to talk to when I get lonely. My three closest friends [Kellie Pickler, Selena Gomez, and Abigail Anderson] aren’t in Nashville most of the time, and I’m afraid of what happens to people when they get lonely.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift’s enormous success throws a giant shadow over all of popular music, but especially so over country music. A self-made teenage artist suddenly dwarfing all acts? She has done it.\n\nBut she is not, as many experts are predicting, leading a massive shift in country music to very young audiences. She is her own massive shift.\n\nPeople forget that Swift created her audience where none existed before: She invented the audience of teenage female country music fans. Why have they flocked to her in such numbers? Because she is one of them. She knows what they’re thinking, what they like and dislike, what they’re passionate about. She writes their songs for them. No adult songwriters working in the tune factories in Nashville could have written such music credibly, nor could the major country labels have found a way to deliver it credibly to teenage audiences. Of course, it never occurred to anyone in the adult music world that such a thing was possible. An indie label, Big Machine, did help her deliver her music in the CD and digital worlds after she had already amassed a huge online audience.\n\nSwift invented herself as an artist. It took her years, but she worked at it. It was a brilliant strategy, made all the more ingenious because it was genuine. And it’s probably impossible to recreate.\n\nTaylor went directly to those girls where they live. On the Internet. I think it’s as simple as that. And they responded. It’s a rare example of true peer-group artist-to-audience direct connection. Teenagers, especially, have a keen built-in bullshit detector. They saw in Swift a fellow spirit, one who is accessible to them. She is their BFF.\n\n \n\nBut I don’t think she’s indicative of a mass movement. In the wake of the CMA Awards show a few days ago, people started saying that everything is different now because of the new youth movement. One radio expert, Tim Riley, was widely quoted as saying that the country youth movement is here. Said Riley, in part, “I think the CMA finally made history tonight. We as an industry should realize that the 49-54-plus audience is gone. Thank God. … Country radio now belongs to a much younger audience.”\n\n \n\nWell, it really doesn’t. Another expert, Sean Ross of Edison Media Research, cautioned that, in fact, that was not likely to happen overnight, and he reminded everyone that elder country statesman George Strait had in fact won two awards on that CMA show. Ross does argue credibly that there is a generational split underway in country music, one that sees radio aiming music more toward the 25-34 audience than the 45-54. In the past, he observes, the music — then leaning toward a more traditional sound — could be shared by a 45-year-old listener and a 27-year-old listener. Not necessarily so with modern country.\n\n \n\nOne thing that no one has pointed out is that country radio did not make Taylor Swift a star. Taylor Swift made herself a star, with the help of MySpace and judicious use of the Internet.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Nashville(hype)!\nPosted on December 18, 2008\nBy Paul\n\nStepping off Music Row and into the small but stylish lobby of Big Machine Records, a visitor quickly realizes it’s not just the walls that reveal the story of Taylor Swift’s meteoric rise to stardom. Even the floors have a tale to tell. With much of the vertical real estate already claimed by industry awards, framed national magazine covers, and gold and platinum records, the staff has adopted the tactic of neatly stacking the continuous stream of accolades and achievements along the baseboards. All that’s needed is a break in a busy intern’s schedule to grab a hammer, a few nails and search out any open wall space.\n\n \n\nThe photo most often found framed inside with all that precious metal is certainly a familiar one to millions of her fans: the cover of her first album, 2006’s Taylor Swift. Knowing what we know now about Taylor, it’s a striking image. Gazing back at us are the calm yet intense eyes of a sixteen-year-old girl who knows she has much to say, but isn’t really sure if anyone will want to listen. \n\n“It’s crazy, the first time making an album, not knowing if people are going to care what I write in a song,” Swift admits. “And then the second time around … knowing that there are people who are going to know the lyrics that mean so much to me. It makes it all worthwhile.” \n\nA second time around. It’s hard to believe it’s already time for Taylor to follow up her triple platinum debut. Especially considering that, two years after its release, it is still near the top of the country charts. \n\nWhat’s even harder to believe is that Taylor Swift has yet to turn nineteen. \n\nAnd when it came time to put a name to her sophomore effort, Swift decided on one word that just might be the perfect adjective to describe her journey to this moment. FEARLESS. \n\nAfter all, this is the girl who, at the tender age of 10, had the guts to take the stage at every karaoke contest, festival, and county fair that passed through her hometown of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. This is the girl, who at age 11, took a trip to Music City and left in her wake a trail of amused receptionists as she dropped off her homemade demo tape at every label in town. This is the girl who, at only 14, relocated with her entire family to Nashville to sign a songwriting deal with one of the most prestigious publishers in all of music. This is the teenager who signed her first record deal before she could drive. Who sidestepped the major labels in town to take a chance with a smaller start-up label. Who had the guts to step from an ACM awards stage and into the audience to introduce herself to Tim McGraw live on national television – just seconds after playing the last chord of her first hit song that bears his name. \n\nIt’s safe to say Taylor Swift knows a thing or two about being FEARLESS.\n\n \n\n“It’s a big deal to title your album, so I wanted to make sure that it was the right call,” says Taylor. “I started thinking about the word ‘fearless’ and what it means to me. It isn’t that you’re completely unafraid. I think fearless is having fears, but jumping anyway.” \n\nJump? With this record, Taylor Swift takes a flying leap.FEARLESS is a creative snapshot of an undeniable talent taking the next big step, both in her life and in her music. The high school freshman who once sang of “trying to find a place in this world” has now seen so much more of it. It shows in the new music. \n\n“I think that when you grow up two years, you learn a few things,” reflects Taylor. “Some people have been saying that the songs seem more mature. You know, I wasn’t really going for that. I just wrote what was happening to me. I grew up a little bit and that came into my songwriting.” \n\nIt’s important to remember here — these are truly her words. Following an impressive trend established on her debut CD, Taylor has once again written or co-written all 13 songs onFEARLESS – including eight tracks by herself. Songwriting is a craft Taylor has been honing since first strumming a chord on a guitar at the age of 12. By that evening, she had written her first tune. She was hooked. Her life became consumed with songs. Every spare moment was spent writing, playing, or thinking about music. Even while hitting the books as a straight-A student at Hendersonville High School, just outside of Nashville, she was doodling lyrics in the margins of her notebooks. \n\nEven now, with her life barreling down the country music fast lane, Taylor still makes it a priority to put the guitar, pen, and paper she keeps nearby to good use. And it’s not easy with her schedule. After signing her record deal, Taylor left her high school locker behind to be home-schooled out on the road. Now instead of English and Latin class, Taylor has been studying George Strait, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Brad Paisley and Rascal Flatts on tour. Instead of class pictures, she’s posing for the covers of Rolling Stone, Billboard and Seventeen.\n\n \n\nNow, more than ever, making music has become her way of making sense of all the madness. Writing songs helps her stay grounded as her career launches into the stratosphere. But for listeners popping in Taylor’s new CD and expecting to hear a laundry list of lyrics on the plight of country music superstar rising through the ranks, FEARLESS is going to surprise you. \n\n“I didn’t want to write songs about being on the road and being in hotels and missing your family and missing your friends,” insists Taylor. “When I was like 14 or 15 and I would hear those things on an album…being alone, living out of a suitcase… and I was always like, ‘Ugh, skip!’ I’m inspired by boys and love. Those are my favorite things to write about and I don’t think that that is limited to high school. I’d rather write songs about how I’m feeling and the relationship side of things.” \n\n\nAs we quickly realize from several of the tracks on FEARLESS, Taylor has found out relationships only get more complicated with age. Songs like “You’re Not Sorry,” “Tell Me Why,” “Forever & Always,” and “White Horse,” the latter of which debuted in the 2008 season opener of the primetime drama “Grey’s Anatomy,” find Taylor has learned that “happily ever after” endings are not always a given. \n\n“I think I’m very fascinated by the differences between reality and fairy tales,” Taylor says. “When we’re little, we read these books and we see cartoons and the bad guy is always wearing black. You always know who he is. But in real life, the bad guy can be incredibly charming and have a great smile and perfect hair. He says things that make you laugh and he’s sweet and he’s funny, but you don’t realize that he’s going to cause you a lot of pain.” \n\nBut lest you think it’s all ogres and trolls reeking havoc on the landscape of Taylor’s love-life there is a welcomed cameo from a prince charming or two riding to the rescue. \n\nThe album’s first single, “Love Story,” offers up a countrified version of Shakespeare’s play that is anything but a tragedy. In Taylor’s world, Romeo is still breathing when the curtain closes…and Juliet has a ring on her finger. And in the incredibly infectious “Hey Stephen,” Taylor proves she truly is FEARLESS by singing about a secret crush – who will most assuredly not remain a secret for long. Yes, the boy really exists. And yes, Stephen is his real name. “He has no idea the song is written about him,” Taylor says with laugh. “It’s someone who I’ve always been friends with and always kind of had a thing for…and he doesn’t know. It’s always fun for me to put something on the album that is personal. Something I know I’m going to have to deal with when the record comes out.”\n\n \n\nShe even leaves listeners with a positive vibe. The album’s final track is a song Taylor wrote to inspire her during some of the tougher moments in the early going of her career. “There were times I was working so hard that I didn’t realize that every single day our numbers were getting bigger,” Taylor remembers. “Every single day, our fan base was growing. Every single day, the work that we were doing was paying off. Then, during the 2007 CMA Awards, when they called out my name as the Horizon Award winner, I looked over and saw the president of my record label crying. Walking up those stairs, it just occurred to me that that was the night things changed. It changed everything.” \n\nSome things for Taylor, however, have stayed the same. Her steady creative partner Liz Rose is back on board. Rose was a co-writer with Taylor on seven songs from her debut album, and was the first person to encourage her to release “Tim McGraw” out into the world. \n\nTaylor has also invited three more talents in to the writing mix on FEARLESS. After getting the title track off the ground with Rose, Taylor called on songwriter Hillary Lindsey to help bring the song in for a landing. Blown away by pop songwriter Colbie Caillat’s talents on her debut album CoCo, Taylor immediately reached out to her to collaborate. The result is “Breathe,” with Caillat adding vocals to the track. “I think she sounds beautiful on it,” gushes Taylor. \n\nAnd the final pairing brought two country forces of nature together in the same Music City studio. Taylor Swift, meet John Rich. \n\n“It was always one of my goals to write with John,” says Taylor. “I had heard so many things about him. I just wanted to see what it was like to get into a room with him because I know I’m a very opinionated writer and I knew he was a very opinionated writer. So I knew this was either going to be the best thing in the world or was just going to be a complete train wreck.” Not only does the song they created stay on the tracks, it’s proof that two great cooks can rock a kitchen. Taylor and John clicked in a big way recording “The Way You Loved Me,” a song about the age-old story of a good girl pining after a bad boy. \n\nAs if writing every song on the album and living the life of a country superstar wasn’t enough, Taylor added even more to her workload when recording FEARLESS. She joins Nathan Chapman, the main man behind the board for her debut album, as a co-producer on the record. “All the songs for the second record, it’s like they were already produced in my head,” recalls Swift. “When I was writing a song, I knew what every instrument was doing. The strings, mandolin, banjo, or dobro. I heard it all. It was just really cool to have all those instruments I heard end up on the album.”\n\nBut even as she experiments with new sounds and new directions for her music, Taylor Swift knows the power of a song begins and ends with its lyrics. And it is in two of the softer, more stripped down moments on FEARLESS – the tracks “Fifteen” and “Best Day” — that Taylor’s extraordinary gift for writing shines the brightest as she remembers fondly moments from her past. \n\nWe’ve always known Taylor was an old soul, but songs with this level of reflection from someone still so young – they can leave you shaking your head in amazement. Then you remember she’s just a few years removed from her own freshman year – and you understand why her fans, including her over 1 million friends on her MySpace page, love her. She puts to music exactly what they are feeling. \n\n“I want my fans to know – I’m the same girl I was when the first album came out,” says Taylor. “I’m just not in high school and I have a different schedule. I feel the same things, I feel the same way. And my songs are where I’ll never hold back.” \n\nThat is music to a Taylor Swift fan’s ears.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Tennessean: Taylor Swift’s red-hot Sales Defy Country’s Fall\n\nBy Peter Cooper 01.01.09\n\nThe Nielsen Co.’s year-end report is in, and the story for music sales in 2008 involves doom, gloom and Taylor Swift.\n\nSwift, the 19-year-old country star who helped ring in the new year with a Dick Clark’s Rockin’ Eveperformance Wednesday, was 2008’s overall top-selling artist, with 4 million in total sales and two albums in the all-genre top 10, according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nEven with Swift’s commercial heft, the Nashville-based country music industry dropped with a thud, though not from a terribly high place. Country sales — which include tallies from albums not played on mainstream country radio, such as the Robert Plant/Alison Krauss Raising Sand collaboration — wound up at around 47,650,000. That’s down 24 percent from last year’s total. And last year’s total was the lowest for country in SoundScan’s 19-year history. Only classicalmusic had a bigger dip, at 26 percent.\n\n\nSales of Christian and Gospel music, much of which is produced in the Nashville area, were down 12 percent for the year.\n\nAlbum sales declined 14 percent across every genre, and though growth in overall music purchases is up 10 percent, that increase relies on digital tracks, ringtones and other comparatively small purchases.\n\nEven in digitally downloadable form, the album is something of an endangered species: Digital album sales decreased by 8.6 percent.\n\n“We’re in a moment of transition,” said Scott Borchetta, president of Big Machine Records (yes, Swift’s label). “If we’re smart, there’s still a lot of business out there. But extravagances are gone for the moment.”\n\nSwift’s broad appeal\n\nIn a recent interview with trade publication Country Aircheck, Sony Nashville Chairman Joe Galante declined to predict that the coming year will include much in the way of an upswing.\n\n“You have to go back to the ’80s to find that level of sales,” Galante told the magazine. “I don’t believe what we’re seeing right now is cyclical; I believe this is a permanent change.”\n\nThough country’s decline was the steepest of any popular music genre, the format remains an integral part of the American radio airwaves.\n\nAccording to Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems, six of the top 10 most-played artists on American radio — Swift, Rascal Flatts, Toby Keith, Tim McGraw, George Strait and Alan Jackson — were from the country genre.\n\nSwift was the eighth-most-played artist on radio, but she dominated other solo artists in terms of sales. She also was the top-selling artist during the just-passed holiday season.\n\n“One place we cleaned up was gift-giving,” Borchetta said. “Taylor is a great role model, and parents felt good about going out and getting her music for their kids. She’s connecting with her core age demographic, and speaking right to them at a very interesting time. Her fans feel like she’s their best friend, and she feels like they are her best friend.”\n\nVinyl makes comeback\n\nAmid the digital hubbub, sales of vinyl albums increased a remarkable 89 percent. Vinyl still accounts for a tiny portion of the overall market — Radiohead’s In Rainbows ranked No. 1 on the vinyl list, at 25,800 copies — but total vinyl sales are higher than they’ve been since SoundScan began tracking music sales in 1991. More than two of three vinyl albums sold in 2008 were purchased at independent record stores. It’s a little business, but it’s a little booming. In Nashville, indie stores such as Grimey’s, Ernest Tubb Record Shops, Great Escape, The Groove and Phonoluxe sell new vinyl.\n\nLouis Charette, 28, opened The Groove in East Nashville the day after Thanksgiving last year. Part of vinyl’s increasing draw, he figures, comes with more recent releases’ best-of-both-worlds approach — many new vinyl albums offer free mp3 download cards along with the tangible product.\n\n“(Buyers) have the record and they have the nice artwork and get to read the liner notes, but they can also throw something on their iPod,” he said.\n\nAnother vinyl strength, Charette says, is its growing ability to draw in fans that span generations.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Visits Backstage at Saturday Night Live\nJanuary 9, 2009; Written by CMT.com Staff\n\nTaylor Swift is taking a bite out of the Big Apple this weekend as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live on Jan. 10. Taking a quick break from rehearsals, the 19-year-old singer-songwriter talks about growing up with the show, bawling her eyes out for her new music video and not believing everything the record label president tells her.\n\nCMT: Did you know you're the youngest country artist to ever perform on Saturday Night Live?\n\nSwift: I was just told that. I can't believe it. That never occurred to me that that statistic was there. It feels like everything in the last couple of months was a dream and I'm just walking around in it. I can't believe it.\n\nAre you a big Saturday Night Live fan?\n\nI'm a huge Saturday Night Live fan. When I was younger -- when I was about 10 or 11 -- I was part of a children's theater group and we would always have this little sketch thing that we'd put together, and it was all basically off of Saturday Night Live. So I used to watch every episode. I cannot believe that I get to be here and actually do this. This is one of those dreams that I put up here on a shelf and I never thought I'd get to do.\n\nWhat can you tell us about your new video, \"White Horse\"?\n\nThe video was directed by Trey Fanjoy. She's done all my videos, and it's been really fun working with her. This video's a lot different than the other videos we've made because usually we've gone for bright colors and me looking straight into the camera and singing. But this one, it's a little more introspective. There's a pretty emotional scene in there where I had to cry for like three hours, like bawl my eyes out for three hours. It was really interesting and sort of a new thing for me. Stephen Colletti's in it, so I'm really excited about that. ... I saw him on One Tree Hill and thought he was really awesome on that. I thought he had the look we were going for, for the video guy. This guy in the video is supposed to look really sweet, and someone who looks like he'd never lie to you -- but then he does. So I thought he'd be perfect for it and he actually does an amazing job.\n\nYou're still the No. 1 artist on the Billboard 200 chart this week.\n\nI cannot believe that! I get a phone call from my record label president every single week and he's telling me something new, starting out with \"You're not going to believe this, but ... it's No. 1 again.\" And I honestly can't believe that. The fans have been so good to me. I spent two years making this album and writing it and putting everything I have into it. The fact that people actually like it, somehow I can't believe it.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Five Questions with Taylor Swift\nPublished: Jan 20, 2009\nCheck out our Born To Lead issue to find out how our cover girl became a self-made success. Here, she opens up about her secret obsessions, her rough high school years, and why she's proud to be a good girl.\n\nA LOT OF YOUR SONGS ARE ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT. WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO OTHER GIRLS WHO ARE GOING THROUGH HEARTBREAK?\n\nYour feelings so are important to write down, to capture, and to remember because today you're heartbroken, but tomorrow you'll be in love again. And you'll appreciate it more when you can go back and read your journal and realize that the happiness you have is special because yesterday, you cried. I'm so lucky that I get to look at journals from when I was 13 and wanted [a singing career] so bad, but never thought that I would be able to have it, or to get to be on the cover of CosmoGirl.\n\nSO YOU DIDN'T EXPECT SUCCESS?\n\nNo! The reason I was so driven was that I didn't expect that anything would just happen for me. But that doubt fueled me to work harder. My attitude was the opposite of people who are like, \"It's gonna happen for me. It's gonna happen for me.\" My mantra was always, \"It's not gonna happen for me. Go out and play that show or it won't happen.\" You know? I never expected anything to be given to me.\n\nNOW THAT YOU'VE BECOME SO SUCCESSFUL, WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY?\n\nWhat makes me happy is just curling up in with my mom in her bed and watching a marathon of CSI and Grey's Anatomy episodes with pints of ice cream. It's amazing when we get to do that. I think that what people always want is what they don't have a lot of, and the thing that I haven't had a lot of lately is getting to curl up in bed and watch a marathon of my favorite shows!\n\nYOU'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL DESERTED YOU ONE DAY. HOW DID THAT AFFECT THE PERSON YOU ARE NOW?\n\nI think the tiniest little thing can change the course of your day, which can change the course of your year, which can change who you are. I'm not quite sure how it affected me to lose all my friends and have to walk into school and go at it alone, but I can only hope that it made me a stronger person. And I got to write songs about it — my first songs were written because of trying to deal with that emotion. I will never be able to thank those people enough because it's like, you can't write a song if you're not feeling anything, and sometimes, even though you have to be feeling pain, it's worth it in the end. But it's so funny because even when I go back to high school now, when I go back to functions like a football game or a band concert or something like that, it doesn't matter how many people come up and ask me for my autograph, if I see like one of those popular people, I still feel like my hair is frizzy and people are looking at me.\n\nYOU'RE KNOWN FOR BEING CAREER-FOCUSED AND NOT PARTYING. DO YOU CONSCIOUSLY TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT SCENE?\n\nNo, I'm just being myself. I'm not a party girl at this point in my life. It's not a priority for me. I have to get up early and do interviews and I have to sing every night. I don't have any interest in going out to clubs right now. I love people, and I love socializing, I just don't have any interest in being drunk. I don't worry about [people who say I'm too much of a good girl] because the people who say that, it's like, wow, you are really trying to find something you don't like about me. And, honestly, if somebody wants to criticize me for not being a trainwreck, that's fine with me!",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Partial] I'm the kind of person,\" Taylor Swift explains, \"who needs to feel like everything happens for a reason. When you date a guy and it goes badly, that's horrible. But if you can write a song about it, then it was worth it.\" By that standard, the petit tragedies of Taylor's teenage years are looking pretty close to priceless: Her self-titled 2006 debut, which took as its subject matter the artist's life as a young girl, sold more than 3 million copies. And Fearless, her double-platinum follow-up (which features at least one song written about her most famous ex, Joe Jonas) debuted atop the Billboard 200. \"I never expected all this would happen to me,\" the nineteen-year-old says. But in the midst of the madness—she's been planning her first big U.S. headlining tour, which starts in April—Taylor shut off her cell phone (current ring tone: Carly Simon's \"You're So Vain\") and spent a couple of hours talking to Teen Vogue.\n\nTeen Vogue: You grew up in a town called Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, listening to the Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain. When—and why—did you first come to Nashville?\nTaylor Swift: Well, I started begging my mom to bring me here after I saw a TV special on Faith Hill—she came to Nashville, and that's how she made it. So for spring break we rented a car and drove up and down Music Row, handing my homemade demo CD to the receptionists at all the labels. I'd say, \"Hey, I'm eleven, and I want a record deal. Call me.\"\n\nTV: How'd that work out for you?\nTS: It didn't. And I realized that I needed to find a way to have a fighting chance of making it. So I started writing songs and playing the guitar. I actually learned on a twelve-string, purely because some guy told me that I'd never be able to play it, that my fingers were too small. Anytime someone tells me that I can't do something, I want to do it more.\n\nTV: Was country music popular in your hometown?\nTS: Not at all. The kids at school thought it was weird that I liked country—they'd make fun of me. Junior high was actually sort of hard, because I got dumped by this group of popular girls. They didn't think I was cool or pretty enough, so they stopped talking to me.\n\nTV: And then in the ninth grade, you signed a song-writing deal, moved to Nashville, and here you are. Did you ever see those girls again?\nTS: Actually, I did! I played a hometown show about a year into my career, and they showed up, wearing my T-shirts and asking me to sign their CDs. It was bittersweet, because it made me realize that they didn't remember being mean to me and that I needed to forget about it, too. And really, if I hadn't come home from school miserable every day, maybe I wouldn't have been so motivated to write songs. I should probably be thanking them!\n\nTV: Totally! Since you're known for writing very honest, almost confessional lyrics, everything is fair game. Has that changed the way you approach your relationships?\nTS: Well, I'm typically single. I'm the girl who—I call it girl-next-door-itis--the hot guy is friends with and gets all his relationship advice from but never considers dating. Right now I'm not opposed to falling in love, but I'm also not exactly out there looking.\n\nTV: Does success make it easier to meet people?\nTS: It's weird—I thought I'd have so many more friends, but I feel like I'm less popular than I've ever been. It makes me value the people I can trust even more; I still have the same best friend I had all through high school.\n\nTV: You're playing yourself in the Hannah Montana movie. Are you interested in acting?\nTS: Only if it was a show that I loved, like CSI or Grey's Anatomy, or if it was a really cool script. But I'm not feeling this desperate urge.\n\nTV: On Fearless, you sing about your penchant for T-shirts and sneakers, and you're the face of the denim line L.e.i. But it seems like you've been busting out some pretty glamorous looks on the red carpet lately.\nTS: Thank you! I've learned a lot. I go to all these photo shoots, and each time I figure out something new about myself and what I want to wear. For a big night, I like Marchesa or Badgley Mischka—and I love Oscar de la Renta. I've never gotten to wear one of his dresses; if I ever did, I would probably faint. And I am obsessed with high heels.\n\nTV: Does it feel strange to have so many people taking your picture all the time?\nTS: Well, I've never had paparazzi in Nashville before; that's a new thing. You really have a lot of privacy here. I saw that documentary on Britney Spears, and I feel bad for her—she can't leave her house!\n\nTV: At what point did you realize you finally made it?\nTS: Oh, no, I'm never going to have that moment. All of this is amazing, but it doesn't guarantee anything about the future. I still haven't made it to where I want to be.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor’s Time: Catching Up With Taylor Swift\nSinger-songwriter reflects on her big year (rapping! Grammy nods!) and previews 2010\n\nBy Austin Scaggs \n\nIn a hilariously candid interview in our current issue, Taylor Swift opens up about her Shakira impression and the koi pond she’s building in her new apartment. Here’s more from the Q&A that you won’t find in the magazine: Swift on her love of John Mayer, bling and last-minute song-writing binges.\n\nCheck out photos of Taylor’s swift rise to stardom.\n\nHow did you spend the holidays?\nI was back in Nashville, and it was pretty cool — my brother’s leaving for college next year and I’m moving out in a few months, so this was sort of a moment in time for me, I was definitely recording all of it in my mind, the last Christmas with all of us being in the same place.\n\nWhere were you when the ball dropped on New Year’s Eve?\nI was texting Hayley [Williams, of Paramore] to let her know I got home from dinner, and that my paranoid thoughts of getting in a car wreck were unwarranted. So I think I texted her something like, “Don’t worry about me, I’m not dead,” and I looked at the clock and it was midnight. So I actually got to experience looking at the clock when it struck midnight, and that was a really fun moment for me, it was the most unconventional New Year’s Eve I’ve ever had.\n\nAlso, my brother had a party, and I walked through and I said hello. A lot of the kids were in my video for “You Belong With Me,” because I shot my video for that song at Pope John Paul High School. When I’m playing the mean girl cheerleader and I’m flirting with some other guy on the football field, that other guy is just one of my brother’s friends.\n\nCan you tell me about any of the influences we might hear on your next record?\nI’m always going to love Keith Urban, I’m always going to love John Mayer. I’m always going to love people like that, who I feel are truly authentic, and that’s not to say that my music will ever sound like theirs, but I’m inspired by people who I feel know exactly who they are, and that inspires me to continue to figure out and inform who I am as an artist.\n\nWhat I was getting at was when are you going to start rapping? I thought T-Sweezy was one of the highlights of 2009.\nDid you really? [Laughs] The CMT Awards asked me, “Do you want to be a part of our intro?” and one of the first things that came to my mind was that I really, really want some excuse to be able to rap and go to the mall and go to those kiosk things and go buy bling and experience rapping in front of a car with spinners for the first time. T-Pain agreed to it and flew to Nashville and we were in a sweltering hot, 95-degree parking garage for an entire day shooting — I will never, ever forget that memory.\n\nI’m inspired by all kinds of different sounds, and I don’t think I’d ever be someone who would say, “I will never make a song that sounds a certain way, I will never branch outside of genres,” because I think genres are sort of unnecessary walls. I’ve been really lucky to have experienced that firsthand, with people taking down those walls for me little by little — I’ve been very lucky that country radio and pop radio have both been so wonderful to me. But when I hear a great song, I can’t help but be inspired by it, regardless of whatever genre that song falls under.\n\nTell me about your Grammy predictions, what do you think is going to happen?\nI predict that I will be there. I’m planning on performing, and that’s really all that I can predict. You never know what’s going to happen. I like being nominated for eight, I’m not going to lie. I like that feeling. It makes me smile. All I know is that I’m a really, really happy person, thinking about being nominated for eight of them, and I think that’s a gift in itself, so we’ll see what happens in L.A.\n\nWhat’s the status of the next album, are you talking about getting it out this year?\nI like to have two years in between albums, so if you take Fearless and go forward two years, that’s my ideal place to put out the next record, because I think two years of growth and development and feelings and life intake, love intake, emotion output, is my preferred formula for albums right now.\n\nDoes that mean now that you’re 20, you’re done writing for that last album, is it that strict?\nAbsolutely not, I write as life happens to me, and I’m writing so much lately. It’s been crazy. So I think that it’s fun making an album, knowing that two days before you’re scheduled to have the last master in, and everything finished, and they’re about to go print up the booklets, I can write something, call up my producer, we can get in the studio, put a rush on it, get an overnight mix, and that can be a last-minute addition to the record. I’ve had that happen on both my first and second album, the last minute, 11th hour songs.\n\nThat was “Love Story,” right?\n“Love Story” wasn’t technically the last one, but it was very, very last minute. The two songs that were completely last minute were, on the first record, “Should Have Said No,” and on the second album, “Forever and Always.” Both of them had to do with something really, really dramatic and crazy happening to me and me needing to address it in the form of music.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Speaks Out\n\nTaylor Swift spent 2009 grabbing headlines as she catapulted herself into the Country Music limelight with her enigmatic new album Fearless and her highly publicised relationship with Joe Jonas. I caught up with the beautiful Taylor to find out what 2009 holds for her.\n\nHey Taylor, how’s it going; are you all snowed in?\n\nNo! It’s not snowing over here, I live in Tennessee so it’s actually pretty warm here right now but I just got back from Toronto where it was soooo freezing!\n\nWhat else is happening at the moment for you then?\n\nIt’s really exciting for me at the moment; I just announced my first Europe headlining tour for this tour and I’m really excited for that and I’ve been planning it all and I’m actually on my way to rehearsals right now, so that’s my number one priority at the moment.\n\nHow has the reaction to your new record Fearless been?\n\nI am still blown away from the wonderful reaction to the record, from the things the critics have said to the fact that people are actually going out and buying the album. I think the best thing for me is when it topped the harts because I don’t think I ever predicted that would happen! So it’s definitely been a great couple of months for me, I am so excited and so happy.\n\nHow would you describe your sound in five words?\n\nLyrical - because it’s written about love. It’s hard to categorise my sound I guess, but they’re all about love.\n\nTo anyone who hasn’t heard of you yet, what one song would you recommend they listen to so that they fall in love with you?\n\nWell it depends on what kind of day you’re having. If you’re happily in a relationship your should listen to Love Story. If you’re sad and depressed, listen to You’re Not Sorry. I think that those two are my top two today, but it changes daily!\n\nWho do you think is the best musician around at the moment?\n\nKeith Urban; I love Keith Urban so much, he‘s a great guitar player. He’s one of my favourites and I’m actually going on tour with him this summer and I’m really excited about that.\n\nWhat has been the highlight of your career so far?\n\nThere was a performance I did for the ACM (Academy Of Country Music) awards where I sang my song Should Have Said No and at the end of the song, all of this water started pouring down from the ceiling and it was like a down pour on the stage and I was just playing underneath all this water and it was so much fun!\n\nAlso performing on Saturday Night Live was a great highlight for me.\n\nSo if you could change one thing about your life or career at the moment, what would it be?\n\nI would go to the UK more! I love it over there, especially when it’s snowing!\n\nNo! It’s cold and you can’t land in London! How do you cope with the hoards of media attention you must be getting?\n\nWell I live in Nashville rather than LA or New York so I don’t have to deal with the paparazzi or anything so it takes a lot of the stress off me but it’s hard going out to the Mall or for something to eat because people want pictures or autographs, but essentially it’s a good thing because it’s what you’ve always wanted so I never want to be that girl who wants something so badly her entire life and then hates it when she gets it.\n\nYou also have a project with Levi’s going on at the moment, what’s that all about?\n\nIt’s actually a line of sundresses for Walmart that are really light and basic and pretty and they’re going to be really inexpensive, like $14 (£7) and with the economy doing what it’s doing it doesn’t make any sense to put out expensive dresses. These are cute and affordable!\n\nIf they come to the Asda over here I will definitely buy one! Anyway, we ask everyone we interview to come up with a question for the next person we interview, and Jem wants to know, “What one song do you sing in the shower?”\n\nMetro Station - Shake It. I love that song, it’s been stuck in my head like crazy.\n\nSo can you come up with a question for the next person I interview please?\n\nWhat’s the best Valentine’s Day you ever had?",

She wore a Collette Dinnigan dress,Christian Louboutin shoes, carried a Jimmy Choo bag and wore Lorraine Schwartzjewelry.\n\nThe Dish Rag asked Taylor why she chose this pewter and silver dress, what she’s wearing to the Grammy Awards  and she, in turn, gives us some good dish on her “CSI” role.\n\nWhy did you choose this dress?\nTS: I chose tonight’s dress because I’m automatically attracted to sparkly dresses –- I have a thing for sparkly dresses.\n\nHow about your Grammy gown?\nTS: Tomorrow’s dress is long! It’s not sparkly, believe it or not, and is it bright? Maybe! Maybe not!\n\nTell us about your role on “CSI?”\nTS: “CSI” was awesome.  I was in L.A. shooting for two weeks and I had all these different hair colors and styles and I changed my look a million times. I’ve always wanted to do that so to also do it on my favorite show is pretty unforgettable.\n\nDo you die on the episode?\nTS: No, but I get injured. I have yet to confirm whether or not there is a death involved. I am definitely injured and there are scissors involved.\n\nYikes!\nWhat do you think of the sparkly frock? Pretty or pretty awful? To be honest, we’ve seen her do better. A lot better.",

You think youre all alone. When youre 15, you think youre the only person in the world feeling this way? Youre not.\n\nLooking back at being 15, I wouldnt have changed anything. If I had been popular, I would have been perfectly content with staying where I was.It just wasnt the cool thing to be trying to do anything different, and I think that caused me to spend a lot of time alone  and spending a lot of time alone gave me a lot of time to think, and having a lot of time to think allowed me to write songs.\n\nIn high school, its cool to be different. And the farther away you get from middle school, junior high, the more you realize that. In the real world, if you have something about yourself thats different, youre lucky. Its not a curse.\n\nDont make high school everything. Because if high school is everything, then youve got a long life to live, and Id like to think that the best years of my life are still ahead of me.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift... The Interview!\n\nVicki Vicki | 11:14 UK time, Tuesday, 17 February 2009\nTaylor Swift is seriously hot news right now. Like, seriously. Already an absolute MEGASTAR in the USA (she broke records by having two different albums in the Top 10 on the year end album chart), Taylor's had cameos in CSI and Hannah Montana, been linked to Joe Jonas (of Jo Bro fame), is best buds with a certain Miss Miley Cyrus and, if all that's not enough, she's about to take the UK completely by storm.\n\nI had the pleasure of chatting to Taylor about all sorts of Absolutely Essential things, such as Grey's Anatomy, trivia quizzes, ukuleles and favourite jokes. So read on, read on... because in a few months time, this is the stuff you'll be dying to know about the world's biggest star.\n\nMaybe.\n\nBrrrring, brrring (that's the telephone ringing)\nTaylor: Hello?\n\nTaylor! So, here you are, in the UK. Have you got three things that you love most about being over here?\nTaylor: Number One: fans that make creative signs. Number Two: TopShop [she said this, not us!]. Number Three would be... the cute accents. I love being over here, the fans are amazing, everybody just seems to have such an appreciation for music.\n\nAw, you flatter us. Your new single, 'Love Song', is gorgeous. What do you love about the song?\nTaylor: It's crazy because I just found out it's the number one pop song in the US this morning! It's a song I wrote sat on my bedroom floor. When I write songs, I never know what's going to end up happening to them, I don't know if they'll end up being shelved, or if they'll end up being a number one song. So to see [Love Song] go to number one, and now be released over here... it's crazy.\n\nTell us more about the song.\nTaylor: I wrote the song about a guy I wasn't dating, but I liked him and kinda thought we were gonna start dating. For the first time in my life my family and my friends didn't approve of him, they thought he was a bad guy; they were like \"there's something about him, we don't approve.\" [Because of this] I was able to relate to the whole Romeo and Juliet situation, so I sat down and wrote that song.\n\nIsn't that Miley's boyfriend in the video to 'Love Song'? How did that work out? Any best friend type jealousy?\nTaylor: Oh, yeah! Actually, I knew him before she did.\n\nDid you introduce them?\nTaylor: No... I can't take credit for that! But I definitely met him before I knew that they were friends.\n\nIf you were really in your own love story, who would you have star opposite you?\nTaylor: Henry Cavill, from The Tudors.\n\nAre you actually swift (as in, fast) at anything? I.e. Running, swimming, writing your name backwards...\nTaylor: I'm not fast at running. I'm not fast at any kind of sports. I'm pretty fast at Trivia Games.\n\nGot a specialist subject?\nTaylor: Usually movies, TV Shows, anything celebrity related. Also, I'm pretty fast at signing my autograph!\n\nI suppose you'd have to be. So come on then, tell us: what's your favourite EVER joke?\nTaylor: My favourite kind of jokes are [...] those situational conversations. Like, last night on Grey's Anatomy there was this girl and her Dad came in and she was like \"Daddy!\", then Cristina was talking to Meredith later and Meredith was like, \"What's wrong with the patient?\" and Cristina goes, \"Well, first of all, she calls her Dad, 'Daddy'!\" (laughs) So funny.\n\nDo you play any random instruments?\nTaylor: Ukulele. I learnt to play in Hawaii.\n\nSo, you're a superstar now. What's the most popstar-ish thing you've done?\nTaylor: I bought Christian Louboutin heels. I wear them with almost everything in the winter. But they're like really nice boots! So I splurged... and that's my one popstar moment.\n\nEveryone thinks they know everything about you because you're always in the limelight, but is there anything people might be surprised to know?\nTaylor: Well... I kind of share everything! (laughs) I always forget to take off my make up off at night. I'm really lazy and sometimes I have my make up on for three days straight.\n\nAnd, finally, what are your five favourite songs at the moment?\nTaylor: 1. Katy Perry - 'Thinking of You'\n2. Kings of Leon - 'Closer'\n3. Metrostation - 'Now that we're done'\n4. HelloGoodbye - 'Here in your Arms'\n5. Faith Hill - 'Breathe'",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift's Brit Awards preview\n\nBy Greg Cochrane\nNewsbeat music reporter\n\nFor some, the sight of a ninth-month pregnant M.I.A. grinding with Jay-Z, Kanye West and Lil Wayne might have been the most bewildering one at last week's Grammys ceremony in America.\n\nHowever, for many of the British audience watching on television it would have been 19-year-old Taylor Swift performing.\n\nWho? Exactly.\n\nBack in her native US Swift is a huge star. Four million records huge but in the UK she's yet - yet! - to be a household name. Last year, Swift was the biggest selling artist in America.\n\nHuge star\n\"I stop at red lights in my car back in Tennessee I'll have the car on either side of me roll down the windows and be like handing things to me,\" she says curled up in a London hotel lounge chair.\nIt's safe to say back home Swift doesn't live a normal life - mass adulation shadowing her every move.\n\"When I go to the mall now it's definitely different to how it was a couple of years ago.\n\n        \nTaylor Swift\nRadio 1 meets Taylor Swift at a hotel in London\n\nWatch Taylor Swift being mobbed by fans outside Radio 1\n\"But I love talking to people and I feel like I'm the same person I was before all this started - I just have a different schedule now.\"\n\nThat type of mob reaction looks set to be mirrored in the UK where she was immediately greeted by hundreds of fans on her arrival.\n\n\"I was fully expecting it to just be me starting over and having no-one know who I was and having no-one care about my music,\" she blurts humbly.\n\nIndeed, a pack of salivating paparazzi were instantly trailing her movements. Not that she is bothered.\n\n\"I've wanted one thing for me whole life and I'm not going to be that girl who wants one thing her whole life then gets it and complains.\"\n\nBrits predictions\n\nAfter a brief visit last September Swift is in the UK to attend and \"observe\" the Brit Awards.\n\n\"I've heard that they're crazy,\" she giggles. \"The Grammys are very classy. It's very prestigious and everyone's on their best behaviour and I think that at the Brits everyone will be on their wildest behaviour - which will be interesting.\n\n\"It'll probably be just a little more whimsical.\n\n\"I picked out what I'm going to wear last week - I know the dress,\" she smiles. \"I think the afternoon of the Brits I'm going to try to figure out what to do with my hair.\"\n\nWhile she'll probably keep her own autograph book under wraps she's looking forward to meeting up with a few new friends.\n\n\"Chris Martin walked up to me and Miley [at the Grammys] and said 'Hey guys!' and I was like freakin' out because I'd never met him before,\" she babbles. \"He was like 'Taylor congratulations on everything you've had an amazing year' - I couldn't even believe that he knew who I was.\n\n\"Duffy, I remember meeting her at the Clive Davis party. We were all standing together, it was me Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, Miley Cyrus and Duffy.\n\n\"A fan came up and wanted his picture with us and he goes, 'Can someone take a picture of us' and Duffy says, 'Here I'll take it' and she grabs the camera and took the picture for him. She just didn't assume that she was wanted in the picture.\"\n\nTherefore the Welsh songstress is Swift's tip for best female come the ceremony at London's Earls Court on Wednesday [18 February].\n\n\"Duffy would probably be my frontrunner just because of meeting her and she was so sweet.\n\n\"But people might be surprised to figure out that I'm a big M.I.A. fan too.\"\n\nAwards success\n\nBritish artists did extremely well at the Grammys, and the Americans are expected to leave with a number of gongs at the Brits - something Swift finds curious.\n\n\"I think you could go back to the old thing about human nature and that you want what you can't have,\" she explains. \"The grass is always greener on the other side so you always admire what isn't in your backyard.\"\n\nAfter the chaotic dust of the Brits inevitably settles Swift will release new record Fearless on 2 March.\n\n\"A lot of the ideas from Fearless came from love and boys,\" she concludes. \"I wrote Love Story on my bedroom floor.\"\n\nFrom bedroom floor to Brit Awards - a real swift accent.",

      "Transcript/Content": "The sound of success\nOpen Road Recordings founder hit the big time when he hitched his wagon to an up-and-coming country star\nSTEVE LADURANTAYE\n\nFebruary 17, 2009\n\nRon Kitchener had a pretty good thing going, but the Toronto entrepreneur always knew he was one key deal away from expanding his music empire.\n\nHis Open Road Recordings country music record label had slowly built its name by signing Canadian acts such as Johnny Reid and the Road Hammers, and he watched with satisfaction as their albums became certified gold - a status bestowed on recordings selling more than 50,000 copies in Canada.\n\nMr. Kitchener's career was unfolding at a steady, if leisurely, pace when he visited Nashville in 2007 and struck a licensing deal with another relatively small label called Big Machine Records, co-founded by country music star Toby Keith.\n\nMr. Kitchener gained access to a roster of up-and-coming talent, and one fresh-faced young woman in particular caught his attention. She was a long way from last week's duet at the Grammy Awards with Miley Cyrus, but right from the start he knew that Taylor Swift was going to change the way his label did business: If he could exploit his licensing deal by marketing Ms. Swift properly in Canada and making sure her records flew off well-stocked shelves, Open Road would be poised for expansion.\n\n\"Country music has a hard time selling units in Canada unless you get one or two genuine artists that do truly break through,\" he explains. \"There are plenty of superstar artists, who I won't name, that don't sell records in Canada. Having Taylor break out was a significant bonus for us.\"\n\nIt wasn't a matter of incremental growth - before releasing Ms. Swift's Fearless album in 2007, Open Road was a one-man shop. Now, the company boasts 11 employees in Toronto and Nashville and has \"significantly\" more volume and revenues, he says. The album took the No. 1 and No. 2 slots on Billboard's 2008 Country Album Chart (Canada), making the 19-year-old singer from Pennsylvania the seventh-best-selling artist among all genres. The album went double platinum, selling more than 400,000 copies last year in Canada.\n\n\"Once people heard of her and saw her and got a sense of what she's all about - with her positive image and her good nature - she just began to shine,\" he says.\n\nAnd while his label has averaged three new releases a year since 2003, Ms. Swift's success and the corresponding bump in revenues for Open Road means it can release nine albums this year.\n\nMr. Kitchener likes to think he was sure of Ms. Swift's talent, but releasing any album in Canada is a risky proposition. It's a huge country, with divergent musical tastes, and misjudging an artist's appeal could be enough to sink a small label.\n\n\"We need to work with our distributors and retailers to make sure the product flow is something we can manage,\" he says. \"You manufacture thousands of units and ship them across the country and hope that they sell. And if they don't, they come back for a credit. And we certainly can't take a whole bunch of credit back after spending a whole bunch on marketing - we'd be out of business very quickly.\"\n\nThe flip side of the equation is that if he botched a major release, it could be difficult to sign other big names to the Open Road label.\n\n\"There's nothing more frustrating than someone in Saskatoon walking out of a store without what they want, but knowing that in Regina there are 30 pieces that nobody wants,\" Mr. Kitchener says. \"And when you realize you have a big-selling record, you've suddenly got to have more attention to detail, more eyes on the game.\"\n\nWhile there are few industries that haven't been touched by the global recession, the music business has been facing particularly difficult times over the past five years. Digital piracy has taken a toll on sales, and fewer albums are making their way off store shelves. So while he may be releasing more music this year than ever before, Mr. Kitchener is cautious about his prospects in 2009.\n\nThe label isn't his only business - he has others that deal with different aspects of the industry, such as licensing, managing and publishing. The more aspects of the industry he can cover off, the greater the odds of survival.\n\n\"The music industry has been in a recession for three times as long as what's happening out there now,\" he says. \"We've got to be very careful. The reason I have five or six businesses now really is because of the changing landscape of the business. It certainly wasn't my endeavour to go out and do all those things, but it just happens out of necessity.\"\n\n*****\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n2005\n\nYear of Open Road Recordings' first gold record, Johnny Reid's Born to Roll.\n\n2007\n\nTaylor Swift releases Fearless.\n\n400,000\n\nCanadian sales of Fearless in 2008, compared with four million in the United States.\n\n3\n\nAverage annual number of Open Road releases before Ms. Swift's success.\n\n9\n\nNumber of Open Road releases expected this year.\n\nSource: Open Road Recordings\n\n*****\n\nSNAPSHOT\n\nThe vitals\n\nA music fan from an early age, Ron Kitchener founded Open Road Recordings when he struck a partnership with Toronto-based MapleCore Ltd. and distributor Universal Music Canada in 2003. A year later, he inked a licensing deal with Nashville label Big Machine Records, which gave him the right to market and represent Big Machine's artists in Canada - including Trisha Yearwood and Taylor Swift.\n\nThe Intriguing Idea\n\nWhile Ms. Swift is now a double-platinum-selling artist in Canada, there was a brief time when it appeared Mr. Kitchener's bet might backfire. \"Radio didn't go nuts over it right away,\" he says. \"But there was an online swell - here is a great girl who appealed to everybody, who was writing blogs and had online video. She started getting all this online traction and social-networking traction as well. It's not completely new to the Nashville world, but we'd never really developed an artist through this era.\"\n\nThe Key Decision\n\nWhen he met with the Big Machine owners about licensing its artists for sales in Canada, he saw an opportunity to ride some powerful coattails. \"Of course, they are playing in a much bigger game with much bigger stakes, and there are larger investments and larger opportunities in the United States,\" he says. \"But they were doing similar things. ... It made sense.\"\n\nWhat's Next\n\n\"Business is down, so we need to cut stronger deals with our retail partners,\" he says. \"When you used to sell a record for $16.99, there was more profit. But retailers want deeper discounts, and the consumer wants a lower price. So it's a struggling business. As an overall company, we need to have little pieces of a lot of things [such as publishing rights and management fees].\"\n\nKnow a business that has experienced a big breakthrough?

      "Transcript/Content": "News of the World: Fairy Taylor Story\n\nBy Dan Wootton, 01/03/2009\n\nTHERE’S NO CHANCE AMERICA’S NEW SWEETHEART TAYLOR SWIFT WILL HEAD DOWN THE SAME PATH AS BRITNEY SPEARS.\nThe talented 19-year-old sold more than any other singer or band in America last year but is untouched by all the trappings of pop stardom.\n\nEven though she’s another bombshell blonde, Taylor doesn’t drink alcohol, hates talking about sex and even dated a virgin celebrity.\n\n“Honestly, I’ve never had this desire to be a party girl. It’s just never been a temptation for me,” she tells Rated.\n\n“In high school I watched all my friends go through the party phase and just saw them make mistakes, do things they regretted later.\n\n“I have always been so focused on having control over my actions — it would just freak me out if I couldn’t remember what I had said the night before.”\n\nDumped\nAfter wowing on the red carpet in a slinky silver dress at The Brits last week, the stunning blonde is now set to repeat her Stateside success over here.\n\nHer first single Love Story, set to hit No2 today, has already become a sensation on radio and the video is top on the iTunes chart.\n\nTaylor, who lives in Nashville, has been writing love songs for a living since she was just 14.\n\nBut she laughs: “I’d like to think that I haven’t had the great love of my life yet. I think that you don’t know real love until you’ve found it — and when you do, it erases all the other times you thought you were in love.”\n\nThe pretty blonde had her heart broken by hunky Joe Jonas, the virginal American pop star who cruelly dumped her during a 25 second phone call.\n\nBut Taylor — the most searched artist in the world on MySpace — says: “I don’t have a rule against dating celebrities. And there’s really no pressure on me as far as getting married.\n\n“I’ve always focused on the success of my career rather than the success of my relationships.” Taylor started out young on the road for pop success after being spotted by record bosses.\n\n“I worked for Sony Publishing and I signed that contract when I was 14. That became my job and I would write every day after school.\n\n“The argument I’ve always faced is that, ‘Oh you’re so young. How can you feel these things.’\n\n“I’ve always felt a lot. I’ve been inspired by simple things. I don’t need to have a relationship with someone to write a song about them.\n\n“I can see them from across a room. I can be inspired to write a song about them.”\n\nTaylor is following her best friend Miley Cyrus into acting . . . but only to be murdered on screen in a special episode of TV’s hit drama CSI.\n\n“I’ve been obsessed with that show for years,” she explains. “I’ve seen every episode from Seasons One through to Nine.\n\n“And I mentioned my obsession with the show in basically every one of my interviews so they wrote a part for me.” She adds: “This girl is 16-years-old and she changes her hair, she changes her appearance, she changes everything about herself and it’s this tragic sequence of events.”",

If we forget, this kind of crime could happen again. My parents taught me never to judge others based on whom they love, what color their skin is, or their religion. Why make life miserable for someone when you could be using your energy for good? We don't need to share the same opinions as others, but we need to be respectful.

      "Transcript/Content": "Rapid trip to the top for hot country star Taylor Swift \nBy Noel Mengel\n\nMarch 05, 2009 11:00pm\n\nTAYLOR Swift has always worn her heart on her sleeve – and she isn’t going to stop now, just because she knows a massive audience is listening.\n\nSwift, country music’s hottest new star, breezed into Brisbane to the news that her second album, Fearless, had topped the US album charts for an 11th consecutive week.\nShe’s the first person to achieve this feat since Carlos Santana 10 years ago. \nAnd all before she turns 20.\n“The one thing that has stayed normal about my life is that I am able to write my music like I’m writing a diary.\n“You can’t let the fact that millions of people are watching affect you when you are writing a song,” she said before playing theTivoli Theatre last night.\nSwift knew what she wanted to do as an 11-year-old when a man who came to fix the computer taught her three guitar chords.\nShe wrote her first song that night, and was soon begging to go to Nashville.\nThe determined primary schooler went straight into record company offices to hand over her demo CD.\n“It was a good thing I didn’t get a deal on that first trip to Nashville,” Swift says.\n“I realised that there were so many people who wanted to do exactly what I wanted to do and I had to figure out a way to make myself different.”\nSwift has an ability to articulate the small-town blues – always at the heart of great country music – in songs such as Love Story and Fifteen.\n“When I write a song I’m the only person who is feeling it and I’m singing it to the person I’m writing the song about, it’s very personal.\n“But when I put it on an album and I see girls my age singing the words back at me, I’m not alone any more.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "GOLDEN girl of pop TAYLOR SWIFT knows it’s only a matter of time before she ‘does a BRITNEY’ and goes off the rails.\n\nAnd the 19-year-old, relishing in her 10th week at No1 on the US charts, says the snappers can’t wait to capture her falling out of clubs drunk.\n\nShe said: “I definitely think there are a lot of people who are waiting for me to do something wrong and I think it’s inevitable that in my life I’m going to eventually. People do things wrong.\n\n“I’m just going to try and make it as graceful a mistake as possible when it happens. I try to make the right choices and I’m never going to sit here and guarantee that I’m not going to do something stupid because I’m very capable of that.\n\n“But I’m going to try as hard as possible not to.”\n\nThe country star, who hails LEANN RIMES and SHANIA TWAIN as her heroines, also counts a certain Brit musician among her idols.\n\nTaylor said: “Meeting CHRIS MARTIN from COLDPLAY at the Grammys was amazing. He was so incredible and so nice.\n\n“People like that really set a good example for newer artists because he’s as big as it gets with his career and he’s still the most down to earth person.”\n\nShe added: “I also had the dressing room next toKATY PERRY. We’d been talking that day, she came by and sat down and hung out for a while and then later on when I was getting ready for red carpet, putting my dress on, getting my make-up done she walks in with a pair of scissors.\n\n“And she says, ‘Hey, is it cool if I cut a piece of your hair?’ And I was like,’Umm, yeah sure, why?’ She said, ‘Well, I’m going to carry a heart-shaped purse down the red carpet and when people say, ‘Katy, what’s in your heart-shaped purse? I’m just going to say a lock of Taylor Swift’s hair.'”\n\nAnother famous friend in her telephone is Disney favourite MILEY CYRUS.\n\nThe girls both dated JONAS BROTHERS boys and star in the upcoming Hannah Montana movie together.\n\nTaylor said: “I play a song in the film, so it’s not exactly an acting cameo but it is a cameo.\n\n“I get along great with Miley, we’ve been friends for a long time so we just goof around… She’s so much fun to be around so it’s not hard at all.\n\n“The one thing that is very similar about me and Miley is that we’re both just trying to be as normal as possible and that’s how we can relate.”\n\nAlthough the country girl is yet to hit her twenties, she is wise beyond her years.\n\nTaylor said: “I’ve always wanted this and everything that comes along with it. All the stress and the hard work. I asked for all of this and getting to live this dream is such a privilege and such a blessing.\n\n“I really like doing things myself and I’m very involved in the production and business decisions and planning the stage, planning the tour and all that stuff.\n\n“Sometimes there’s a lot, but I’d rather be in charge than hand off these decisions to someone else.”\n\nShe added: “I feel like my music is my diary. I write all about what happens to me and my personal experiences.\n\n“Singing songs live, I definitely try to go back to that place where I was when I wrote it because I try to give the crowd more than they’re going to get than just by hearing the song on a radio.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Partial] Country girl remains close to her roots\n\nAt just 19, Taylor Swift appears to know how to handle her celebrity status, writes Alice Wasley\nTAYLOR Swift just might come out of all of this unscathed. She was the highestselling artist in the US last year, finished the year with her first and second album in the top 10, performed with her good friend Miley Cyrus at the Grammys, and is on the cover of US Rolling Stone. Not a bad effort for a 19-year-old country singer but, in the current celebrity climate, one that could lead to a major fall from grace.\nThe thing about Swift is that when she talks about how she handles the scrutiny and the pressure, you believe she's mature enough and smart enough not to let it turn her into the next Britney Spears.\n\"I think being normal is just not believing your own hype,\" Swift says from her home in Nashville, ahead of her Australian tour.\n\"It's all about saying to yourself, 'Yes I'm No. 1 today but tomorrow if I don't make the right choices, I could be forgotten'.\nYou have to know that and you can't ever feel like you're not going to have to take responsibility for your actions. You do.\nYou're not exempt from life and from the hard stuff.\"\nIn her rare visits home, going along to her younger brother Austin's lacrosse games is one way for Swift to remember that she's not the centre of the universe.\nAlthough when she's on the sidelines he's likely to feel like all eyes are not necessarily on his efforts as goalie.\n\"He doesn't care,\" she laughs.\n\"The funny thing about Austin is that he doesn't really care at all about how many records I've sold, he doesn't really care about how many people are coming to my concerts. That's his sister.\"\nThough it's no surprise that...",

      "Transcript/Content": "IT'S the sort of dedication that, for a teenager, is nothing short of extraordinary. The result? Well, it speaks for itself.\n\nTaylor Swift, a 19-year-old singer from Tennessee, is by far the biggest-selling recording artist in North America.\n\nThis week, her second album, Fearless, sits atop the Billboard US charts for the 12th time. It's a feat not achieved by any recording artist in a decade, let alone a teenager on her second album.\n\nYet Swift is taking it all in her stride. This weekend, she arrives in Melbourne for her first Australian tour as her album is beginning to explode on our charts.\n\nSwift's steely demeanour and hunger for success were evident in a phone interview earlier this week.\n\nSwift says that she discovered her passion for music at a freakishly young age, six, listening to LeAnn Rimes. \"I thought country was a cool kind of music and I liked all of the stories,\" she says. \"Then I was introduced to Shania Twain and Faith Hill and they became my ultimate heroes.\"\n\nFiercely ambitious, even before she was a teen, Swift and her parents ( her father was a Merrill Lynch stockbroker) decided her path to fame would be strongly American.\n\nThe Star Spangled Banner, America's national anthem, is played before every sporting event and usually requires the services of an up-and-coming vocalist. Swift worked the circuit, eventually landing a slot at the US Tennis Open.\n\nBy then, aged 14, she had signed a songwriting deal in Nashville with Sony. She would eventually score a recording contract with an indie, Big Machine Records (distributed through Universal Music in Australia).\n\nSwift says she begin to feel disconnected from her schoolmates.\n\n\"All the girls were going to parties at weekends and starting to lie to their parents about where they were, and sneaking out,\" she says. \"Instead of doing that stuff, I was at coffee houses, festivals and fairs and singing national anthems at different places, because that's what I was more interested in.\"\n\nShe would eventually leave high school in year 11 and received her high school diploma on the road. Her self-titled debut album was released as she turned 17 and sold 3 million copies.\n\nSwift's songs tell the story of high school romances gone wrong and are laden with the country harmonies and twangy guitars easily consumed by pop radio.\n\nHer fans, and she has many in the songwriting world, say lyrical honesty and simplicity are her fundamental writing skills. Put simply, without apology, she names names. \"It doesn't seem like a big deal to me,\" she says. \"I guess it is to those named. To me, it's more about telling the story with added details.\"\n\nThe protagonist behind one of her biggest US hits, Teardrops On My Guitar, even exploited it for his own personal gain. She later visited his MySpace page and saw the following line: \"Hi, I'm Drew and have a famous country song written about me, email me if you wanna know more details.\"\n\n\"Sometimes people take it as a compliment and other times I don't hear from them,\" she says. \"Other times they will show up in my driveway. I don't ever regret including personal information on my albums because it's the only way I know how to write, and to tell stories.\"\n\nThe Taylor Swift juggernaut, meantime, continues. Although U2 is expected to be the biggest US seller next week, her album is tipped to eventually spend more time at the pointy end of the chart. Then there's the fashion label she has released through retail giant Wal-Mart.\n\n\"I love what I do,\" she says. \"I am fascinated by every aspect of the music industry — singing, performing, writing, production, business, employing staff, bringing tours together.\n\n\"Being fascinated by the whole structure, has really helped moving my career along.\"\n\nTaylor Swift performs at Billboard on Monday (under 18 show) and Tuesday. Both shows are sold out.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Swift Ascent\nDOLLY's Emma V meets Taylor Swift and discovers she's the perfect antidote to trashy starlets like Paris and Lindsay, proving once and for all that nice girls really do finish first.\n\nI'm standing in the middle of an excited crowd on a Saturday night in March when a tall blonde walks onto the stage. \"I feel like we should get to know each other,\" she says into the microphone \"I'll start - my name's Taylor, I'm class of 2008, koalas ave my new favourite animal, and I officially love Australia\". The crowd roars in approval, while 19-year-old Taylor Swift grins from ear-to-ear. Watching her flit across the stage ina micro-mini green sequined dress, it's hard to believe we're just a hop, skip and jump away from Mount Kosciusko at the \"CMC Rocks the Snowys\" country music festival. But like the festival itself, which is free of line-dancing and boot- scooting. Taylor is a contradiction Born in the small US town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. Taylor surprised everyone when she developed a passion for country music \"The kids at school thought it was weird that I liked country -they'd make fun of me,\" she confessed recently. But Miss Swift didn't let a little thing like peer pressure put her off \"discovered Shania Twain, Faith [Hill] and the Dixie Chicks, and I found all these things in their songs I could relate to country music told stories that made me think.\"\n\nRELUCTANT SUPERSTAR\nAs I wait backstage for my interview with Taylor, it's obvious when she enters the room, even though I can't actually see her due to all the people trying to catch a glimpse - I haven't seen so much fuse over ane person since interviewing Jessica Alba! Despite the hangers-on and the gaggle of minders rushing around, she appears relaxed and cheerful as she records a TV interview. Watching all the craziness unfold, it's hard to believe the statuesque teen (she stands at 180cm, the same height as supermodel Gisele Bündchen) was a loner at school. \"Junior high was actually sort of hard, because I got dumped by this. group of popular girls,\" she revealed during an interview recently. \"They didn't think I was cool or pretty enough so they stopped talking to me when I'd sit down at the lunch table, they'd get up and move. Or as I was setting up my equipment to sing karaoke at the town summer festival, the kids would shout horrible things.\"\n\nTAYLOR BY NUMBERS\nCostume changes in her live show: 1 (she ripped off her black tee and jeans to reveal a green sequined shift dress) \nSigned first song-writing deal at 13 \nScored first number-one at 16\nNumber of friends on MySpace: 1,177, 650-and counting! \nNumber of albums sold: 6,000,000+\n\nTHE TAYLOR EFFECT\nFinally it's my turn to chat to Miss Swift, but before I sit down, she extends her hand and says, \"Hi, I'm Taylor.\" I'm impressed -most celebrities fail to observe basic pleasantries when you meet them. As we chat a number of things strike me: her skin is like porcelain- I have to fight the urge to ask if it's real. Her hair is her signature thing-flowing curls which are naturally honey blonde (she's never coloured her hair), and her eyes-even when the questions get more personal, her blue eyes atay fixed on me the whole time. Many industry people say it's this natural air that sets Taylor apart from other young musicians. \"I didn't want to write songs about being on the road and being in hotels and missing your family and missing your friends,\" she says. \"I'm inspired by boys and love. Those are my favourite things to write about.\" After Joe Jonas dumped her in a 27-second phone call, Tay didn't get angry: she simply used the experience to pen the track \"Forever & Always\" which was a late inclusion in her top-selling alburn, Fearless. I ask her if she worries about whether potential boyfriends will be scared off by her candid song-writing style. She pauses, before saying, \"I think my motto on that is that if guys don't want me to write bad songs about them, they shouldn't do bad things\". It's a little piece of Taylor wisdom to take home, along with a photo and a hug that makes me think we could all use a bit of Taylor's sunny outlook in our lives.\n\nTAYLOR TALKS, ER, SWIFTLY ON\n\nHER DEATHROW MEAL\n\"A huge cheeseburger, large fnes and a chocolate milkshake.\"\n\nWHAT MAKES HER SMILE\n\"When I've just figured out the perfect word to go in that gap I was missing [in a song that s when I am at my happiest.\" \n\nBEING IN LOVE\n\"I don't think I've had one great love of my life. Love is interesting because you can feel like you are in love and then after, you realise that if it had been that great love, then it would have lasted.\"\n\nHER SECRET TO MYSPACE SUCCESS.\n\"My success on MySpace has come from not treating my MySpace as a promotional site, like I just wanted to get a lot of fans and use them to buy my albuma. I just wrote on my MySpace [about] who I am as a person, what I like, what I don't like. I think that being real with people is the best that you can do Just be yourself if you keep having to reinvent yourself, eventually you'll run out of things to be.\" \n\nHER LAST BIG SPLURGE\n\"I bought a tour bus this year-that was a big splurge! But that's like where I live, so it's sort of like investing in a new house on wheels. It has a treadmill out the back, it has a shower, a complete bathroom, wood floors, a huge bed and a chandelier over the bed. It's really fun!\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Partial] In Nashville, the country-music executive Scott Borchetta scored his biggest career break by backing the singer Taylor Swift in 2005, when she was just 15 and most people in the music business believed she wasn’t ready for a solo career. Mr. Borchetta liked her blunt, edgy lyrics and thought that they could connect with other teenagers, who usually aren’t big country fans.\n\nSome young singers have seen their appeal fade fast when sudden fame proved tormenting. But Mr. Borchetta says he saw early on that Ms. Swift could thrive in the spotlight, coming across as friendly and open with almost any audience. A defining moment came in 2006, when the two visited a radio station in Bristol, Tenn., hoping to make a good impression.\n\n“Often they just say hello for a few minutes and don’t let a brand-new artist on the air,” Mr. Borchetta recalled. “But they liked one of Taylor’s songs and told her so. Without missing a beat, she replied: ‘Thank you. Can I play it right now for your listeners?’ ” The station managers couldn’t say no, and Ms. Swift’s march to the top of the charts had begun.",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Partial] “It’s fine to talk about love publicly,” the 19-year-old singer tells Allure for its April issue, “but I think when you talk about virginity and sex publicly, people just automatically picture you naked. And as much as I can prevent people picturing me naked, I’m going to.” \n\nStill, Swift thinks a lot about dating, especially its impact on her songwriting. Even a bad relationship can be a point of inspiration. \n\n“Let’s say I date a guy who really does nothing but damage me,” she says. “And you’ve spent time, you’ve spent effort, and you’ve put everything into trying to make that work. And it didn’t. So you write a song about it. It was worth everything if you write a song about it.” \n\nMany of Swift’s songs have romantic overtones, and she lists fairy tales as a big inspiration. \n\n“I have always been fascinated with fairy tales, and the idea that Prince Charming is just one castle away,” she says. “And you’re gonna run across a field and meet each other in the middle, and have an amazing, perfect movie kiss. And it’s gonna be happily ever after.” \n\nDespite her love of a happy ending, the teen star says the flip side can be more appealing. \n\n“For some reason, I could never, ever stop writing songs about heartbreak,” she says. “Just because as human beings, what we can’t have is what we replay in our head over and over again before we go to sleep.”\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20090320035535/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20265855,00.html",

I have been extremely impressed with her, especially with her songwriting. I think she does magnificent work. She seems such a likeable little person, but I don’t know her. But I love watching her. My husband gets a kick out of her. He just loves watching her. He thinks she’s great. But I’m real impressed with the depth of her sometimes. I’ll tell you someone else that’s great like that — little Miley Cyrus. Miley is such a great songwriter — a lot of surprises about her that people don’t know yet. She’s still just Hannah Montana to a lot of people, but I think that she could have a very big career as a singer-songwriter even when she gets past the Hannah Montana days.",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] SHE WON'T RUN FROM A BROKEN HEART (BUT HER EXES MIGHT WANT TO TAKE COVER.)\nby Holly Corbett, photographs by Kenneth Willardi\n\nTaylor's story could be straight from a fairy tale. A sweet, talented girl from a small town in Pennsylvania gets discovered and is anointed the Princess of Pop Country almost overnight Then, when she joins the Jonas Brothers on tour, she meets her Prince Charming-aka Joe Jonas. They travel across the country to see one another, appear in the front row of each other's concerts, and attend MTV VMAs together. But one fall afternoon, she gets a 27-second phone call from him saying it's over. Only the story doesn't end there this is where it starts to get really good.\nAfter Taylor got out her frustration by making fun of Joe in a video on her MySpace page, the 19-year-old turned those tough love lessons into good advice and great songs. Every single track on her latest number one album, Fearless, is based on a personal experience. And then Taylor proceeded to take over the world. She designed a line of sundresses for Lei, which are available at Wal-Mart, performed at the World Series and at the Grammys, had a guest- starring role on CSI; and set a new music record-her song \"Love Story\" is the first country song ever to reach number one on the Top 40 pop chart. And as the ultimate proof that she's a major star, she's preparing for her first headlining tour: She'll be responsible for filling tens of thousands of seats in stadiums across the country. But at the end of the day, even the world's biggest star really just wants a little giri talk. She opened up to Seventeen about why she's a hopeless romantic, and what she's truly learned from heartbreak.\n\n17: What's your favorite thing to write songs about?\nTaylor Swift: Right now, my favorite thing to write about is love. And breakups. And boys. And feelings. Honesty is a big part of my writing, because when I was younger and fell in love with songs I'd hear, I would always wonder who that song was about. It would have totally broken my heart to know it wasn't about anyone and was just written so it could be on the radio.\n17: You wrote \"Forever & Always about your breakup with Joe Jonas. Do you regret putting those emotions out there?\nTS: Writing songs about people is the only way I know how to do things. I mean. I can't wish I hadn't written a song about someone, because if I hadn't, that song wouldn't exist. I just don't find any joy in writing about things I haven't been through.\n17: But why do you focus on the difficut stuff!\nTS: The hardest thing about heartbreak is feeling like you're alone, and that the other person doesn't really care. But when you hear a song about it, you realize you're not alone-because the person who wrote it went through the same thing. That's why songs about heartbreak are so relatable. When you miss somebody and you bear a happy song, it just makes you mad.\n17: Isn's getting mad part of the breakup process?\nTS: I think getting mad is always your first reaction when something hurts. And you shouldn't feel bad about that. Every person you date is different and makes you feel differently. Sometimes you can shake it off and you're fine-and then with another person it can really affect you. It's the unpredictability of love that really scares us, but it's also what draws us to it.\n17: So how do you let go and move o\nTS: I think that you never fully let go of everything And that should be your goal, because you can take away something good from everything that happens to you.\n17: What is your biggest fear in life?\nTS: Being accused of a crime I didn't commit. [Laughs.] I have nightmares about it. In the dream, I don't even know what I'm being accused of, but the police are coming after me with handcuffs while my mom is crying and asking where she went wrong. I'm screaming \"I didn't do it!\" but no one can hear me. It's my only recurring dream, and it freaks me out.\n17: That is freaky! Bo you have a close group of girtfriends that you always rely on to get you through a hard time?\nTS: In Nashville, it's Abigail (who's mentioned in Taylor's song \"Fifteen\"), and Kellie Pickler. In L.A. Selena Gomez is one of my best friends. I'm also really close with Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, and Emma Stone.\n17: What kind of stuff do you guys talk about?\nTS: Talking to my friends about their dating lives is my number ane hobby. Which is really ironic, because when I go to them and ask, \"What should I do?\" they're like, \"I don't know!\" And I'm like, \"When you and your boyfriend were fighting, I talked to you for two hours and told you all those things! Remember?!?\"\n17: What's your best piece of love advice?\nTS. I tell my friends who are dating guys who are playing games to play games too. You shouldn't start out playing games, but if he doesn't call you for two days, just \"forget to call him for two days. You just didn't have time to call because he didn't have time to think about your feelings. You have to outplay the player.\n17: Are you good at telling the difference between a good guy and a bad one?\nTS: Bad boys know how to keep the chase going through the entire relationship, and you never know if you completely have them or not. But the worst is when you think you finally went for the nice guy, and he breaks your heart! It's like, What gives?\n17: What would you say is your biggest love \"don't\"\nTS: No one wants to be with someone whe desperately needs them. You should want the other person and love him, but you shouldn't need him. If you depend on him for your happiness, that's not good, because what will you do when it ends?\n17: What's the secret to a good relationship?\nTS: Here's my theory: If you end up lasting with someone for years and years, eventually you'll run out of things to talk about or find out about each other. So you'd better pick a person who can make you laugh about nothing, or who can pull conversations out of the air.\n17: Are you dating anyone Hight now?\nTS: No, I'm perpetually single. If I meet someone who is really great. I'll date him. But I've had those friends who have to have a boyfriend all the time, and as soon asit doesn't work out with one, they jump to another one within 24 hours. What would happen if you were stuck in a relationship with someone who wasn't right for you, just because you were lonely and then missed meeting Mr. Right? Being alone is not the same as being lonely.\n17 What do you mean?\nTS: When you're alone, you're going to have lonely moments, but it's important to be happy with yourself. Sure, you'll always feel a little weird being alone on Valentine's Day, but you can't let that force you into a relationship with a guy you're not supposed to be with\n17: So what do you do when you're alone?\nTS: I like to do things that glorify being alone. I buy a candle that smells pretty, turn down the lights, and make a playlist of low-key songs. If you don't act like you've been hit by the plague when you're alone on Friday night, and just see it as a chance to have fun by yourself, It's not a bad day.\n17: What traits do you look for in a guy?\nTS: It would be unfair to have a general rule for every guy because they're all individual stories, not just chapters in one big book. But the guy I'm looking for is the guy 1 can be me around, not a version of me I think he'd like. He's the guy I'm not wearing different clothes for. I'm not holding back jokes because he might think they're stupid. I'm not afraid to show emotion because I might. scare him. It's important to not have rules about who the guy is. The rule should be about who you are when you're with him.\n17. How do you think you find that guy?\nTE: You can't predict who you'll fall in love with. Love's the one thing that doesn't have a pattern-it's a total mystery. If you overthink it, you're wasting your time.\n17: Can real-life love be as good as a fairy tale?\nTS: I have to believe in fairy tales, and I have to believe in love-but not blindly. If you do meet Prince Charming. know he is going to have his good days and his bad days He is going to have days when his hair looks horrible, and days when he's moody and says something that hurts your feelings. You have to base your fairy tale not upon happily mer after, but on happy right now.\n\nTAYLOR'S WISH LIST\nIN HIGH SCHOOL, TAYLOR MADE A TO-DO LIST THAT INCLUDED BEING ON THE COVER OF SEVENTEEN AND WINNING A CMA AWARD (DONE AND DONE!) WILL THESE WISHES FOR THE FUTURE COME TRUE?\nwin a grammy\nhave a successful headlining tour (HER FIRST ONE KICKS OFF APRIL 23rd!)\nbe on oprah\nhave a house with hardwood floors, like Selena\ngo to a wedding (SHE'S NEVER BEEN TO ONE)",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Official Transcript] On tour with Taylor Swift\nShe's self-made, driven, and wildly successful. Dateline got up close with 19-year-old Taylor Swift, the chart-topping country pop star. Read the transcript here.\n\nJune 1, 2009, 12:24 AM GMT+2 / Source: Dateline NBC\n\nBy Hoda Kotb\nTaylor Swift: You've heard her name. Now you'll see her up close and personal. The 19-year-old singing sensation sold more albums last year than Madonna, Miley Cyrus or The Jonas Brothers, becoming both pop's top seller, and country's hottest act.\n\nDateline is about to take you on tour with Taylor Swift, giving you an all access pass into this young star's life.\n\nYou will see private home videos, never before-seen photos. We will even take you inside her bedroom. From behind the scenes at her rehearsals, to backstage on the opening night of the sold-out tour, we are with Taylor every step of the way.\n\nWe first meet up with the star in Houston, Texas.  Her tour is still in the planning stages and rehearsals have yet to start -- but tonight, she'll perform at the Houston Rodeo for a crowd of more than 70,000.\n\nMarch 20, 2009\n\nTaylor Swift: This is the most giant room that I've ever played in. \n\nGrant, bandmate: It's gonna be loud.\n\nTaylor Swift: This is actually happening right now. Wow. I've never seen that many people ever in one place. Just knowing that they all had ticket stubs in their pocket that said my name on them was the craziest feeling.\n\nIt's crazy alright. Even though the launch of her tour in Evansville, Indiana is still more than a month away, all 52 of her shows are sold out.\n\nHoda Kotb: Did you freak about how quickly they sold out?\n\nTaylor Swift: I get a call that says, hey, guess what?  You sold the Staples Center out in two minutes.\n\nHoda Kotb: Can you believe it?\n\nTaylor Swift: Are you kidding?\n\nLouie Messina, tour promoter: It's been amazing. Madison Square Garden sells out in one minute. The Staples Center in Los Angeles in 2 minutes. Even just little towns - Lafayette, Louisiana, Greensboro, Arkansas- all 3, 5, 7 minutes sell-outs. Throughout my whole career, I've never seen anything like this. I said this to her as Bruce Springsteen was the voice of his generation, Taylor is the voice of her generation.\n\nStill, headlining a major tour could be a huge gamble. Can a 19-year-old really pull it all off?\n\nScott Borchetta, President & Ceo, Big Machine Records: You have to be careful in this moment.  You're never bigger than the game.  The minute you think you're bigger than the game is the minute that you start to lose the game.\n\nBut Taylor Swift doesn't seem interested in the game. Even as her music races up the charts, she remains remarkably level-headed.\n\nTaylor Swift: I'm never gonna feel like I'm on top of it, and at the height of what I know how to do. I don't think what demographic this is going to hit, or what format of radio is going to play this, I just write the song for the person that I'm writing the song to.\n\nThat's right. Unlike a lot of music's biggest idols, Taylor sings about her life, in songs that she writes. Maybe that's why her fans relate to her so well.\n\nCrying fan: I'm really laughing right now. I'm just so emotional. OK, I'm so sorry.\n\nTaylor Swift: Thank you so much.\n\nCrying fan: You mean the world to me.\n\nOr maybe it's because at heart she is still every bit a teenager...\n\nTaylor Swift: I don't want to lose you slowly, Hanson! I've had an unwavering love for Hanson since I was 8. I thought I was gonna marry Taylor Hanson because we have the same name.\n\nBut how many teenagers headline major tours? And how many call the shots on all the performance details, right down to set design and musical melodies? For her tour, Taylor Swift is handling all of that herself.\n\nTaylor Swift: Let's just see what it feels like to drop it out completely. I want it to be a three part harmony. Perfect, you guys.\n\nWith 29 days to go until kick-off night in Evansville, Dateline gets an exclusive look inside Taylor's open-call audition for back-up dancers.\n\nMarch 25, 2009, Nashville, Tenn.\n\nTaylor Swift: It's really hard to pick dancers because they're all so good. They all have these really special qualities about them, but we have it down to a group.\n\nAnd with 6 dancers selected, it is finally time to rehearse.\n\nTaylor Swift: I'm, like, shaking, I'm so excited.\n\nAs she rehearses for her big tour kick-off in Evansville, Indiana, Taylor Swift sings about change -- something that has become very familiar to this young teen and her proud parents, Scott and Andrea, since she first burst on to the music scene three years ago.\n\nApril 2, 2009, Los Angeles, Calf.\n\nTaylor is just one week into rehearsals when she breaks for a blitz of pre-tour promotion. Dateline gets a peek inside it all.\n\nThere's a photo shoot for tour sponsor LEI jeans, and interviews with Access Hollywood, and The Tonight Show.  Then it is time to glam it up and zip over to the red carpet premiere of \"Hannah Montana: The Movie\"...\n\nPaula: The red carpet closes at 6:30 and we have 30 minutes of travel.\n\nTaylor Swift: We need to go.\n\nPaula: So we need to move.\n\nTaylor Swift: Thanks, you guys! OK, when we get off the stairs we need to bolt. We need to literally gallop. Ooh, it's a conscious effort to inhale & exhale. I'm going to completely need to undo this dress.\n\nPaula: It's that bad, huh?\n\nTaylor Swift: Nah, I'll be fine. I'm being dramatic. (looking at phone) Late to the Hannah Montana premiere.\n\nPaula: Are you tweeting?\n\nTaylor Swift: Yes, I am.\n\nOff cam: What's your Twitter?\n\nTaylor Swift: It's @taylorswift13.\n\nTaylor swift 13 is Taylor's personal twitter. The viral star has some 500,000 followers on twitter and more than a million friends on her MySpace blog.\n\nTaylor Swift: I am shopping for bikinis online for the summer because I can't really go shopping anymore because I don't have time (laughs) so I just wrote a novel of a blog and then posted it. It's really hitting me that I get to go on my first headlining tour. With a big stage. There are a bunch of new people you're going to see with us this year. First of all, we have six new dancers who can point their toes and twirl and stuff with the best of them.\n\nIn the midst of tour preps, Taylor takes Dateline inside her top secret rehearsal space - hidden inside a warehouse near her home in Nashville -  for an exclusive preview of how the show is coming together.\n\nTaylor Swift: Call for band and dancers to the stage, curtain will come and lock you out in about 5 seconds.\n\nTaylor's mom, Andrea, is still dazed by her daughter's remarkable talent.\n\nAndrea Swift: Honestly, the musical end of it, not one bone in my body. My mother was an opera singer so it completely skipped a generation and jumped over me, landed right on Taylor. I still sometimes see that little two-year-old in the backseat in the car seat.\n\nIf the pipes you hear in these private home movies are a natural gift, Taylor's drive and her fierce determination stun everyone. At the tender age of 11, she convinced her mom to take her on a trip from their home in Pennsylvania to Nashville's famed music row.\n\nTaylor Swift: I was just dead set on Nashville ever since I saw a TV special about Faith Hill, and it said that she went to Nashville.\n\nSo, with this demo CD in hand, the little girl with big dreams began knocking on some of country music’s biggest doors.\n\nTaylor Swift: My mom and my little brother all went to Nashville and-- drove up and down Music Row. My mom would stop in front of a record label.  And I'd run in and--\n\nHoda Kotb: No, you did not.\n\nTaylor Swift: --hand them my CD, to the receptionist.  And I'd be like, hi.  I'm Taylor.  I want a record deal.  Call me.\n\nHoda Kotb: (laughter) Oh, God.  How'd that go over?\n\nTaylor Swift: It was sort of like, aw, little girl.\n\nHoda Kotb: Ain't she sweet?\n\nHoda Kotb: Did you hear back from anybody?\n\nTaylor Swift: I think I got a call from someone and they were like, just wanted to let you know we got your CD, and we wanted to say keep trying. That's when I learned how to play guitar.  And I started writing my own songs. I would find time to write either in class (laugh), which-- you know, when the teachers would conduct random notebook checks, (laugh) you can imagine their surprise when it's algebra on this side of the page and (sings) \"Drew looks at me\" (laugh) on the other side of the page. \n\nThose same sweet, heartfelt lyrics we see Taylor singing during rehearsals are what first got noticed by RCA records -the label behind famous names Like Cristina Aguilera, Kelly Clarkson and Dave Matthews.  Taylor was only 14.\n\nTaylor Swift: I played them a few songs.  And they said that they wanted to sign me to a development deal. A development deal is an in-between record deal.  It's like, a guy saying that he wants to date you but not be your boyfriend.  (laugh) You know, they don't wanna sign you to an actual record deal or put an album out on you.  They wanna watch your progress for a year.\n\nBut at the end of that year, a major letdown. RCA took a pass on Taylor.\n\nTaylor Swift: They wanted to shelf me.\n\nHoda Kotb: OK, that's a bummer.\n\nTaylor Swift: --keep me in development till I was probably about 18. So I walked away from the biggest record label in Nashville.\n\nBy then, Taylor had convinced her family to move to Nashville, where she kept writing songs and playing wherever she could, still hoping for that one lucky break.\n\nTaylor Swift: I had this-- this big showcase at the Bluebird Café. And all of these record labels showed up. And at the end, this guy named Scott Borchetta came up to me.\n\nScott Borchetta: I remember sitting there just kind of--(closes his eyes) just - is this gonna hit me? And it absolutely did. And so I went and met with the family after that. \n\nTaylor Swift: He said, \"I have good news and I have bad news.\"Scott Borchetta worked at Universal Records.  And so, he goes, \"The good news is that I wanna sign you to a record deal. The bad news is that I'm no longer with Universal records.\"\n\nHoda Kotb: Oh no.\n\nTaylor Swift: He then explained to me that he wanted to start up his own brand new record label.  And that he didn't have a name for it.  He didn't have a building for it.  And he didn't have a staff for it.  But he had a dream, and would I go on board? I went with my gut instinct which-- which just said, say yes. \n\nHoda Kotb: That was a giant leap of faith, wasn't it?\n\nTaylor Swift: There are a million ways it could've gone wrong, (laugh) yeah.\n\nBorchetta called his little record label “Big Machine.”And within no time, the neophyte record president and his ingénue were on the fast track to music fame.\n\nScott Borchetta: I think it was in August of 2005, Taylor played me a song called “When You Think Tim McGraw.”  She finished the song and I said, \"Do you realize what you just have written?  Do you have any idea?\" That was that moment of, \"Oh my God.\"  And the grenade dropped in the still pond. \n\nJust three years later, Taylor's record sales have topped 7 million.\n\nAndrea Swift: We're leaving for rehearsals.\n\nTaylor Swift: Full day of rehearsals! Didn't know that we were filming? Right now.\n\nAndrea Swift: Let's go!\n\nApril 5\n\nIt's less than three weeks until her tour kicks off and Taylor Swift is walking into dress rehearsals, but this time it's for The Academy Of Country Music Awards, where she's nominated for three awards, including  album of the year. And she is ecstatic.\n\nAnd the winner for album of the year... Taylor Swift: “Fearless.”\n\nTaylor Swift: I freaked out. In this room, we have a person who has written songs with me since I was 14 years old and it was no profit to you because I didn't have a record deal and people thought you were crazy, but you... We have Scott Borchetta, who signed us to the record deal, who lets me write my own songs… And the fans aren't here but thanks to them and everyone else in this room, I love you guys so much.  We just won album of the year!\n\n@taylorswift13: still smiling about the acms. back to nashville for rehearsals...\n\nWhat a rush for a girl who was discovered just a few years ago. And look where she is now.\n\n13 days till tour kick-off\n\nTaylor Swift: Just arrived at rehearsals. I'm about to go do Pilates and I'm going to do that with the whole band and then we have rehearsals all day... This tour is my baby. I'm just so excited about every angle from seeing that stage go from a drawing that I drew to seeing it 20 feet in the air--\n\nYup, that's right. Taylor Swift designed this elaborate stage herself, complete with a hidden elevator, collapsible turrets, and, quick change rooms for her 8 costume changes.\n\nHoda Kotb: This is the secret changing room?\n\nTaylor Swift: During the actual show, there will be racks and racks and racks.\n\nHoda Kotb: so you see it all in your mind?\n\nTaylor Swift: Yeah, I just spend all my time organizing it in my head. It's just so much fun for me to think of the song the way people think of it on the record and turn it into a completely different thing for the live show.\n\nHoda Kotb: Cool effects?\n\nTaylor Swift: Well, the cool thing about this stage is that it's a giant projector screen. The stage is different for every single song.\n\nIf there's any doubt that a teenager can lead a major tour, Taylor puts all naysayers to shame.  From business decisions, to animated projections, to chord progressions, this 19-year-old is in charge of every aspect of her tour.\n\nAndrea Swift: Every single decision that's made, whether it's talking about artwork that's gonna go on the side of the buses for the tour or a script that needs to be read, you know, almost invariably, someone in the room says, \"Have you checked with Taylor?\"\n\nApril 10, Nashville, Tenn.\n\nJen: When do you want her at rehearsals?\n\nTaylor Swift: At least a day ahead of time. So she knows her queues. She's coming up on a lift and she needs to know when...\n\nHoda Kotb: Is it hard to make your vision come out exactly the way you want it?\n\nTaylor Swift: There are times when you get frustrated, but the one thing you always focus on is treating people well. You just cannot storm off and freak out. People don't take you seriously if you scream, if you raise your voice, especially when you're a 19-year-old girl.\n\nTaylor's band is made up of all types of musicians - among them a hard rock lover, a fiddler and a banjo player. While their musical tastes may differ, they all agree on one thing:\n\nCaitlin Evanson, fiddler: Taylor's a 40-year old in a 19-year old's body. She's made and meant to be doing what she's doing. She knows how to lead the room and lead the stage. And she knows how to do it too without being some task master.\n\nTaylor Swift: I don't know about that, maybe between the first one and the second one. I think more kickdrum related. More the kick rather than the cymbal.\n\nAt times she may look frustrated -- but Taylor's strive for perfection only makes the people who work with this young star respect her that much more.\n\nPaul Sudoti, guitarist: There's been times where I've played a solo, and then she'll say \"Well, can you kind of do this\" and she'll sing me a melody and I'll incorporate that and that's very impressive for someone her age.\n\nTaylor Swift: The problem that I was having with the solo is that it's like its getting a little noodley, like its (sound). I'd rather it be like ner-ner-ner-ner-ner. less, less notes.  That would be great. Let's try it again.\n\nPaul Sudoti: That was totally along the right lines. \n\nTaylor Swift: Awesome, y'all wanna break for lunch? \n\nOne minute she's the woman in charge, the next, just a regular kid.\n\nTaylor Swift: So today, I spent the first half of my day at rehearsals and then the next half of my day is gonna be spent at this Elle photo shoot.\n\nTaylor Swift may look the part of a Hollywood princess, but she doesn't act like it. Here she is at a grocery store posing for a magazine shoot.\n\nTaylor Swift: I'm going to be posing in a couture dress in a grocery aisle because they said pick where you spend a lot of time and where you're most comfortable and I really love grocery stores.\n\nHoda Kotb: You get a lot of press for being the good girl. You're not in the tabloids.  You're not drunk, stumbling down on the ground.  You're not flashing, you know, your business all over the place.  And that, somehow, makes you unique.  Do you find that odd, that's the unique thing among 19-year-olds?\n\nTaylor Swift: I have always felt a little strange about it being so unique that I'm not a train wreck. Like, this weird fluke that I'm not-- partying all the time and, you know, drunk in this interview.\n\nHoda Kotb: Have you ever smoked a cigarette?\n\nTaylor Swift: No.\n\nHoda Kotb: Ever had a glass of alcohol?\n\nTaylor Swift: No (laughs).\n\nHoda Kotb: Do you ever think about, like, \"I wonder what that tastes like?\" \n\nTaylor Swift: I'm just not very interested. People talk to me a lot about, \"Why don't you ever rebel?\"  And I feel like I do rebel. To me, rebelling is-- is that rush you get when you sing a song about someone and you know they're in the crowd.  Like, that's a really fun rebellion for me.\n\nMusic: Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving, but I know I saw a light in you...\n\nTaylor Swift: Honesty is a big theme for me.  And sugar coating isn't really my style.\n\nHoda Kotb: Mm-hmm.\n\nTaylor Swift: If something happens to me, you're going to hear about it. I only know how to write songs about my life.\n\nThe song \"Forever And Always\" is an emotional beat in Taylor's personal story, detailing her highly publicized breakup with teen heartthrob Joe Jonas, a painful episode in her life that she opened up to Ellen Degeneres about last fall.\n\nTaylor Swift: I'm not even going to be able to remember the boy who broke up with me over the phone in 25 seconds when I was 18.\n\nShe's much more tight-lipped about it now.\n\nHoda Kotb: I'll just name some people/ We'll just play a word game. Zach Effron.\n\nRecommended\n\ndateline\nNew video shows car resembling Bryan Kohberger's driving around the time of Idaho student murders\n\ndateline\nWatch the Dateline episode “Murder in Minot” now\nTaylor Swift: Amazing guy.  All around amazing guy.\n\nHoda Kotb: Okay.  Justin Timberlake.\n\nTaylor Swift: (gasp) I love Justin Timberlake.  (laugh) He's so nice.\n\nHoda Kotb: Joe Jonas.\n\nTaylor Swift: We have to do that one?\n\nHoda Kotb: If you want to. \n\nTaylor Swift: How 'bout, that was last year, this is this year.\n\nHoda Kotb: You do write about things that-- that are authentic. The whole Joe Jonas thing.  Putting that thing on paper, did that just flow right outta you? \n\nTaylor Swift: I write songs about what I go through.\n\nHoda Kotb: Yeah.\n\nTaylor Swift: it's just like any other song that I've written.  It's about a person.  And-- that person then becomes a character in a song.\n\nMock interview:\n\nHoda Kotb: I'm sitting down with Taylor Swift.\n\nEven I became part of the show when Taylor asked me to tape a mock interview to use for her tour.\n\nMock interview:\n\nTaylor Swift: I'm so excited.\n\nTaylor Swift: It starts out with Hoda and I in these maroon chairs and what we'll do is we'll have the video play and then on the stage when the video stops playing we'll have one of my backup dancers recreate her hair and her outfit and be sitting with her back to the audience. Like the whole song. I'm doing an interview and basically the song is like, I have a meltdown in an interview.\n\nMock interview:\n\nHoda Kotb: I heard that when you write songs you include the names of the actual guys you've dated.\n\nTaylor Swift: Yeah, I do.\n\nHoda Kotb: If you are naming the guys you dated in your songs, why do you think any guys going to want to date you?\n\nTaylor Swift: I guess that in that situation, I just figure if guys don't want me to write bad songs about them they shouldn't do bad things.\n\nMusic: “Forever And Always:”\n\nWas I out of line, did I say something way too honest\n\nmade you run and hide, like a scared little boy.\n\nI looked into your eyes\n\nHoda Kotb: There's so much emotion in the whole thing/\n\nTaylor Swift: Oh yeah, that's an emotional one.\n\nHoda Kotb: When you're in the front, right?! And the whole chair throwing, I'm into the whole thing. I'm into the whole stammering, stumbling...\n\nTaylor Swift: It's like you're my therapist. It's awesome. You get to feel a lot during that song.\n\nTaylor is definitely not shy about sharing her feelings. Her songs are melodic versions of her diary. No topic off limits, no emotion too raw, no relationship too private.  She writes about her lowest lows...\n\n“You're not sorry”\n\nyou don't have to call, anymore\n\nI won't pick up the phone\n\nthis is the last straw\n\ndon't wanna hurt anymore\n\nAnd her best days...\n\n“The best day”\n\nI love you for giving me your eyes\n\nstaying back and watching me shine and I didn't know if you knew\n\nSo I'm taking this chance to say\n\nThat I had the best day with you today\n\nAndrea Swift: The first time that she played The Best Day for me-- was Christmas Eve. She had made this edited music video. I'm looking on the TV and this video comes up with this voice that sounds exactly like Taylor's.   And I looked over at her and she said, \"I wrote it for you, Mom.\"  And that's when I lost it.  And-- and I've lost it pretty much every time I've heard that song since.\n\nHoda Kotb: You and your mom have a very cool relationship.\n\nTaylor Swift: It's a different kind of friendship than the cool mom who tries to party with her daughter. She's my best friend. And we're definitely never gonna go clubbing together.\n\nClubbing is not Taylor's style, period. In fact, she still lives with her parents and younger brother Austin in this Nashville house,  and she still writes songs right here in her bedroom. And when we got a tour of Taylor's house, we also got some inside info on some of her secret quirks.\n\nTaylor Swift: I like organizing things.  I like organizing my closets, so that I know where everything is.  And-- and I used to color code it.  You know-- (laughter)--\n\nHoda Kotb: You did? You really col-- color coded your closet?\n\nTaylor Swift: Yeah, I-- I used to do that.\n\nHoda Kotb: You're \"that girl.\"\n\nTaylor Swift: I was \"that girl.\"  I don't really color code any more.\n\nWith only weeks to go before her big tour kick-off, who has time for that?\n\nTaylor Swift: Ready to go on tour? Ready!\n\nOff cam: What are we doing right now?\n\nTaylor Swift: We're here. We're about to leave. We're about to go on tourrrrrrrr!\n\nTaylor Swift dubbed her debut tour “Fearless” -  just like her bestselling album.  With 52 shows squeezed into a hectic 6-month schedule, taylor and co. Will be criss-crossing the country through o=October.\n\nHoda Kotb: It is bizarre to know that this is all yours? Do you feel ready?\n\nTaylor Swift: I'm ready.\n\nApril 14, 2008, Nashville, Tenn.\n\nBut even while she's knee deep in rehearsals, Taylor still has other performances to think about. Tonight, it's a set at the Grand Ol' Opry - country music's most famous stage.\n\n@taylorswift13: playing at the grand ol' opry tonight\n\nJust before Taylor's tour finally kicks off, we get a sneak peek inside what is about to become her home away from home.\n\nTaylor Swift: This is my lucky number 13 and I put it on the door because I touch it every night before I go on stage.\n\nHoda Kotb: Alright.  What do we have here?\n\nTaylor Swift: The girliest bus ever.\n\nHoda Kotb: No kidding!  Did you design the whole deal?\n\nTaylor Swift: Yeah, completely. It was while I was making my second album so while I would leave the studio I would go over to the bus place and help them design it.  It has a fireplace.\n\nHoda Kotb: OK. This is crazy. I love it! So who's gonna ride with you here on this bus?\n\nTaylor Swift: My mom rides with me on this bus. The first two years I was on a bus with my band and crew and it was really crowded and, ya know, thanks to how great this year's been we've been able to expand it and have a little space.\n\nHoda Kotb: Show me the rest of it.\n\nTaylor Swift: This is my room.  Check it out.\n\nHoda Kotb: I gotta get in here.  Oh, how cool is this!\n\nTaylor Swift: I'm so excited ‘cause I've never had a TV in my room before until I got this bus.\n\nHoda Kotb: You are kidding. It must be weird to realize the impact that you're having on people you don't know?\n\nTaylor Swift: Yesterday in my little hometown of Hendersonville, Tennessee, when I'm in Cracker Barrel and this adorable couple comes up and is like, \"Will you please hold our baby?\" and they gave me their little five-month-old baby and I was like, \"Sure, do you have a camera?\" And they were like, \"No, we just wanted to tell her some day that you held her.\"\n\nHoda Kotb: It's got to be a little overwhelming sometimes, huh?\n\nTaylor Swift: In the best way possible though.\n\n@taylorswift13: On the bus to Indiana...Ahh, back to the good old days..\n\nA few days later, that bus pulls up in Evansville, Indiana.\n\nAndrea Swift: So this is the first stop on the tour.\n\nTaylor Swift: This is insane. This is the first stop on the tour.\n\nKatelyn: Let's read a story. Ready? I'll start chapter one.\n\nTaylor Swift: Once upon a time…\n\nKatelyn: Once upon a time, there was Evansville, Indiana...\n\nIt's finally here. The day of her “Fearless” tour kick-off, and Taylor is filled with anticipation. If she can pull it off, all her planning and execution will culminate tonight. Dateline is backstage with Taylor in her vibe room - a cozy hang-out that is set up at every show.\n\nTaylor Swift: I can't believe this is actually happening today, we've been rehearsing in a warehouse for three weeks now and, and it’s like, there's actually going to be a crowd.\n\nEmily: All there for you!\n\nAll there for her. Yet Taylor shows no signs of nerves - perfectly relaxed, confident that everything will go off without a hitch.\n\nTaylor Swift: I'm signing a bunch of different things for the venue. I never get tired of signing autographs ‘cause I used to do it so much in class dreaming about the day that it might mean something to somebody. Also, I can do it with my eyes closed. Watch!\n\nOff camera: Fire marshal is coming! Oh my gosh! Fire marshal. Fire marshal is coming.\n\nTaylor Swift: I just got wax in my eyeball, I just got wax in my eyeball! I'm burning, I'm burning ‘cause there is wax in my eye!\n\nUh-oh, only four hours left till show time.\n\nIt is just four hours before Taylor Swift is due to hit the stage in Evansville, Indiana for the big kick-off of her Fearless tour, and she is in a panic.\n\nTaylor Swift: I'm burning ‘cause there is wax in my eye!\n\nBut moments later, she's back, crisis averted.\n\nTaylor Swift: Hey, did you see me get attacked by the candle?\n\nCandle frenzy aside, the mood is so low-key backstage, it feels more like a slumber party then the evening of a major tour kickoff.\n\nTaylor Swift: Amazing, Amazing.\n\nAnd Taylor is positively normal.\n\nTaylor Swift: OMG. OMG. Mac sent us all this body paint.  Alright, it's now 4'o'clock. We're about  three hours from my first show on my headline tour and I'm so excited. Um, this is actually happening and I can't wait.\n\nThen at 7 o'clock, it's time: the 52-show “Fearless” tour is under way. Taylor gathers the group for one last pep-talk.\n\nTaylor Swift: You guys are my brothers and my sisters, and I just want to thank you for that. And I couldn't, I couldn't love you more. And we're going to go out and there and be fearless. What are we going to be?\n\nGroup: Fearless!\n\nTaylor Swift: When I hear that high-pitched sound of all those people screaming together, it's like, I want to get on stage right now. It's the most amazing feeling. It's one of the craziest feelings to be on stage and know that you were sitting on your bedroom floor when that song came to be and now there's an arena full of people singing it.\n\nAndrea Swift: What an amazing show, OMG! So proud of you honey. So good. I wish you could have seen the expressions of people’s faces when they saw the water coming down.\n\nTaylor Swift: Where they like what?\n\nAndrea Swift: It was like, \"Oh, no, she didn't!!\"\n\nTaylor Swift: Is that what they were saying? (laughs)\n\nAndrea Swift: Yeah.\n\nTaylor Swift: The crowd was freakin’ crazy.\n\nShe has pulled it off. Her first show is a smash. But incredibly, she is still tweaking, still perfecting.\n\nTaylor Swift: I still have a bunch of notes for lighting and stuff. I have a lot of notes for lighting and stuff.\n\nAfter all, there are 51 more shows to go.\n\nTaylor Swift: My favorite on-the-road pit stop? Subway or Jimmy John's sandwiches. Aw, I want a sandwich right now.\n\nTaylor Swift: I am in, um, can you help me out with that?\n\nAndrea Swift: In Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nTaylor Swift: Exactly.\n\nTaylor Swift: We started out the day in Kansas and then we flew to Virginia. Then we got another plane and we're going to Chicago. And then tomorrow, we fly back to Nashville. Then the next day, we fly to South Carolina, then Jacksonville, then Biloxi, then London. Say that four times fast!\n\nTaylor Swift: We are almost in London. We're about to land. London is awesome.\n\n@taylorswift13: About to play Charleston, SC. ...Crazy\n\n@taylorswift13: post-beach, pre-show nap. Biloxi Mississippi!\n\n@taylorswift13: About to play Charleston, SC....\n\n@taylorswift13: The plane jerked up in the air, then back down...Hi Spokane.\n\n@taylorswift13: Sitting in my dressing room at Staples Center in LA (EEEEE!!!).\n\n@taylorswift13: The car just arrived to take us to the airport. Taped to the seat in front of me is a sign: \"Taylor, don't forget your retainer. Dad\". Nice.\n\nTaylor Swift: I'm playing the Staples Center in LA. I wanted to have something special for the audience and so, enter John Mayer.\n\nThere's a whole lot more road time in store for Taylor. She's got dozens more shows to go. But that's OK; this 19-year-old has proved that she is indeed fearless.\n\nHoda Kotb: Close your eyes.  Ten years from now, you're 29.  How do you see-- what's-- what's happening in your life?\n\nTaylor Swift: I could have kids.  I could be married.  I could be single.  I could-- I could live in Nashville, or I could live in L.A., or I could live in the Bahamas.  I don't know.\n\nHoda Kotb: You got a lot of-- a lot of choices?\n\nTaylor Swift: If you would have told me four years ago that I'd be sitting here, you know, putting together this huge tour and winning album of the year, I wouldn't have believed you.  And to think ten years from now, that's such a long time.  And I'm just open to whatever it brings.",

      "Transcript/Content": "10 Questions for Taylor Swift\nThursday, Apr. 23, 2009\n\nHow long does it take you to write a song? Stacey Klemstein JOHNSBURG, ILL.\n\nMost of the time, songs that I write end up being finished in 30 minutes or less. \"Love Story\" I wrote on my bedroom floor in about 20 minutes. When I get on a roll with something, it's really hard for me to put it down unfinished.\n\nWhat's the story behind \"Love Story\"? Madison Parker PORTLAND, ORE.\n\n\"Love Story\" is actually about a guy that I almost dated. But when I introduced him to my family and my friends, they all said they didn't like him. All of them! For the first time, I could relate to that Romeo-and-Juliet situation where the only people who wanted them to be together were them. That's the most romantic song I've written, and it's not even about a person I really dated.\n\nHow do you manage to appear so genuinely happy when, according to your songs, you've suffered so much heartbreak? Amelia Walker, LONDON\n\nI have ways of channeling the heartbreak. Also, it's been a really awesome year. I get so excited when a song I wrote that's very personal to me goes No. 1 and I look down and see people singing the words back to me. That makes me so much happier than anything could ever bring me down.\n\nWho's your biggest musical influence? Morgan Phelps LEICESTER, ENGLAND\n\nShania Twain. She came out, and she was just so strong and so independent and wrote all her own songs. That meant so much to me, even as a 10-year-old. Just knowing that the stories she was telling in those songs--those were her stories.\n\nI grew up listening to heavy metal and rock, yet I find your songs really catchy. What sort of music do you listen to? Vinaya Lal Shrestha KATHMANDU, NEPAL\n\nI've always loved Def Leppard, ever since I was little. I got to do a TV concert called CMT Crossroads with them, where they pair up a country artist with legends in rock 'n' roll. I was singing Def Leppard songs, and they were singing my songs. It was just a complete out-of-body experience.\n\nWhat advice do you have for aspiring songwriters? Milo Victor, MANILA\n\nWrite your songs not for a demographic or for getting on the radio. Write your songs for the person you're writing that song about. When I sit down, I say to myself, \"O.K., who is this about? What would I say to him right now if I could?\"\n\nYou have so many unrecorded covers floating around on YouTube. Do you think you'll ever make an album of just covers? Catherine Hearit KALAMAZOO, MICH.\n\nI don't think I'd ever make an album of just covers because I love writing my own music. In concert, I love doing pop covers like Beyoncé or Rihanna--things that people wouldn't expect. But I usually try to cycle them through every couple of months, because if I didn't write it, it's easier for me to get tired singing it live.\n\nDo you think you have influenced the younger generation to appreciate country more? Stefanie Yeung CHADDS FORD, PA.\n\nSo many girls come up and say to me, \"I have never listened to country music in my life. I didn't even know my town had a country-music station. Then I got your record, and now I'm obsessed.\" That's the coolest compliment to me.\n\nWhat other artists would you like to do a duet with? Earl S. Worthington, CHICAGO\n\nI would like to do a duet with Taylor Hanson, because I have loved Hanson since I was 8. And Taylor Hanson has an amazing voice. And also we're both named Taylor.\n\nDo you think it's right for people to pay so much attention to the personal lives of entertainers? Sara Makaretz YARMOUTH, MAINE\n\nI feel like people paying attention to your personal life when you're in this position is sort of a given. There's nothing that I can say to make it stop. I don't live in L.A. I live in Nashville. The paparazzi do not know where Nashville is, so I sort of have a normal life when I'm home.\n\n\n\nRead more: http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1893502,00.html#ixzz1ns5uw3Fe",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift's Stone Harbor\nFrom Coffee Talk gigs to Italian Garden pizza, it was a \"pretty magical place to grow up. \"\nby Robert Strauss, For The Inquirer, Posted: May 14, 2009\n\nFrom the time she was 2 until she was 14, when her family left for Nashville, Taylor Swift's parents had a summer house on the bay in Stone Harbor. Though all of 19 now, Swift has had quite a year. Her album, Fearless, spent 11 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard chart, and \"Love Story,\" its main single, was a rare crossover country/pop hit. She's been on magazine covers from Rolling Stone to Allure and seemingly every TV awards show possible.\n\nPreparing for her spring/summer Fearless tour a few weeks ago, Swift joined in a peppy e-mail exchange about her summer days at the Shore. She is scheduled to play the Wachovia Center on Aug. 1 and doesn't have another concert until six days later in Minnesota. Sounds like a surreptitious build-in for a chance to do some time at the 100th Street beach in Stone Harbor and maybe an opportunity to gossip while standing in line at Springer's ice cream.\n\nQuestion: Where did you go to the Shore as a kid?\n\nAnswer: I spent my summers at the Jersey Shore from the time I was 2 until we sold the house in Stone Harbor when I was 14. It was a pretty magical place to grow up.\n\nQ: I heard you did karaoke there as a kid. Where did you do that?\n\nA: I used to sing karaoke at Henny's [on Third Avenue] and play acoustic shows for hours on end at Coffee Talk, a little cafe on 98th Street. I used to drag my parents into those places all the time, and all of their friends would show up and put dollars in my tip jar. When I was younger, I used to play for hours and hours in cafes like that. When I would run out of material, I'd just start making up songs on the spot.\n\nQ: Do you have any songs that were inspired by the time you were at the Shore?\n\nA: There was a little demo I made when I was 11, and I think it's floating around the Internet. It's called \"Smoky Black Nights,\" and it's all about being at the Shore. Then there's the song \"Invisible,\" which is about the son of my parents' friends. They were always at my house and their son was my age, and he would always tell me about other girls he liked. I felt, well, invisible. Obviously. So I wrote that song about it, and it was a bonus track on my first album.\n\nQ: Everyone has rituals at the Shore. What were yours?\n\nA: It was really cool living on the bay, and we have so many stories about it. We used to all gather together on the dock when the boat parades would go by on July 4 and we'd shoot water balloons at them.\n\nI made a clubhouse in the room above my garage and made a filing system of members of the club. Everyone had a profile that I would write on tiles I found. I painted the whole room different colors and used to spend all day in there just doing nothing but sitting in my little club. Because it was mine.\n\nWe lived across from the bird sanctuary and I had a pair of binoculars, and some days I'd just stare at the window, looking for birds. Or the boy who lived next door to me, whom I swore I would marry someday. One summer when I was 11, I wrote a novel. I was allowed to be kind of weird and quirky and imaginative as a kid, and that was my favorite part of living at the Shore.\n\nQ: Do you have any favorite Shore food?\n\nA: My favorite Shore food was going to Italian Garden on 96th Street. That was my favorite place to eat. I loved the giant Caesar salads and the white pizza. I went back there the last time I was in New Jersey.\n\nQ: When was that time you were back?\n\nA: I went back to Stone Harbor two summers ago, when we were on tour with Brad Paisley. We had a day off, so I took my whole band back to my little summer town and we went out to one of the islands in the inlet and swam and tubed and went water-skiing. It was really cool seeing it all again, walking around and going to Springer's and Donna's. I kind of felt like I was 10 years old again. Except, this time a few more people knew me.\n\nQ: Speaking of Springer's, the ice-cream place on Third Avenue in Stone Harbor where everyone on the island seems to wait in line on a weekend night, what was your favorite flavor there?\n\nA: I loved the cookies 'n' cream they have there. And I've always been a huge cookie-dough fan. I remember when I was little, I used to walk in there and just stare up at all the flavors and toppings, completely frozen and unable to make a final decision. I was always so overwhelmed when I went in there. This question makes me really hungry, by the way.\n\nQ: Will you be playing Atlantic City any time soon, with another chance to come to the Shore?\n\nA: I'm sure we'll play there soon. I saw LeAnn Rimes in concert in Atlantic City when I was 8. She touched my hand. I bragged about it for a year.\n\nPosted: May 14, 2009 - 11:00 PM\nRobert Strauss, For The Inquirer",

We asked the 35-year-old Rich if he had to think back to his adolesence when finding common ground to write about with the 19-year-old star.\n\n\"Sure there's an age difference,\" Rich told The Boot. \"But she knows herself and her audience very well, and she's so connected to who that audience is. She knows she's still a kid and embraces it. She writes things that are important to her. If she breaks up with a boyfriend, that's traumatic to her, and she'll write about it. Just like if I'm pissed off at the news, I'll write 'Shuttin' Detroit Down.' But we respect that about each other.\"\n\nRich has written with some of the heaviest hitters in Nashville's songwriting community and calls Swift \"one of my favorites.\" But he's yet to write with his ultimate country idol.\n\n\"I want to write and record and album with Garth Brooks,\" he told us. \"If Garth would ever allow me to record him, to write a couple of songs and just stomp a hole through the floor in the studio with him, that would be a really big deal to me.

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: the 19-year-old country music star conquering America - and now Britain\nHow did a wholesome, Dolly Parton-loving teenager become America's biggest-selling artist in a decade? Ahead of Taylor Swift's UK concerts, we travel to Nashville to find out\n'Come and look at this,' says Taylor Swift. She leads the way into the specially customised tour bus that will be her home for the next six months. We go past the fully functioning fireplace and the massive flat-screen television, under the arch with her motto – 'Never Never Never Give Up' – written across it in swirly gold letters, then past the Napoleonic bed with its fluffy toys and the framed double-platinum copy of her album Fearless on the wall. And there, sandwiched between the bed and the second bathroom, is what looks like a large black trapdoor.\n\n'What's that?' I ask.\n\n'It's a treadmill!' she says excitedly. 'Look, it hinges down so I can have a run whenever I feel like taking some exercise. Isn't that really cool?'\n\nTwo years ago, if Swift wanted to go for a run, or to a gym, no one would have taken much notice. But not anymore. Now, whenever she steps out of her bus there will be thousands of people clamouring for her autograph, or trying to take her picture, or just lunging forward hoping to grab a piece of her.\n\nLast year, Swift's second album, Fearless, spent 11 weeks at No 1 in the Billboard charts – thus making her the biggest-selling artist of 2008 in America. No other album, let alone a country music album, had spent as long at the top of the charts in a decade. According to Billboard's Music Moneymaker list, this boosted her annual income to over $45 million. In January, tickets went on sale to her August 27 concert in New York's Madison Square Garden (seating capacity 18,000). They sold out in one minute. Sales were a little more sluggish for her concert at the Staples Center in LA. That sold out in two minutes. Oh yes, and there's something else you should know about Taylor Swift: she's 19 years old.\n\nHer songs, all of which she writes – or co-writes – are generally about what it's like to be a nervous teenage girl, standing confused on the edge of adulthood, full of secret crushes and unfulfilled longings – 'Hey Stephen/know looks can be deceiving/ but I know I saw a light in you as we walked/ we were talking and I didn't say half the things I wanted to.'\n\nFrom this, you might assume that Swift is a nervous, awkward sort of girl herself, riven with crises of confidence. This would be a mistake. As she says, she has been planning for success – for massive, global success – since she was 10. Nine years on, everything is squarely on track.\n\nAs she streaks ever upwards, her parents – stockbroker father, Scott, and mother, Andrea – look on in pride and wonder. Swift is devoted to her parents and there's a song on her last album about how much she loves her father – 'I have an excellent father/ his strength is making me stronger.' However, one can't help feeling that the dynamics in the Swift family must have changed quite a bit lately. Andrea Swift will be accompanying her daughter for much of the tour. But while Taylor will be in the double-bed on her tour bus, Andrea will be in one of the two bunks nearby.\n\nYet, if Swift's inner core has been forged out of the toughest steel, on the outside there are still a few trappings of youth – of childhood even. Offstage, there's an engaging sort of gawkiness to her as she teeters across the floor in her high-heeled boots, her shoulders hunched forward, her arms hanging loosely by her sides as if she's not quite sure what to do with them. All that disappears, though, the moment she steps in front of a camera. Instantly, she starts pouting her lips, teasing up her cascade of blond ringlets and jiggling her hips about.\n\n'Is this a kind of me-enjoying-the-moment shot?' she asks the photographer, 'Or do you want me looking directly to camera?'\n\nNot long afterwards, she sits down on one of the two matching oxblood leather sofas on her bus and hugs a cushion to her chest as she describes how she wrote her first song aged 10 because she was unhappy at school.\n\n'I guess that's something everyone goes through. But it hit me really hard because I had this big group of cool friends and then one day they just decided not to be friends with me anymore. I don't know why – in fact, I still don't. The one thing I had to hold on to was that I could go home afterwards and write a song about it. One of the great joys about it was that it enabled me to have the last word. And I still feel like that now. If someone hurts you and you write a song about it, and that song is going to be played on the radio and everywhere… well,' she says opening her grey-blue eyes very wide in a plausible imitation of innocence, 'that's just about the best revenge you can possibly imagine.'\n\nA year after completing her first song – 'I think it's floating around somewhere online; I sound just like a little chipmunk' – Swift had compiled a sizeable portfolio of work. She'd also recorded her first demo. After much persuading, her parents agreed to drive her from their Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania to Nashville so that she could hawk it round the country music stations.\n\n'I'd seen a TV programme about the country singer Faith Hill, and it said that she had gone to Nashville when she was young. So I got this epiphany and decided I had to go there too – because Nashville is where dreams come true!'\n\nBut you were only 11!\n\n'Uh-huh.'\n\nI mean… That shows incredible self-belief.\n\n'Thank you!' she says nodding graciously, her arms still clasping the cushion to her chest. 'Mind you, I think I knew I was a bit weird even then. For instance, my brother Austin is 17 years old now and he doesn't know what he wants to do with his life. My mom is always saying to him, \"Look Austin, you're the normal one. Taylor is the one who's weird. People just aren't supposed to figure out what they want to do when they're 11.\" But I did – and I've never altered. And now I'm really pleased that I was miserable in school. After all, think what might have happened if I'd been happy; I could still be in Pennsylvania.'\n\nNot altogether surprisingly, the first time Swift went to Nashville she attracted more guffaws of amusement than anything else. 'Basically, all the record companies went, \"Ah, how cute. She's just a little kid.\" They also said, \"Give up your dreams. Go home and come back when you're 18.\" I chose not to hear that. I wasn't prepared to accept that I wasn't a relevant artist until I was 18, and so I just kept coming back.'\n\nAt this point her eyes flicker briefly up to the motto emblazoned above the archway: 'Never Never Never Give up.' That, of course, was never an option. A year later, Swift tried again – only to be greeted with more guffaws. But then, another year on, things finally started to change. When she was 13, RCA caved in and offered her a development deal.\n\nAt the same time Sony gave her a contract to write songs. In order to be near Nashville, she persuaded the family to move house. The Swifts duly settled in Hendersonville, a small town 10 miles away. Hendersonville, Taylor says, is a 'little bit more down-home than Nashville. There are a lot more trucks, put it that way.'\n\nAnd so began what she describes as 'a really weird existence. I was a teenager during the day when I was at school, and then at night it was like I was 45. My mom would pick me up from school and I'd go downtown and sit and write songs with these hit songwriters.'\n\nThe prevailing wisdom in Nashville held that no sane person under the age of 25 would ever dream of buying a country album. Swift, who had been listening to Dolly Parton and Patsy Cline since age 10, was convinced this was nonsense. 'All the songs I heard on the radio were about marriage and kids and settling down. I just couldn't relate to that. I kept writing songs about the guy who I dated for a couple of weeks and who cheated on me, about all the things I was going through… I felt there was no reason why country music shouldn't relate to someone my age if someone my age was writing it.'\n\nAfter a year Swift had to play her new songs for the assembled topbrass at RCA. 'Basically, there were three things that were going to happen. Either they were going to drop me, or shelve me – that's kind of like putting me in cold storage – or give me a record deal. Of course, the only one of those that you want is the record deal. But they announced they were going to shelve me, and \"monitor my progress\" until I was 18.'\n\nAs far as she was concerned, this was just as bad as being dropped. 'I mean, I was 14,' she says, her voice arching upwards in indignation. 'I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I'd written all these songs and I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.'\n\nSo she did something unprecedented in Nashville: she walked away from the biggest record label in town. At the same time, she told Sony not to bother selling any of her songs as she wanted to sing them herself. After setting up a showcase concert herself, she was the first artist signed to an indie label being set up by a former DreamWorks executive named Scott Borchetta.\n\nSwift's first album came out when she was 16. It sold pretty well, making it into the lower reaches of the Billboard Country Music Top 20. Then, just when sales might have been expected to tail off, they started to rise. Week after week the album hauled itself up the charts until it had reached No 1 in the mainstream chart. Last November came her second album, Fearless. This was faster off the blocks – much faster. It went straight to No 1 and stayed there for eight consecutive weeks.\n\nThere are those who question whether Swift is really a country singer at all, claiming – with some justification – that her songs sound much more like slickly produced soft rock. But as country music currently sells more than any other music genre in the US, and has the most loyal fan base, she's quite happy to flaunt her Nashville credentials for all they're worth.\n\nShe's also taken great pains to cultivate her fans, posting regular blogs on MySpace – she now has more than a million friends on Facebook. 'I do make a big effort to keep in touch and I'm sure that's made a difference. But I think what people respond to most of all is my honesty. I write really honest songs about things that have really happened to me.'\n\nApart from an awful lot of crushes, she seems to have had few real boyfriends. One very public relationship with Joe Jonas of the US boy band the Jonas Bros, came unstuck last year and she's still plainly feeling raw – it was the only subject I was forbidden to ask about. Otherwise, her self control never seems to have wavered, not for a moment. There has never been any scandal attached to her, no lurid tabloid headlines, no embarrassing video clips. She's never drunk alcohol, never gone through a period of adolescent rebellion and still lives in Hendersonville with her parents when she's not on her tour bus. Far from damaging her reputation, all this wholesomeness seems only to have enhanced it.\n\n'It's true that I've never had a burning desire to rebel against my parents,' she says. 'But in other respects I think I have rebelled. I mean, I rebelled against my record label when they wanted to shelve me, and I've rebelled against people trying to push me around in the recording studio. To me, that's always been much more exciting than going out and getting drunk. I remember at high school trying to cheer up my girlfriends who were crying in the bathroom after some party when they couldn't remember who they'd made out with the night before.'\n\nThen she leans forward on the oxblood sofa and, suddenly sounding so earnest that she's almost plaintive, says, 'You see, I don't ever want to be that girl in the bathroom crying.'\n\nThat evening there's a premiere of the new Miley Cyrus movie, Hannah Montana, in Nashville, which would that weekend take $34 million at the US box office – the second-biggest Easter opening of all time. Swift appears briefly in the movie and sings one song on the soundtrack. However, it's plain who the hordes of waiting fans really want to see. 'Tay-lor!', they chant. 'Tay-lor! Tay-lor, Tay-lor!'\n\nWhen she emerges from out of a darkened car park entrance wearing a white dress and another pair of teetering heels, instead of walking down the red carpet into the cinema, she heads over to the waiting fans to pose for photos and sign autographs in her big loopy handwriting. As she does so, the assembled television cameras swing round so that they're all focused on her, rather than on the stars of the movie, who are left marooned on the red carpet.\n\nSwift's father, Scott, shakes his head in disbelief. 'This is beyond anything I've ever seen,' he says. He's standing right beside me, but he still has to shout to make himself heard. Even then, his words barely emerge from his mouth before they're carried away, swallowed up in a sea of screaming.\n\nTaylor Swift's single 'Tears on My Guitar' is released May 25 on Mercury Records.

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift — Love Story by Christopher Walsh, 04.17.2009\nEngineer's Diary:\nWith her second album, Fearless, Taylor Swift has emerged as country music's newest superstar. Singing with a maturity beyond her 18 years, Swift has also demonstrated outstanding songwriting ability, writing or co-writing every track on both albums.\n\n\"Love Story\" features all that and an irresistible melody, too. With co-producer Nathan Chapman, tracking engineer Chad Carlson and mix engineer Justin Niebank, Swift created \"Love Story\" at Blackbird Studio in Nashville (featured in last month's cover story, \"Tools of the Town: Gear Trends in Nashville\"). Tracking took place in the API Legacy Plus-equipped Studio D; Niebank mixed on the Solid State Logic 9080 K Series console in Studio F. In between, overdubs took place in Studio E.\n\nNathan Chapman:\nSwift sang into an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern tube microphone from Avant Electronics. \"It has a new old stock tube that the engineer Ray Kennedy put in it for me,\" Chapman explains. \"I've tried a lot of different mics on Taylor; I had that mic on loan from Ray as a 'try this for a while' mic, and Taylor came to the house to do a radio edit on one of her songs from the first album. When she put on the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!' She had no idea what it was, just loved it, and I went along with something that felt right for her. We've been using it ever since, and it sounds great on her voice.\n\n\"The vocal was a tracking vocal — that's the vocal she cut live with the band,\" Chapman reveals. \"The band was just acoustic guitar, bass and drums; everything else was overdubbed.\n\n\"I pulled Justin Niebank's stems into my laptop and used [Apple] Logic to do the pop version,\" Chapman continues. \"I did the mix tweaks and new parts on my laptop. I muted the country instruments and added the elements that you can hear in the pop version — banjo, fiddle, electric guitar. The pop version's opening beat is a Logic loop in the Ultrabeat beat generator. All the new electric guitars were done with the Amplitube Stomp I/O. I think there are nine acoustic guitars on that track, and I stacked several background vocals — me singing, 'Ah's.'\"\n\nChristopher Walsh is the recording editor for Pro Sound News and the associate editor of Pro Audio Review.\n\nSong Facts\nSingle: \"Love Story\"\nAlbum: Fearless\nDate Recorded: March 2008\nProducers: Nathan Chapman, Taylor Swift\nEngineer: Chad Carlson\nMixer: Justin Niebank\nMastering Engineer: Hank Williams\nOther Projects: Chapman produced and played a multitude of instruments on Swift's first, eponymous album.

      "Transcript/Content": "Growing into stardom\nBy Cathalena E. Burch May 14, 2009 \nGrowing into stardom  \n\nEven after you tick down Taylor Swift's growing and glowing list of accolades —\n\n• Best-selling artist in 2008;\n\n• Landed on Forbes ranking for earnings;\n\n• Sold-out headlining arena concerts;\n\n• 2009 Academy of Country Music top album honors;\n\n— she can tell you exactly what went through her head four years ago when she was just a little girl with a guitar playing Boise, Idaho's, Buffalo Club.\n\n\"I didn't even have a single out,\" the 19-year-old singer-songwriter recalled during a conference call May 1 with a handful of journalists. \"I remember they told me I was going to play an hour-and-15-minute set.\"\n\nShe did what she had done at ages 12 and 13 when she had to fill a three-hour coffeehouse shift.\n\nPeople are also reading…\n3 motorcyclists killed in Cochise County crash\nA list of Tucson places staying open on Thanksgiving 2024\nHealth officials ignored as pandemic raged through Tucson church\nPCC to demolish 3 historic, rundown Tucson motels\n\"When I would run out of original material, I would start making stuff up, and that's what I did at the Buffalo Club,\" she said\n\nThree years after the release of her eponymous Big Machine debut, Swift is easily the biggest star in pop music at this moment. Earlier this year, her modern-day take on Romeo and Juliet, \"Love Story,\" was spinning like crazy on Radio Disney and was getting equal love from pop and country radio. It hasn't hurt that Swift counts among her friends Disney heavyweights Miley Cyrus (\"Hannah Montana\") and the Jonas Brothers (she toured with them and briefly dated Joe, the middle Jo Bro).\n\nNow she is selling out her maiden headlining tour with the speed of Cyrus and the Jo Bros, including next Thursday's show in Glendale.\n\n\"What I love about the fact that I've been played on pop radio . . . is that I'm still a country artist and everyone knows that,\" she explained when asked if the Disney plug has helped propel her career into fast-forward.\n\nHer three-year climb has been comfortably paced, says Swift.\n\n\"In a way it's been a gradual climb,\" she explained. \"I had 2 1/2 years of beginner success, then kind of intermediate success, mild success and then when my second album came out, that's when everything in my life changed. All of a sudden . . . every single show sold out and everything was just so much bigger than it happened before. I'm really, really lucky that I got those 2 1/2 years of gradual climb before the craziness started.\"\n\nYou get a sense talking to Swift that she is in near complete control of her destiny. She writes all her own songs and designed every aspect of her arena tour, from the costume changes and stage lifts, to the video segments. It also was her decision to sit down for a three-song acoustic set like the one she played at Boise's Buffalo Club.\n\n\"It's just me and my guitar again. When you hear people scream, it's the same rush I got at the Buffalo Club,\" she said. \"It's just . . . there are a lot more people screaming.\"\n\nWhen one of the reporters on the conference call asked if anyone had criticized her for \"pushing things a little too far\" with her more revealing outfits in recent photo shoots, Swift's response was polite but stern.\n\n\"I've never heard any negative feedback from any photo shoot I've done because I tend to keep my clothes on. That's something that I have a rule about,\" she said. \"They put red lipstick on me, which I think if people think that's suggestive I can't really do anything about that because I think it's fun to play around through fashion. . . . I don't think I've really pushed it very far at all.\"\n\nSwift also shoots down those who are waiting for the day that her success goes to her head — inspiring all sorts of diva scenarios, from bad boyfriend decisions to the pitfalls of drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nShe would never do that to her fans, she said.\n\n\"It is a constant pressure, a constant reminder that you have to have your fans' interests in mind no matter what you're doing. . . . I don't what to have to deal with the pressure and guilt of lying to my fans,\" she said. \"That's why I live my life the way I do. It's never been a temptation for me.\"\n\nThere's also no need to worry that all her newfound celebrity, riches and perks will go to her head.\n\n\"I'm surrounded by people who really could care less how many albums I've sold. My mom is never, ever going to let (stardom) affect her parenting,\" said Swift, whose parents uprooted the family from their native Redding, Pa., and moved to Nashville when Swift was 11 so she could pursue her dream.\n\n\"(Mom) is going to absolutely tell me the whole truth and tell me what I don't want to hear a lot of the time. And I love that and I appreciate that. Having people around you that will tell you when they don't like how you're acting is so important.\"\n\nRead more country music news in Cathalena E.

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift got a ‘rush’ singing at this Boise nightclub. After 22 years, it’s closing\nMichael Deeds\nFri, February 9, 2024 at 7:43 PM GMT+13 min read\n\n\nWhen I wrote about The Buffalo Club opening in 2002, an Idaho Statesman headline called it “a surefire hit.”\n\nAnd why not?\n\nAn 8,000-square-foot country nightclub at 10206 Fairview Ave., it offered everything a Boise cowboy could want. Three separate bars. One in front for shots and socializing. A larger middle room with a stage and dance floor. And for outlaws hiding from the sheriff? A space filled with pool tables in the back.\n\nIn 2006, it even had Taylor Swift.\n\nBut after 22 years, it’s last call. The Buffalo Club is closing.\n\nIn an online message written “with sadness and a sense of changing times,” The Buffalo Club explained that the rest of this week, ending Sunday, would be “our last party nights at the Buff.”\n\nClosures are inevitable. Nightlife scenes evolve. “We can’t say we are surprised,” longtime house band The Saloonatics wrote on Facebook. “Lots of great memories.”\n\nSwift in the house\nFor a lucky few, the biggest memory is a high-school-age Taylor Swift strumming an acoustic guitar and singing on stage.\n\nSwift stopped at The Buffalo Club during a promotional tour, the sort of gig that involved signing autographs, posing for photos and, crucially, making an impression with local radio bigwigs who might play her single. Typically, this type of show might require a 30-minute performance.\n\nNot in Boise. By the time I got a chance to ask Swift about The Buffalo Club three years later, she was a seasoned 19-year-old headlining sold-out arenas.\n\n“I remember they told me, ‘All right, well, you’re going to play an hour-and-15-minute set tonight,’ ” Swift said, reminiscing by phone. “It was just me and my guitar, and my single wasn’t even out yet, and we didn’t even know what songs were going to go on my album.\n\nTaylor Swift entertains fans at the Idaho Center (now Ford Idaho Center) in Nampa during a show in 2009. During a conference-call interview prior to traveling to Idaho for the concert, she recalled performing at The Buffalo Club three years earlier.

Darin Oswald/Statesman file photo\nMore\n“I remember going out there and being a little nervous. But when I got out in front of that crowd, they were so amazing. I kind of reverted to when I was younger, and I played a coffeehouse for a three-hour shift.”\n\n“Things are definitely a lot different now,” Swift added. “But it’s really fun to be able to go out and do an acoustic set in the middle of the show and just be me and a guitar. When you hear people scream, it’s the same rush I got at The Buffalo Club. It’s just a different pitch, and there are a lot more people screaming.”\n\nMore in Sports\n\nOhio State police issue statement after pepper spraying Michigan football players\nWolverines Wire\n\nOhio State tumbles in US LBM Coaches Poll rankings, while Texas moves behind No. 1 Oregon\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nTom Brady is Wasting Fox Sports’ $375 Million, Columnist Says\nThe Wrap\n\nAn illegal hit on Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence led the player to be carted off the field and sparked an ejection.\nNBC News\nI’d expect a few more screams at The Buffalo Club on its final night — whenever Swift is shown on TV cheering for the Kansas City Chiefs during the Super Bowl.\n\nCountry bar farewells\nSwift isn’t the only famous musician who appeared at The Buffalo Club on the way up. Other acts have included Luke Bryan, Miley Cyrus and Big & Rich. There’s a list on the nightclub’s website.\n\nThe Buffalo Club’s demise leaves few remaining bar options for country fans in the Boise area. Cowgirls in Kuna also bought the farm recently by rebranding as Nocturno Latin Club & Lounge.\n\nPrior to the late bar owner Russ Purcell opening The Buffalo Club, the space had operated as The Palace.\n\nWith its special history, The Buffalo Club will be uniquely missed.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: Bomb-Shell in Blue Jeans\nLet's just tell it like it is: 19-year-old Taylor Swift is a bona fide superstar. Her 2006 self-titled debut album went triple platinum. Her most recent effort, Fearless, sold 2.1 million copies in less than two months. When she won Album of the Year at the 2009 Academy of Country Music Awards, she was the youngest person in history ever to do so, and last year she sold more albums than any other artist. (People, that means a teen country singer beat out Britney, Lil Wayne and Coldplay!) Just how did she manage to pull it all off? The answer's in her songs: She spares no one. After Joe Jonas of the Jonas Brothers broke off their relationship via a 27-second-long phone call, Taylor penned the hit song \"Forever & Always,\" saying: \"Did I say something way too honest/That made you run and hide like a scared little boy?\" \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was about a boy she pined over in high school: \"Drew looks at me/I fake a smile so he won't see/What I want and what I need/And everything that we should be.\"\n\nNot that Swift is waiting around for Jonas or Drew to come to their senses. When I meet the singer at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi, Mississippi, she's sitting in a tricked-out tour bus, preparing to perform on this stop of her 52-city tour. Swift's been prepping for this success her entire life. \"Her fingers would crack from so much playing,\" Taylor's mom, Andrea, writes in an e-mail. \"She was driven beyond anything I had ever witnessed.\"\n\nNow she's a hit maker who is juggling her role as one of the world's top recording artists with trying to be, well, a teenager. When Glamour talked to her, Swift opened up about friends, fame and moving out of her parents' house (someday!).\n\nGLAMOUR: OK, you were the top-selling artist last year. That's incredible! Do you have any idea of what a huge accomplishment that is?\n\nWATCH\n\n\nThe Best Moments From the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar Party\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: When I get news like that, it just blows my mind, because I've been trying to do this all my life. I remember the girls who would come to talent shows and say to anyone they met, \"I'm so-and-so—I'm going to be famous someday.\" I was never that girl. I would show up with my guitar and say, \"This is a song I wrote about a boy in my class.\" And that's what I still do today.\n\nGLAMOUR: Your confessional style—all those guys you write about—obviously struck a chord. Now that you're famous, do you ever feel like you might need to tone that down?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: I've never felt like I needed to tone down being seen as a regular person. When I first started doing MySpace, I wrote my bio in the first person. I didn't want my MySpace page to look like a publicity promo site, so I was the one doing all the commenting, and I was the one putting up pictures and videos. And I've approached my whole career like that—I don't see that ever changing.\n\nGLAMOUR: A lot of people who reach a level of fame similar to yours become guarded.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: I get some paparazzi, but not enough to make me ever not appreciate what I have. It's like, I wanted one thing [my] whole life…. I'm not going to get it and then complain about it.\n\nGLAMOUR: What's a typical day like when you're on tour?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: On any given day I do five or six different interviews. If we are somewhere really pretty, I'll try to experience the place I'm in. Today I'm going to head to the beach. My meet and greet schedule starts at 5:00 P.M. The show starts at 8:00 P.M. Then, I'll do a mass meet and greet with people who won a radio contest, or who we found in the nosebleed section.\n\nGLAMOUR: Would you say you're a bit of a workaholic?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: Yes. I get really restless when I haven't worked for a day and a half. I have a recurring dream that people are lined up next to my bed, waiting for autographs and taking pictures of me!\n\nGLAMOUR: Do you ever have to put up boundaries? Or want a day in which you don't have to sign autographs?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: Some people get freaked out by huge displays of emotion from fans, but I like criers and people who come up to me bawling and screaming. Hearing a crowd scream is the coolest sound in the world. It can motivate me to do anything.\n\nGLAMOUR: You have said, \"Music is my boyfriend.\" How do you date when you're as famous as you are?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: I don't date a lot. The other day I was in my dressing room with one of my closest friends, [American Idol alum] Kellie Pickler, who is also my opening act, and she said something really interesting to me: \"We can only give someone what's left over.\" She does the same thing I do, so she knows what it's like to do interviews all day and give your heart and soul on stage every night. After all of that is taken, we can only give someone what's left. So it's hard.\n\nMost Popular\nCELEBRITY GOSSIP\nKate Middleton Is Seen in a New, Seemingly Unaltered Photo With Prince William\nBY ELIZABETH LOGAN\n\nBEAUTY\nZendaya Just Created a New Nail Trend at the Oscars\nBY MELANIE PAUKNER\n\nENTERTAINMENT\nRyan Gosling’s Oscars Date Was His Sister, Not Wife Eva Mendes\nBY STEPHANIE MCNEAL\n\nGLAMOUR: What would a relationship look like for you?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: It's always going to be long-distance, even if I date the boy who lives next door to me in Nashville. I'll be flying to see him and flying him places to see me. It feels like it would involve more scheduling, and I already deal with a lot of scheduling in my life. Of course, if I met somebody who was worth it, I would probably stop thinking that way!\n\nGLAMOUR: Do you think you'd have to date someone at a similar level of success?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: I think it's more a question of confidence. I wouldn't want to be with a pushover who would let me make all the plans and have all the control. It's really natural for me to go into planning mode, but I'd rather be with someone who has his own voice and passion and ambition.\n\nGLAMOUR: I recently read a study that found that most people who ended up being mega successful had experienced massive failure earlier in their career. Have you experienced anything like that?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: I had a record deal that didn't work out, and it was devastating to me. When I was 13, I got a meeting with RCA Records, and they said they wanted to sign me to a development deal. That means they want to watch you, but they're not promising to make an album with you—kind of like a guy who wants to date you but not be your boyfriend. After a year you turn in your songs, and they decide whether they want to shelf you—keep watching you—drop you or sign you to a record deal. They decided to shelf me, and I had a choice to make. I could have stayed in development with them, but I figured that if they didn't believe in me then, they weren't ever going to believe in me. So I made a tough decision and struck out on my own.\n\nGLAMOUR: What sets you apart from other young women who've achieved success at a young age, then gone on to blow it with partying and bad behavior?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: I've never been fascinated by the party lifestyle. Sometimes people look at me like, You're 19 and don't want to rebel? For me, rebelling is done with words: I love to write honest songs that name real people, then get up onstage and live out those emotions in front of 15,000 people. Penciling in a night to get wasted is not something I want to do.\n\nGLAMOUR: What about doing normal teen stuff?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: I don't think I'd be a party girl [even if I were] in college. When I was in high school, I remember seeing girls crying in the bathroom every Monday about what they did at a party that weekend. I never wanted to be that girl crying in the bathroom. But there are certain things that I would like to do but can't. Sometimes I don't get invited to things because my friends know it's going to be a hassle to take me.\n\nMost Popular\nCELEBRITY GOSSIP\nKate Middleton Is Seen in a New, Seemingly Unaltered Photo With Prince William\nBY ELIZABETH LOGAN\n\nBEAUTY\nZendaya Just Created a New Nail Trend at the Oscars\nBY MELANIE PAUKNER\n\nENTERTAINMENT\nRyan Gosling’s Oscars Date Was His Sister, Not Wife Eva Mendes\nBY STEPHANIE MCNEAL\n\nGLAMOUR: Really? Is that true?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: I'll find out that a group of my friends went out to dinner, but they wanted it to be a low-key night and not worry about people coming up to the table every other second and asking for autographs, so they didn't invite me. I can understand that.\n\nGLAMOUR: Do you ever feel like you've missed out on having a childhood?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: No, because I couldn't have asked for more from my childhood. My mom quit working when I was four, so she was always around, and my dad is just hilarious—you'll meet him. [I later found Swift's father riding a Segway scooter around the arena parking lot, handing out guitar picks that bore his daughter's image.] I grew up on a Christmas tree farm with all this space to run around, and the [freedom] to be a crazy kid with tangled hair.\n\nGLAMOUR: You once wrote a song about a friend who was struggling with anorexia. Do you ever have body insecurities?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: I think the reason a lot of celebrities feel insecure and want to stop eating altogether is because they see so many pictures of themselves on a daily basis. It's unhealthy how many times you see your own image—it's just constant. When you see something enough, you're going to tear it down to the point where some days you feel like you're not even pretty. I get insecure about my eyes because I once read a blog comment that said, \"Her eyes are so small.\" I thought, Are my eyes small? Oh no—they are!\n\nGLAMOUR: So you read blog comments? A lot of celebrities claim to avoid them.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: I've stopped reading the comments below news articles and on gossip blogs because those are the ones that'll ruin your day in a second. But I read my MySpace comments because they're awesome. You just have to be careful and filter the information you give yourself. Do you want to open the slam book today? Nope.\n\nGLAMOUR: And what are your top three craziest, pinch-yourself moments?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: Definitely performing on Saturday Night Live. I got to meet Kristen Wiig and Andy Samberg, who are some of my favorite people. Playing the Houston Rodeo for 72,000 people. Every one of them had a ticket stub with my name on it. And doing the cover of Rolling Stone. I never expected that would happen in my lifetime, and I definitely didn't think it would happen when I was 19!\n\nGLAMOUR: Wow, what's left?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: I still have lots of goals. I'd love to do a world tour. And at some point, I'd like to move out of my parents' house! [Laughs.]\n\nGLAMOUR: And after that? What kind of life do you picture 10, 20 years from now?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: As far as my career goes, I hope I'm still touring. I'd love to always be present in music, writing songs, but I'm not the kind of person who will hang around if I become irrelevant. I'll bow out gracefully, raise my kids and have a garden. And I'm going to let my hair go gray when I'm older—I don't need to be blond when I'm 60!",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript & Translation] Taylor Swift and \"Hannah Montana\" newcomer Lucas Till\nIn Tay's new video, Lucas plays her crush - hot kisses included!\n\nIs the next Hollywood love on the horizon? We see two of the hottest stars at the moment playing and kissing! Country girl Taylor Swift (19) and \"Hannah Montana\" actor Lucas Till (18). The hot flirting happens in Taylor's new video You Belong With Him, but it's obvious that there was still a spark between the two after filming ended! Lucas, who will be seen in cinemas from June 1st alongside Miley Cyrus (15) in Hannah Montana: The Movie, raves like he's newly in love: Tay is awesome! When I stand in front of her, my knees go weak. Just a short time after the video shoot, the blond good-looker was even seen at Taylor's concert in Jacksonville, Florida. He sat in the front row next to Tay's parents! Something's going on, isn't it? After splitting up with Joe Jonas (19), the singer certainly seems ready for a new love. And Lucas, who is already considered the hottest newcomer of the year in the USA, wouldn't be the worst catch either...\n\nTaylor Swift: It's cool to be different!\nTaylor is a mega star in the USA! The singer reveals exclusively in BRAVO how she wants to make it here too.\n\nShe has breakfast with Demi Lovato (16), goes to the cinema with Gomez (16) and goes shopping with Miley Cyrus (16). The whole Hollywood clique is crazy about country singer Taylor Swift (19). In America, the 1.80 meter tall blonde from Hendersonville, Tennessee is considered \"The Next Big Thing\". And now Taylor wants to make it here too with her album Fearless (out on May 15th). \nBRAVO met the girl in London and was blown away by the sweet chatterbox in the Barbie look. Her greeting: Hey, I look so sweet. But I know exactly what I want!\"\nBRAVO: Wow, you're very self-confident! Was it always like that?\nTAYLOR: Unfortunately not. I used to hate the way I looked, especially my curls. And with my height I felt like a stork. Today I've learned that these peculiarities make me special. So I can only advise everyone: Being different from others means. You are unique. And that's cool! Even if others don't see it that way...\nBRAVO: Was that the case with you?\nTAYLOR: Yes! The boys in particular made fun of me because I was taller than them. That's why no one was interested in me!\nBRAVO: When did you have your first boyfriend?\nTAYLOR: I was a total late bloomer compared to my friends! I had my first boyfriend at 15 and with him my first kiss.\nBRAVO. Has anything embarrassing ever happened to you with a boy?\nTAYLOR: Oh yes! I'm a real clumsy. I once saw a really cute boy at school waving at me. It wasn't until I waved back that I realized he was actually talking about the beautiful girl behind me. That happened to me almost every day back then!\nBRAVO How are things going in your love life at the moment?\nTAYLOR: I'm still looking for the right guy.\nBRAVO: What kind of guy does he have to be?\nTAYLOR: Definitely ambitious and self-confident! I don't like guys who are always hanging on my coattails. He has to stand on his own two feet and understand my demanding job.\nBRAVO Do you have a particular type that you like?\nTAYLOR: No. I don't care if he's fat or thin, straight hair, curly hair, brown or blonde. The main thing is that the character is right and we share the same preferences - for example, music.\nBRAVO What do you listen to?\nTAYLOR: I have mostly songs by the Kings of Leon, John Mayer and Justin Timberlake on my iPod. I like anything that's catchy and has great lyrics. It's like with the boys - the main thing is that the content is right!\n\nOriginal German Transcription:\n\nTaylor Swift und „Hannah Montana\"-Newcomer Lucas Till\nIn Tays neuem Video spielt Lucas ihren Schwarm- heiße Kusse Inklusive!\n\nBahnt sich da etwa die nächste Hollywood-Liebe an? Wir sehen zwei der momentan angesagtesten Stars beim Turtain-und beim Küssen! Country-Girl Taylor Swift (19) und Hannah Montana\"-Darsteller Lucas Till (18). Der heiße Flirt passiert zwar in Taylors neuem Video You Belong With He-doch offensichtlich hat es auch nach Dreh- schluss zwischen den beiden gefunkt! Lucas, der ab 1. Juni neben Miley Cyrus (15) in Hannah Montana-Der Film\" im Kino zu sehen sein wird, schwärmt jadenfalls wie frisch verknallt: lay ist der Hammer! Wenn ich ihr gegenüber- stehe, bekomme ich weiche Knie. Nur kurze Zeit nach dem Videodreh wurde der blonde Goodlooker sogar bei Taylors Konzert in Jacksonville/Florida gesahen. Er safl in der ersten Reiheneben Tays Eltern! Da geht doch was!? Nach der Tren- nung von Joe Jonas (19) scheint die Sänge rin jedenfalls bereit für eine neue Liebe. Und Lucas, der in den USA schon als heillester Newcomer des Jahres gilt, wäre ja auch nicht der schlechteste Fang...\n\nTaylor Swift: Es ist cool, anders zu sein!\n\nIn den USA ist Taylor ein Mega-Star! Exklusiv in BRAVO verrät die Sängerin, wie sie jetzt auch bei uns durchstarten will.\n\nSie frühstückt mit Demi Lovato (16), geht mit Gomez (16) ins Kino und shoppt mit Miley Cyrus (16). Die ganze Hollywood-Clique ist verrückt nach Country-Sängerin Taylor Swift (19). In Amerika gilt die 1,80 Meter große Blondine aus Hendersonville/Tennessee als „The Next Big Thing\" (auf gut Deutsch: der nächste Megastar). Und jetzt will Taylor mit ihrem Album Fearless\" (seit 15.5.) auch bei uns durch- starten.  BRAVO traf das Girl in Londen und war hin und weg von dem süflen Plappermaul im Barbie-Look. Ihre Begrüßung Hey, ich seh vielleicht lieb aus. Aber ich weiß ganz genau, was ich will!\"\nBRAVO: Wow, du bist ja sehr selbstbewusst! War das immer so?\nTAYLOR: Leider nicht. Früher habe ich mein Aussehen gehasst, vor allem meine Lo cken. Und mit meiner Gröfle fühlte ich mich wie ein Storch. Heute habe ich gelernt, dass mich diese Eigenarten zu etwas Besonderem machen. Von daher kann ich nur jedem raten: Anders als andere zu sein bedeutet. Du bist einzigartig. Und das ist cool! Auch\nwenn andere das nicht so sehen...\nBRAVO: War das bei dir so?\nTAYLOR: Ja! Vor allem die Boys haben über mich gelästert, weil ich größer war als sie. Daher hat sich auch keiner für mich interessiert!\nBRAVO: Wann hattest du denn deinen ersten Freund?\nTAYLOR: Ich war im Vergleich zu meinen Freundinnen eine totale Spätzünderin! Mit 15 hatte ich meinen ersten Freund und mit ihm auch meinen ersten Kuss.\nBRAVO. Ist dir schon mal etwas Peinliches mit einem Boy passiert?\nTAYLOR: Oh ja! Ich bin ein richtiger Tollpatsch. Einmal sah ich in der Schule einen total süflen Jungen, der mir zuwinkte. Erst, als ich ihm zurückwinkte, bemerkte ich, dass er eigentlich das bildhübsche Mädchen hinter mir meinte. So etwas ist mir damals fast jeden Tag passiert!\nBRAVO Wie sieht es denn momentan bei dir in der Liebe aus?\nTAYLOR: Ich bin noch auf der Suche nach dem Richtigen.\nBRAVO: Wie muss er denn sein?\nTAYLOR: Auf jeden Fall ehrgeizig und selbstbewusst! Ich mag keine Jungs, die mir ständig am Rock zipfel hängen. Er muss auf eigenen Beinen stehen und Verständnis für\nmeinen anstrengenden Job haben.\nBRAVO Hast du du einen bestimm ten Typ, auf den du stehst?\nTAYLOR: Nein. Mir ist völlig egal, ob dick, ob dünn, glatte Haare, Locken, braun oder blond. Die Hauptsache ist, dass der Charakter stimmt und wir die gleichen Vorlieben teilen- zum Beispiel für Musik.\nBRAVO Was hörst du denn so?\nTAYLOR: Auf meinem iPod habe ich vor allem Songs von den Kings Of Leon, John Mayer und Justin Timberlake. Ich mag alles, was sofort ins Ohr geht und einen tollen Text hat. Das ist wie bei den Boys-Hauptsache, der Inhalt stimmt!",

      "Transcript/Content": "When Taylor Swift was sitting on the floor in her bedroom composing her song \"Love Story\" drew on her fascination with fairy tales to come up with the romantic ending. Now turn the page to Taylor's \"Love Story\" and you'll see the next single \"White Horse\". \"That is a song about walking away from the Love Story guy\", Taylor says, her eyes twinkling. \"I wrote it within weeks of writing \"Love Story.\" That particular guy reminded me a lot of fairytales and Prince Charming. And I guess the first thought I had in my head when I realized it wasn't going to work was, \"Wow, I guess I'm not a princess.\" Sometimes when I think out loud like that, it actually ends being a line in a song.\"\nTaylor wrote \"White Horse\" with Liz Rose, one of her favorite co-writers. \"I had the melody and part of the first verse done, and I called up Liz and asked her if she wanted to stop by the studio,\" Taylor recalls. \"I told her I've got this idea, and I think it's really cool.\" They ended up writing a haunting song with a not-so-happily-ever-after ending. The girl comes to realize that she's not the princess she had believed Prince Charming would sweep off her feet and lead up the stairwell. \"I was basically following that fairy tale theme,\" Taylor explains. \"And so I was thinking, what's the general theme of Prince Charming? Well, he's romantic, he's brave and he rides op on a white horse.\"\nTaylor and Liz finished \"White Horse\" in about 45 minutes. \"After we wrote it, I felt like I'd summed up the situation the best way I possibly could.\" Taylor sighs. \"When we're little girls, we are told by our parents and storybooks and fairy tales that we're gonna meet Prince Charming, and he's going to make everything better and sweep us off our feet. Well, this song is about when you grow up and you realize that Prince Charming can leave you waiting in the rain.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] TAYLOR SWIFT: The Hottest Ticket in Town\nhot! She's got Slots of talent. She's one of Hendersonville's own. We are proud to present Taylor Swift, voted 2009 Best Local Celebrity in our Readers' Choice survey!\n\nBY TENA LEE\n\nSumner is no stranger to celebrity. A pair of Roys - Acuff and Orbison - immedi- ately come to mind. So do Johnny and June Carter Cash, Marty Stuart, Ricky Skaggs and the Oak Ridge Boys to name a few more. They all at one time or another have made Sumner proud, and Taylor Swift, this\nsummer's hottest ticket, is no different.\nThose who know her best say it's not hard to see why our readers voted the 19-year-old country music sensation \"best local celebrity\" in our Readers' Choice survey.\nIn the five short years Swift has called Hendersonville home, her family, friends and Hendersonville High School buddies have watched her evolve from the cute blonde who wrote songs and dreamed of stardom, to a multimedia hurricane a force to be reck- oned with in the country music industry she has helped rein- vent.\nIn 2004, a 14-year-old Swift, her parents and younger brother Austin moved from Wyomissing. Pa.. to the shores of Old Hickory Lake.\n\"We chose to live in Hender- sonville because of the lake,\" Swift told Sumner Lifestyles.\n\"That was the first thing we fell in love with. My mom and I knew it would be tough to convince my dad to move, so we knew if he could take his boat, it would be easier to get him on board with the whole 'moving across the country' thing.\"\nIronically, Hendersonville had lost its most famous son less than a year before. It didn't matter what part of the world Johnny Cash was in when he mentioned that his hometown was not Nashville but actually Hendersonville, Tenn. It was that sense of normalcy amidst the chaos of celebrity that attracted the Swifts - long before Taylor even became a household name.\n\"We noticed how real the town seemed,\" Swift said. \"My parents were excited that Austin and I would get to have normal lives outside of Nashville, instead of being right there immersed in the music indus try all the time.\"\nTaylor's mom agrees.\n\"Our home in Hendersonville is our sanctuary,\" Andrea Swift said. \"We get a sense of peace and calm by looking our over that gorgeous lake. It is the perfect home to come back to and appreciate our life in a small town.\"\nSwift gave a nod to Hendersonville's musical roots by filming the video for her first single, \"Tim McGraw, at Cash's famous cabin studio, Since releasing that single three years ago, Swift's star has soared. Her self-titled debur album sold more than 3 million copies.\nIn October 2007, she received the Songwriter/Art of the Year Award from Nash ville Songwriters Association International, making her the youngest artist ever to win the award. The next month, the Country Music Association honored her with the 2007 Horizon Award given to the industry's best new artist.\nThings only got better in 2008, when she was nominated for a Grammy Award for best new artist, and her second album, \"Fearless,\" debuted at No. I on Billboard's 200 album chart.\nSwift became Billboard's Top Country Artist and Hot Country Songwriter of 2008; and was also country music's best-selling artist of 2008.\nShe most recently picked up Album of the Year honors at the 44th Annual Academy of Conatry Music Awards as a Performer and producer for Fraless She also brought home the Academy's Crystal Mile Award-a prestigious Outstanding Achieve Bet in Country Music.\nStill, she has remained remarkably grounded. And that is no accident.\n\"It still feels strange to hear the words 'super-stardom' when I think of Taylor,\" Andrea admits. \"To me, she's still the same hilariously funny, endear- ing, wonderfully sarcastic and yet completely compassionate person who grew up asking me every question known to man. I think a few more people, around the world, know her name now, so if that makes her a superstar... 1 get that. But to me, she's still Taylor, and I still remind her to take her vita- mins.\"\nLocal realtor Patty Copeland's daughter, Autumn, became fast friends with Swift when the two attended Ellis Middle School\n\nShe's always been completely and driven,\" Patty Copeland said. \"She's also the funniest kid I know.\" The girls' friendship continued through high school, where Patty Copeland said Swift has always been supportive of her friends and has been conscious of sharing the spot- leht, even after becoming a familiar face.\n\"She came to the school's Coffehouse to watch them perform,\" Patty Copeland said. \"She stood in line like everyone else. She's the same girl.\"\nWhile attending HHS, Swift quickly secured a songwriting contract with a publishing arm of Sony, becoming their youngest staff songwriter ever. She also filmed a reality TV series for Great American Country that chronicled her dual role of high school student and country star- wannabe.\nHendersonville High School Principal Joni Worsham remembers the cameras rolling back then and said Swift's legacy at the school remains.\n\"Last year a family moved to the area because they wanted their daughter to go to Taylor Swift's school,\" said Worsham of another young aspiring musician.\nWorsham, who grew up with both Cash's and Orbison's children, admitted Sumner has grown accustomed to stardom over the years. She said Swift seems to have made the adjustment well.\n\n[Missing Part]\n\nShe's a smart young lady with a good head on her shoulders. I think she's done a good job of keeping a check on reality.\"\nSwift's favorite teacher at HHS was criminal justice teacher Kirk Schwabe.\n\"His class really changed the way I think about things,\" Swift said. \"I'm much more aware of my surroundings now, and I'll always have his class to thank for that. Plus, he had really great speaking skills and knew how to put on a really entertain- ing class.\"\nSwift even admitted she had a favorite - substitute teacher at HHS, Charlie Brown. \"He's such an endearing person,\" she said. \"I ran into him at the grocery store the other day, and it was really wonderful catching up.\"\nWhen she's not on the road, Swift can be found around town at Cracker Barrel, Starbucks or a JPII lacrosse game.\n\"I go to every one of my brother's lacrosse games at JPII,\" she said, \"and I'm always driving by my old high school. It's a strange feeling to drive through the parking lot and see where I used to park my car, worried about being late to class.\"\n\"Normalcy is what we do best,\" her mom says. \"We still shop at the mall, have breakfast at Cracker Barrel and go to the\n\n[Missing Part]\n\n... schedule for the last three and half years, so I guess this is what feels \"normal\" to me. Swift didn't graduate with her friends from HHS, but received her diploma fr Aaron Academy, Hendersonville's school affiliate.\nA straight-A student, Swift adm doesn't have any plans right now to further her education. \"Right now, going to college isn't right thing for me. It would kill me to ditch a world tour and the career I've been dreaming about since I was a little girl,\" she said. \"I'd love to take classes later in life, but I don't think it's in the cards for now.\"\nAnd what's next for the teen who had dreamed of making hit records and sold-out stadiums?\n\"My newest dreams have been (?) than the dreams I had at 15,\" she said. \"One of the things I wanted at 15 have happened, and I can't believe it. Now I want to be a bridesmaid in a wedding and have a house with wood floors.\"\n\"Whatever it is that she's doing Andrea adds, \"Tm going to guess she'll be completely immersed in as always, and loving every minute of it.\"\n\nTaylor Swift Q&A\nSumner Lifestyles: What's been the biggest adjustment for you sincs you've attained your celebrity status?\nTaylor Swift: The staring. When you're in high school, you know that if people are staring at you, either your outfit is hamble or there's something in your teeth or there's a nasty rumor going around about you. Now, every where I go, there's a pretty significant amount of staring. I've had to really get used to the fact that maybe they're not staring because I have something in my teeth or my outfit is horrible.\nSL: Before you garnered your own headlining tour, you opened for some of the hottest acts in country music ell us about your or at least your favorite experience so far.\nTS: Tim (McGraw) and Faith (Hill) gave me the most presents, so I'm always going to remember that leamed so much from all of the headliners I toured with, but there's something about learning kindness from someone. Faith taught me how a small gesture of kindness can turn someone's day around. That was more than just a lesson in touring.\nSL: Many of them, like Brad Pais ley, are known for their practical jokes. What was the funniest joke someone played on you while tour on\nTS: Kellie Pickler and I became friends and bonded over trying to think of ways to prank Brad Pais ley. We got him good too. Every single night, there was something else we thought of to do to mess with him. Whether it was dress- ing up as giant ticks and running out onstage or letting live chickens out at his feet during his acoustic set, we always got him.\nSL: In April, you kicked off your first headlining tour - a 52-city extravaganza that will heat up Nashville's Sommet Center Sept. 12. What can those who have tickets to see you in Nashville in September expect?\nTS: I love the element of surprise when it comes to performances. I don't ever like to see what I'm expecting to see. I like drama and costume changes and spe cial effects and dancing. I think we've really used the right amount of surprise in this show, and I'm really happy about that. See you at the show!",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Taylor Swift, Country's Biggest Export\n\nThe guitar-strumming superstar from Tennessee country with her who crossed over from\nheart-wrenching songs of teen love.\n\nIt would be an understatement to describe Taylor Swift as merely phenomenal. This 19-year-old country-pop ingénue is super phenomenal in a way that actually beggars belief. Out of nowhere, this flaxen-haired beauty has clambered up the charts at light ning speed, melting American hearts (and emptying pockets) quicker than you can say Shania who? In the process, she became 2008's biggest-selling artist in the States, shifting more records than seems possible for a sweet teenager most of us have never heard of. Forget Kanye, Beyoncé and all the other contenders Swift trounced every one of them last year, got nominated for a Grammy, and is weeks away from the deliv ery of the obligatory doll modelled in her image. She is also ridiculously affable, pret tier than a Kansas sunset, and set for world domination by the time she's 21. So far, so annoying. But be prepared to love this girl, for she is much more than a manufactured pop puppet. Like or loathe what she does, she's great at it, readily admitting to being intimidated by the fear of being average. \nI've always thought I've had someone looking out for me,\" she says earnestly, cock ing a pretty elfin head. My grandmother passed away when I was 13, and I don't think I could have done all this without someone helping me. I wouldn't say I was destined to do this because that sounds a little over confident, but I'm glad it happened.\" \nIt's a muggy June afternoon in Fort Worth, Indiana, and this extraordinary young woman is busily preparing for an-other sell-out concert. After navigating her own hugely successful Fearless tour around the US, tonight she's sharing the bill with Keith Urban (ie, Mr Nicole Kidman) for a roof-raising hoedown at the city's 70,000 capacity stadium, which looks set to fill as droves of fans, mostly teenage girls, arrive panting and yapping like excitable puppies. Country music is now arguably bigger than ever in the States, but it's fields away from the good old boy\" harndance we Brits have never really taken to. Blended with pop and rock and invested with the kind of narra tive structure that teenagers can believe in, Swift's take on the genre incorporates boys and love and all the possible permutations those two themes throw up. Not exactly Radiohead, but a universal language that needs no translation.\n\"My music is really personal, she coos. 1 write songs about guys and every detail of what happens in a break-up and every tiny intricate detail of a relationship. I thought I would be the only person who could relate to that, but it turned out the opposite. I don't necessarily know why so many people have connected to my music, she adds, a little perplexed. I put out my first album in the US when I was 16, and I thought there was a chance that people would relate to my it-but not that many people!\" \nTo be honest, Swift's success is no over night fluke. She's been preparing for this moment since she was 11 years old, dragging long-supportive mother, Andres, around the karaoke bars and festivals of her native Pennsylvania. Eventually, the family moved west to the outskirts of Nashville, doggedly pursuing their talented daughter's hopes of becoming a country star. In the three years that followed, she was signed to a publish-ing company, wrote songs after school with established artists, and showcased her girl and a guitar routine in late-night bars, all in the hope of being 'discovered. After per sonally dropping demo CDs into every label she could get through the door of, she was finally snapped up at the age of 14 and had her first hit with the song \"Tim McGraw, a reference to the gruff country singer whose tunes reminded her of her first romance. I've always been fascinated by love and human interaction,\" she muses. \"Some of my songs deal with being ignored, some talk about the pain of unrequited feelings. It's all the normal stuff that girls of my age tend to go through.\" \nLast year's public split with Joe Jonas (he dumped her by phone) provided some lyrical bile, and it's this type of teen drama that seems to produce Swift's best work. With love, especially the spurned and difficult variety, being a favourite topic, might she run out of material if she met Mr Right? 'Sometimes I lay awake at night and wonder if I were to stay in a stable relationship. what would I write about? Perhaps I'd still be reminiscing about past experiences and problems. I've never wanted to make an album full of happy songs. I don't think that's ever going to happen. If I met somebody and they were amazing, then I would love to be with them, but I don't go out trolling the award shows looking for my next boyfriend. I can write a song about making eye contact with someone from across the room in three seconds. I don't need a relationship to have good material. \nThere's something slightly disconcerting about Taylor Swift using the word 'troll ing. It somehow doesn't compute with her virginal image. In a sense she is the anti-Britney: she neither smokes nor drinks and radiates both health and happiness, thus appealling to a whole swathe of well brought-up kids and their admiring parents. America has completely embraced her, be-cause in times of uncertainty she appears to represent decency, honesty and the alluring promise of youth. \"That's the nicest thing you could say, she declares, 'but it's never been about me trying to look well-behaved, it's just how I am. I guess it's a weird thing to be 19 and not ever have been drunk, but for me, it just feels normal, because I don't really know any other way. I don't know if I'd be comfortable getting wasted and not knowing what I've said. That doesn't mean when I'm older I won't have a glass of wine. I just don't think it's such a strange thing for me not to be wasted all the time.\" \nOf course, there are those who would love to see the girl who can do no wrong slip up and tarnish that chaste image, but oddly enough. Perez Hilton isn't one of them. Normally, someone like Swift would be an easy target for one of the gossip queen's poison missives, but he has declared his love, pro-claiming her recent tour 'mind-blowingly kick-ass fucking awesome'. Surely, though, it's only a matter of time before she becomes the target of someone's jealousy? 'You can't be paranoid about somebody's actions, like Photoshopping a drink in my hand or some-thing,\" she muses. But you can control your own decisions, and I have a lot of faith. I have people around me that I trust, who will tell me if I am acting out of line. Folks think I have a lot of \"yes\" people around me but that's just not the case.\" \nIt's time for her to go, but before she leaves she's happy to reveal something else: 'My toenails are painted black right now,\" she grins. 'And sometimes I paint them all different colours. I'm making so many major decisions about big things right now my tour, my second album, which songs to put on the deluxe re-release that I don't seem to be able to make little decisions any more. Like, what colour to paint my toenails.\" ",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript & Translation] Stupid sayings and embarrassing moments! Supergirl Taylor Swift doesn't have it easy with her daddy!\n\nShe would prefer to sink into the ground, hide or simply be magically transported away! When Taylor Swift is out and about with her dad Scott, the 19-year-old has to show strong nerves. \"My daddy is totally embarrassing,\" sighs the 1.80 meter tall singer (current single: Love Story\"). From harmless pranks to serious embarrassments - Taylor's dad hardly misses a faux pas. \"Recently we stayed in a hotel. When I came into the breakfast room, he was waving his arms like a madman and yelling: Look here everyone! Here comes superstar Taylor Swift. The people in the room stared at us in amazement.\" But the stockbroker can't just embarrass his famous daughter when he's out and about - Scott also goes full throttle at home in Nashville, Tennessee. Taylor: \"There's a boy from the neighborhood. He thinks I'm cute and always grins at me when we meet. When I was out with Dad recently and met him, Dad hissed at him, \"Hands off! She's already taken with me!\" Oh dear, isn't Taylor fed up with 50 bad jokes? No, quite the opposite!! I love my dad and his funny ways. And as a real Swift, I have to be able to laugh at myself too!\" Well then, have fun, Taylor...\n\nShe is the only blonde among the Hollywood girls. She is a good 15 centimeters taller than the other girls. And at 19, she is also significantly older than her friends. There is no doubt about it: Taylor Swift is something very special - Miley Cyrus (16), Selena Gomez (16) and Demi Lovato (16) know that too. \"I'm a kind of big sister to the girls - the mother of the clique, so to speak,\" laughs Taylor. Whenever they need a shoulder to lean on, I'm there for them. But Tay Tay\" (her nickname) is not only there in difficult situations. \"We have a lot of space. Especially when I'm with Miley, I can hardly stay in my chair from laughing. She's the loudest girl I've ever met. I love her!\", the 1.80 meter tall singer admits. The two girls love going out together to watch DVDs. Grey's Anatomy or shopping. We're totally crazy about ' and, CSI. Sometimes we even watch ten episodes in a row,\" says Taylor. With so many hours spent with Miley on TV, is there still time for Selena and Of course! And if not, Demi? Above all, I see Selena almost every week. then we talk on the phone! We can't live without each other anymore,\" admits Taylor, adding: \"She is so natural and doesn't put on an act. I know a lot of people who are successful and suddenly have their noses in the air. But Selena has kept her feet on the ground.\" And Taylor has also become close friends with Sel's best friend Demi Lovato. I can really rock out with Demi! We are both huge sports fans and like to go to ice hockey together.\" It almost sounds like everything is peace and harmony with the girls. Are there really never any catfights? After all, each of the four fights for their own success in the tough world of show business. And: Miley and Demi must also be chart competitors for Taylor. But she waves it off: No. I don't see the girls as opponents. My only opponent is myself. I am very ambitious, always want to do everything perfectly. That sometimes gets in my own way! And then her friends come into play again: Whenever I get unsure, I call Miley, Demi or Selena. They build me up again, reveals Taylor. They may be three years younger than me, but I can really learn a thing or two from their self-confidence!\"\n\nOriginal German Transcript: \n\nMEIN DAD IST SO PEINLICH! \nTEXT: Juliane Taudt\n\nDumme Sprüche und peinliche Momente! Super- girl Taylor Swift hat's nicht leicht mit ihrem Daddy\n\nSie will am liebsten im Boden S versinken, sich verstecken oder einfach weggezaubert werden! Wenn Taylor Swift mit Ihrem Dad Scott unterwegs ist, muss die 19-Jährige starke Nerven beweisen. Mein Daddy ist total peinlich\", seufzt die 1,80 Meter grofle Sängerin (aktuelle Single: Love Story\"). Von harmlosen Streichen bis hin zu handfesten Blamagen- Taylors Dad lässt kaum ein Fett- näpfchen aus. Neulich über nachteten wir in einem Hotel. Als ich in den Frühstücksraum kam, wedelte er wie ein Verrückter mit\nden Armen und brülita: Schaut alle her! Hier kommt Superstar Taylor Swift. Die Leute im Saal starrten uns entgeistert an.\" Doch nicht nur unterwegs kann der Börsen makler seine be rühmte Tochter in Verlegenheit bringen auch daheim in Nash- ville/Tennessee gibt Scott Voligas. Taylor: \"Es gibt da einen Jungen aus der Nachbar- schaft. Er findet mich sulß und grinst mich ständig an, wenn wir uns begegnen. Als ich vor Kurzem mit Dad unterwegs war und ihn traf, zischte Papa ihm zu, Finger weg! Sie ist schon vergeben an mich! O je hat Tauler von 50 vielen schlechten Scherzen nicht langsam die Nase voll? Nein, Im Gegenteil!! Ich liebe meinen Dad und seine witzige Art Und als echte Swift muss ich auch über mich selbst lachen kannen!\" Na dann Weiterhin viel Spafl, Taylor...\n\nSie ist die einzige Blondine unter den Hollywood- Giris Sie überragt die anderen Mädchen um gut 15 Zentimeter. Und sie ist mit ihren 19 Jahren auch deutlich älter als ihre Freundinnen. Ohne Zweifel: Taylor Swift ist etwas ganz Besonderes das wissen auch Miley Cyrus (16), Selena Gomez (16) und Demi Lovato [16). Für die Mädels bin ich eine Art große Schwester-sozusagen die Mutter der Clique\", lacht Taylor. Immer wenn sie eine Schulter zum Anlehnen brauchen, bin ich für sie da. Doch nicht nur in schwierigen Situationen ist Tay Tay\" (Ihr Spitz- name zur Stelle). \"Wir haben total viel Spall. allem, wenn ich mit Miley zusammen bin, kann ich mich vor Lachen kaum noch auf dem Stuhl halten. Sie ist das lauteste Girl, das ich jemals kennengelernt habe. Ich liebe sie!\", die 1,80 Meter gesteht. große Sängerin. Am ilebsten gehen die beiden Girls zusammen schauen DVDs. Grey's Anatomy shoppen oder Wir sind total verrückt nach ' und, CSI. Manchmal ziehen wir uns sogar zehn Foigen nacheinander rein\", erzählt Taylor. Bleibt bei so vielen Stunden mit Miley varm Fernseher denn noch Zeit für Selena und Natürlich! Vor Und wenn nicht, Demi? allem Selena sehe ich fast jede Woche. dann telefonieren wir! Wir können gar nicht mehr ohne einander\", gesteht Taylor und fügt hinzu: „Sie ist so natürlich und verstellt sich nicht. Ich kenne viele Leute, die erfolgreich sind und plötzlich ihre Nase ganz weit oben tragen. Aber Selena ist auf dem Teppich geblieben\" Und auch mit Sels bester Freundin Demi Lovato verbindet Taulor mittlerweile eine enge Freundschaft. Mit Demi kann ich richtig ab- rocken! Wir beide sind auch Riesen-Sportfans und gehen gern zusammen zum Eishockey.\" Hört sich fastso an, als wäre bei den Girls alles Friede, Freude, Eierkuchen. Gibt es wirklich nie Zicken-Zoff? Immerhin kämpft jede der vier ja im knallharten Show-Business für den eigenen Erfolg Und: Miley und Demi müssten ja für Taylor auch Charts-Konkurrentinnen sein. Doch die winkt ab: Nein. Ich sehe die Girls nicht als Gegne rinnen. Mein einziger Gegner bin ich selbst Ich bin sehr ehrgeizig, will immer alles per fekt machen. Damit steh ich mir manchmal selbst im Weg! Und dann kommen wieder ihre Freundinnen ins Spiel: Immer wenn ich unsicher werde, rufe ich Miley, Demi oder Selena an. Sie bauen mich wieder auf, verrät Taylor. Die sind zwar drei Jahre jünger als ich, doch von ihrem Selbstbewusstsein kann ich echt noch 'ne Scheibe abschneiden!\"",

So I like to take a lot of time and really develop an album and take a year and a half or two years to make an album so that it's not thrown together.\"\n\nSwift is currently working on a new album, the followup to the hugely successful Fearless.  “As soon as I put out my last album, Fearless, the next day I was writing for the next album. So I’m always thinking ahead. I love organizing and planning and getting a theme going for the next record.”",

It’s Borchetta’s third new business venture in less than four years, a bold move at a time when the recording industry is in the midst of a historic contraction.\n\nWhy are you expanding when other labels are trimming back?\n\nUniversal, Monte Lipman in particular, and myself have been trying to find a way to do more business together. He’s been my partner on the top 40/crossover side [for Swift’s records]. I wasn’t looking to take on another label. [But I thought] if I could get somebody that I could trust and that I knew could do the job and who was the right person, then maybe we could combine this momentum and this interest and have another opportunity. So I spoke to Jimmy [Harnen] about it and he’s like, “My God, that is the only move I’d consider making right now.” He was very happy at Capitol. It all came together.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Scott Borchetta & The Remnants\n\nI recently did an interview with Big Machine/Valory Music/Republic Nashville CEO Scott Borchetta that landed in the pages of Billboard and on Billboard.biz. As is the case with many interviews I do, space limits what can actually be published. With that in mind, I offer you, dear reader, the best of the rest of my conversation with Scott—the remnants, if you will.\n\nHow has your role changed since you launched Big Machine in 2005 and what have you learned?\n\nThat’s a great question because it’s become so many different things. When we first started the label, I was really a glorified vice president of promotion. I always had had at least a voice in what acts were doing what, what singles came out, etc., but at the end of the day that was never really just my call.\n\nBut working with [former DreamWorks principal James] Stroud gave me the opportunity to really be involved with all aspects of a label. James really allowed me to learn how to run a record company. Obviously I had to learn a lot more about marketing, learn a lot more about distribution, learn contracts from zero to putting a record out, and that knowledge base has expanded greatly.\n\nBeing involved in the negotiations, being involved in global marketing with all the Universal companies that we work with is fantastic. Obviously we’re involved in different parts of management with different artists. We’re not day-to-day managers of anybody, but we have different strategic consulting management responsibilities.\n\nWe’ve always felt that we always wanted that open door policy. If you can save a new artist heartache, [you should]. It’s about saying, “You shouldn’t do this and this is why. We’ve been here before. This is 20-plus years of experience saying, 'You can try that. Here are two or three things that could happen if you go down that road'.”\n\nAnd when you have new families come in—because it’s very rare when it’s just an artist, especially as we’re delving more and more into younger artists—there’s a lot family involvement. And they don’t know anything coming in.\n\nUntil you’re on the job, there’s no on the job training. And so, whether it’s everything that we’ve gone through with the Swift family or if it’s just a new act that we want to sign that’s a family act that we’re hoping to land literally today. There’s a lot of family involved then. It’s three siblings, and their parents are very involved, and we invite that. Nobody knows their kids better than their parents. So why not use that knowledge base? They’re experts on their kids. So we welcome all that. With Kate & Kacey, their dad, Frank [Coppola], is a very smart man, and so why shouldn’t we have him in the circle of the knowledge base?\n\nThe first act you’ve signed to your new Republic Nashville label is Fast Ryde. What’s the story behind their signing?\n\nI had just gotten back from Australia. I was there for the second week that Taylor was over there. I was in the office Monday, and Harry, my assistant, says, “Hey, Allison,” our VP of A&R “wants you to hear this CD.” I’m like, “Alright, when’s our A&R meeting?” He says, “Thursday.” I’m like, “Alright I got a couple days, right?” So Monday goes by, Tuesday. Thursday I said, “Let me play this. Get ready for Allison. See what she’s got.” And I’m like, “Oh my god.” I played the first song, it’s amazing. Play the second one, “Are you kidding me?” I call her before the meeting, “Why didn’t you break into my office?” She goes, “I tried.” I’m said, “You’re right. Harry told me. You know what, if they can breathe, they’re signed. Get them in here.”\n\nAnd they ended up being these two young, cool guys [James Harrison and Jody Stevens] who have this whole thing going on. It was one of those beautiful situations where something fantastic happened right under your nose.\n\nWe told them “You want to be here. We want you to be here. Let’s go.” We told them about the Republic opportunity. They kind of scratched their head and looked at each other, and then met with [label president] Jimmy [Harnen] and myself together and they said, “Alright. Let’s go.”\n\nYou had several different releases between Taylor’s first album and her second—there was a Christmas record, a Wal-Mart exclusive, a deluxe edition—do you foresee doing different variations again between the second album and her third?\n\nYeah, we will do a “Fearless” deluxe re-release. There will only be one more version of the album, but she has so much music that comes out of her. There are some great songs sitting, and she and I were just talking about this last week. Like, “You know what? ‘Sparks Fly’ is a great song, and if we don’t get to that song, you’ll leave it behind and your fans won’t ever get to own it.” So that’s a song that she’s seriously considering for a deluxe re-release.\n\nThere are three or four or five things sitting that, with as quickly as she’s growing up, if we don’t get ‘em now, they won’t get out. And she acknowledges that. It goes back to the first album conversation. She didn’t really want to put “The Outside” and “A Place In This World” on the first record. I said, “They’re so important and they’re such great songs, if you don’t put them on the first record, we’ll never get to ‘em.” And she was nice enough to go along with me on that and there’s been a couple times where she’s high-fived me. She said, “You know what? I’m glad we put these songs on this record because they made the record so real.”\n\nSo that’s where she is right now. We’ve had a couple things that have happened musically during the “Fearless” campaign that will be part of a “Fearless” deluxe edition and that’s for the fans. We’re not going to shove a million copies of a re-release out there. We’re pretty knowledgeable about what the super fan wants, and so we’re going to make just enough to fulfill that need and desire. Also we very specifically, from day one, established her as a fourth-quarter artist. So there will be people going into the stores in the fourth-quarter saying, “I want to buy a Taylor Swift gift for my daughter/sister/girlfriend/whoever it is.” We’re not going to disappoint.",

      "Transcript/Content": "The best friends: Swimmer sees perks, pitfalls as country star’s confidante\n\nAug 20, 2009 - 12:00am\n\nSarah Henning\n\nWhile Abigail Anderson was looking for an exit, everyone else was looking for an introduction.\n\nOn April 27, Anderson did a very normal thing: She went to class and sat next to her best friend. To a big lecture hall, in fact, where very few know one another by name.\n\nIt’s just that the 400 other students in Chuck Marsh’s Journalism 101 class did know the name of her best friend. As did the hoards of people lining the halls and exits of Budig Hall that day.\n\nTaylor Swift.\n\nWith two records made and millions of albums sold, the 19-year-old country-pop singer has won awards, been nominated for a Grammy and graced the covers of magazines from Allure to Seventeen to Rolling Stone with the sort of smile and honesty that’s so hard to come by, it’s refreshing.\n\nSwift had just performed in Missouri and had decided to take a three-day break to spend time with her best friend and get a taste of the college life in Lawrence. Anderson wanted Swift to experience her favorite class. Chuck Marsh recalls the surreal day.\n\n“I noticed there was a large gentleman sitting in the balcony, and I thought, ‘Oh, OK, somebody’s dad is here, that’s fine.’ And then I noticed two young women sitting in the balcony, and I always like to get the students down in the front, but I thought, ‘Oh, they came in late. I’ll be nice today. I won’t hassle them,'” Marsh said. “Well, it turns out that that was Abigail and Taylor Swift. I didn’t know it, and the large gentleman was Taylor Swift’s bodyguard.”\n\nMeanwhile, the excitement growing outside the classroom was almost as intense as inside. Stephanie Payne, Anderson’s roommate, was also sitting in the class. At one point, she got up to use the restroom. After making her way back to the class through a maze of bodies lining the halls outside the room, she sent Anderson a text message. All it read: “Good luck.”\n\nAnderson didn’t need a warning to feel nervous. She said minutes into the class she was already looking for an exit strategy.\n\n“It’s funny how over the course of, like, an hour class that literally one text message can set off a whole campus,” Anderson said. “I remember sitting in class trying to think of an exit, of how we can do this. And I was writing her and saying, ‘Do you want to do this?’ And she was like, ‘No, it’s OK. We’ll exit the way we entered.'”\n\nThat exit was made only after a Beatlemania-type hysteria that Marsh admitted doesn’t normally hit his classroom.\n\n“As soon as I said, ‘See ya next time’ — I mean there was such a movement to that corner of the room, I turned to the teaching assistant and said, ‘What’s going on?’ and she said, ‘I have no idea.’ The students are running past her going, ‘Taylor Swift’s up there! Taylor Swift’s up there!'” Marsh said.\n\nFame and freshman year\nSo, what is it like being the best friend of a superstar? To have people come up to you on the street, or to meet Justin Timberlake, or head off to college thinking you didn’t know a soul only to have everyone know WHO you are?\n\nWell, to hear Anderson tell it, it’s just life as she knows it.\n\nThe teens met before Swift’s first record dropped, when they were both in the same English class at Hendersonville High School in Nashville, Tenn. As high school freshmen, they became inseparable, but it wasn’t long before the girls got a hint of what life would be like if Swift made the big time. A year after becoming friends, Swift’s music career made it necessary for her to be home-schooled.\n\n“I mean, any girl knows that if your best friend leaves you in 10th grade, it’s just like, ‘OK, what do I do now?’ So, it was hard for both of us,” Anderson said. “I had to kind of make a new name for myself around school, and she had to do her own thing out there and miss everything that had been her life for the previous few years. But she just immediately just started doing so well … you just couldn’t really think about anything else.”\n\nCue the teenage jealousy? Not in the slightest, said Anderson.\n\n“I just remember she called me one night and we had to have the talk about she’s not coming back to school,” Anderson said. “But after that it was just a way of life and we dealt with it, and we’ve actually gotten closer since.”\n\nIn fact, Anderson said, their relationship was built on the foundations of goals both girls had set for themselves. For Swift, it was becoming a recording artist. For Anderson, it was becoming a top-notch swimmer.\n\n“When I was a freshman, I knew I wanted to swim in college, at a Division I school, and she knew that she wanted to go on tour. And it’s just really cool how we both ended up doing that,” said Anderson, who set school records at KU last season on medley relay swimming teams. “After you’ve kind of struggled and actually gone through the journey that you’re talking about making, when you look back on it, it’s interesting to see that you actually did do the things that you really wanted to do.”\n\nBut that doesn’t mean that the star doesn’t look at Anderson’s life and wonder, “what if?” Immediately after her trip to Lawrence, Swift headed to Chicago for an Oprah appearance and gushed in a video on Oprah.com about the town and college life, saying: “My perfect day off would be going to visit my best friend Abigail in Lawrence, Kan. She goes to Kansas University, so, um, basically that’s my best friend since I was 15, and I love going to visit her. So, it’s this little college town and it’s kind of fun because you always kind of wonder about the path you didn’t take and the path I didn’t take was going to college, so, um, when I have days off, I like to go and visit Abigail and kind of experience college without actually having to take tests and study.”\n\nGrateful\nSwift’s journey has touched Anderson along the way. Not only has she had the cooler perks of being featured in a song (“Fifteen”), a music video (“Picture to Burn”) and on television shows like “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” she’s also had to deal with the downsides. Fanatics have showed up at her dorm room looking for her, made fake MySpace and Facebook accounts and even posted pictures of her and her boyfriend on Twitter, pretending, Anderson said, to be her.\n\nBut she said she wouldn’t trade how things turned out for a more normal experience or a different best friend. She’s not naive to the fact that though her best friend can’t come to her swim meets — “People were missing their events to try and get her autograph, and she felt so bad,” Anderson said of Swift’s last swim meet appearance — she gets a taste of the kind of life most only dream of, even if it means being cornered in class.\n\n“I’m just grateful that she wants people to also be there with her,” Anderson said. “She’s not the type of person who’s just ‘me, me, me,’ she wants her friends to partake in it, she wants everybody to be there. I’m just grateful that I’m the one that she chooses.”",

What was it like working with her?\n\nMartin: She's awesome. She's one of the most talented songwriters to work with, if not, the best. For such a young girl, she's so creative and spot-on. She knows the audience, she truly understands the kind of pop music that is from the heart and done in a tasteful way. She knows ways to make things pop and also make you feel it at the same time. We wrote a bunch of songs together and it was a lot of fun.\n\nJohn actually got a chance to play on her record Fearless, on the song \"You're Not Sorry\" and it just seemed totally perfect when it was time to do \"Two is Better Than One.\" The track was missing something - that female voice, that call and respond sort of thing, to really show what the song was about - that two is better than one. And Taylor was obviously the first choice for that natural, beautiful voice and we really wanted her to be on it.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Artist Of The Year: Taylor Swift\nThe country superstar talks about writing her name in the record books and life on the road -- and gives a sneak peek at her next album.\n\nBy Bill Werde \n\n12/10/2009\n\nDo you have a single favorite moment from the past year?\nThe high moment of this year was my Fearless tour. Every night of that tour felt like a celebration. I never expected it to be as successful as it was.\n\nAnd what about a low point?\n[Pauses] I’ve had a few days — and everyone has them — where you feel humiliated or you’re shocked by something or something knocks you down a few pegs. But in those moments I’ve been very quick to realize and remind myself that there are people out there with real problems. To get hung up on any bad moment that happened this year would be unfair to all the good moments I’ve had this year.\n\nAre there careers that came before you that you tried to learn from?\nWhen I was growing up I didn’t watch much kid television. When I was 10 I watched a special on Faith Hill and how she went to Nashville and made it in country music. I watched how Garth Brooks kept his ticket prices low. I watched how Shania Twain was able to be a blend of different genres. I just love what I get to do so much that there’s never a moment of my day when I’m not thinking about a certain aspect of it, and there’s never a point when I feel like I know all I need to know about the music industry.\n\nHave you had time to write amid all this craziness?\nI actually am best writing on the road. I only have time to write the songs that hit me the hardest. Those are songs like “Fifteen” — that’s one I wrote on the road. It hits me and I needed to write it so I found time to write it, whether it’s 15 minutes between meet-and-greets or at 4 a.m. If they haunt me throughout my meet-and-greets and interviews, and all I’m playing in my head is this song, then I know I’ve got something.\n\nI’m well into writing my next album. I think my biggest goal for this next record is to write in real time as I always have. I want to continue to write about things that I’m going through. My first record was my diary from my early teens. My next was my diary from 16 to 18. My biggest hope for this next record is that the feelings I’m feeling right now will be accurately portrayed.\n\nSo what’s left for you now? Will we see an album next year?\nMy next goals are to continue on with the Fearless tour. I’d love to be able to perform on the Grammys again. They gave me a unique opportunity last year to perform a song I hadn’t even released as a single. Obviously I’ll be making my third record. I’ll be taking time to make it everything I’ve got dreamed up in my head so far. I like to have about two years between records — so possibly next year.",

Those are definitely going to be the good memories that I focus on when I need a pick-me-up, or just to go back and reminisce on something that I can’t believe happened to me.”\n\n Related\nSabrina Carpenter performs on stage during the Short N' Sweet Tour held at Madison Square Garden on September 29, 2024 in New York City.\nSabrina Carpenter, Hozier, Doja Cat, Luke Combs and The Strokes Headlining 2025 Austin City Limits…\n05/06/2025\nEven with her awards, stardom, and fan alliances (especially thanks to a certain VMA incident) growing, Swift says she’s making sure to stay grounded. “I never want to get to the point where success and nominations and things like that ever seem just like something that happens every day,” the singer explains. “I was brought up by two parents who taught me that the world doesn’t owe you anything. You have to work for everything you get and you have to be appreciative of every bit of success that the world gives you.”\n\n\nSwfit adds, “I remember driving the streets of my hometown in Hendersonville, Tennessee when I was 14 — the same streets that I drive now — and back then my life was so different. The things that I’m doing now were only things that I could dream about.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Calls\nTwice.  From London.\n\nFirst time I was in the shower.  When I listened to the message toweling off, I thought she said \"Erica\".  Listening again it was clear it was Ms. Swift, who sounded troubled, like there’d been a misunderstanding involving love.  And maybe that’s the case.  She felt I loved her, had I turned against her?\n\nThat’s what she said when we finally spoke.  That she thought I got her.  And it frustrated her to think that I believed she used auto-tune.\n\nShe denied it.  Emphatically.  As only as a nineteen year old can.  I believed her.  But it still didn’t address the underlying issue.  Could she sing?  Exactly how good a singer was she?\n\nI told her I couldn’t talk right now.  That I was rushing out to a doctor’s appointment.  If she wanted, we could speak about two hours hence, when I came back.  But there was the eight hour time difference, and the day was evaporating.  Although she’d left me her cell phone number, unfortunately one digit eaten by the machine, I told her to e-mail me with her address, and as soon as I got home I’d let her know, we could talk.\n\nBut then doing the math, worried we’d be unable to connect, having to get up early to do interviews, Taylor got into it.  How she didn’t even know how to use auto-tune, had never used it.  Then again, she admitted to fixing some mistakes in the studio.\n\nThen I asked her, what about those high-priced concert tickets online?  What was going on there?  I’d printed an e-mail saying in Philadelphia that tickets were going for far in excess of a hundred bucks and then, within minutes of my publishing said letter, the whole tour page disappeared online, replaced with dates that had already played as opposed to those coming up.\n\nShe told me she had no idea.  She’d have to check into it.  And I ran out of my house and got behind the wheel.\n\nThis was not the first contact I’d received from her camp.  I’d gotten a long e-mail from her father.  Not histrionic, not criticizing me, but also emphatically denying she’d been auto-tuned live.  That was off the record, but now since his daughter has weighed in…\n\nAnd maybe that was true.  Because she was so horrible in the opening of the CMAs.  Oh, that’s a strong word to use.  It’s just that she was so far from perfect, anywhere but on the note, on pitch.  She was definitely naked there.\n\nAs she was during the first song on SNL.  Not the opening segment, wherein Taylor said, like many writers to me opined, that she was trying to imitate Phoebe from \"Friends\", but the full band number.  She wasn’t quite as bad as she was on the CMAs, but she was not up to the level of a professional.  The second song was better, but the backup vocals were covering up quite a bit.\n\nSo, like I said.  Even if she didn’t use auto-tune, there was still the underlying issue, could she sing?  She admitted fixing things on record…\n\nThen, after my appointment, I got an e-mail from the guy who leases the audio equipment for her tour, one Everett Lybolt, GM of Sound Image.  This was pushing me over the edge. They protesteth too much!  Furthermore, Mr. Lybolt went on to criticize other performers on the CMAs for not being live.\n\nWho the fuck knows.\n\nTaylor said I could come to the gig, check all her equipment out.\n\nLike I’m really going to do that.  Like it would prove anything.  And I never wanted to be a member of the CIA.\n\nAnd then I get home to a hanging tag from FedEx.  My new laptop has finally arrived from China.  I missed the delivery by fifteen minutes.  I call the delivery service, asking for a resend, and while I’m being transferred between operators, another person is looking for me.  But they hang up, then ring again.  It’s Taylor.  Who I tell to hold.\n\nThis was unexpected.  I figured she’d accomplished her mission.\n\nBut she wanted to get back to me with information on the tour dates.  As a reader had informed me, the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia does not use Ticketmaster, Comcast sells the tickets.  And isn’t it funny now that Comcast has joined the Ticketmaster/Live Nation clusterfuck, with Irving supposedly offloading assets to the Roberts-controlled venture so the merger can go through.\n\nTaylor told me her site had been hacked.  That the link should have been to comcasttix.com.  But the hackers had redirected buyers to gotthetix.com.  That’s why ducats for her show were priced far in excess of a hundred dollars.  She implied that this had been discovered days ago, but in any event, she said it had now been fixed. Anyway, if you go back to her tour page now, the spring dates have reappeared.  With Philadelphia and most other markets being shown as being sold out.\n\nThe truth?\n\nWho the fuck knows.\n\nBut there’s your story.\n\nBut what about our earlier conversation.  About Taylor’s singing?\n\nI told her she was quite good in the skits on SNL.  And she was.  Best non-actor guest host in recent times.  But I told her, like that CMA opening, the first song…her voice was not good.\n\nTaylor laughed.  Said she could handle being criticized for having a bad voice, for missing notes.  But she couldn’t live with being criticized for being inauthentic.\n\nThose songs are written in real time.  About real people.  Her cowriters edit more than contribute.  Her next album she’s not planning to write with anyone.  Not now, anyway.\n\nAnd speaking of collaboration, she said she’s got no manager.  That she and her team have weekly meetings, where they go over career details.  If she’s on the road, she’s conferenced in.  The decisions are hers.\n\nLike playing Gillette Stadium?\n\nAbsolutely.  It’s something she always wanted to do.  She figures she’ll do two or three stadium gigs next summer, that’s all.  She’s salivating over building the show, deciding who will appear with her.\n\nAs for SNL, the call came through William Morris.  They phoned and told her to hold for Lorne Michaels.  Her heart was palpitating, she didn’t figure it was about hosting SNL, and when she got the word, she was flying.\n\nThen we discussed her career.  And music.\n\nI felt I was getting some stock answers.  As I listened, I put myself in her shoes, wondered what it must feel like to get asked the same damn thing again and again.  But I wanted to know.  Did she see herself as a singer, an actress or..?\n\nDefinitely a singer.  With a body of work that delineated the various periods of her life. Her first album was about being 13-16.  Her second…\n\nSo I asked her what her favorite album was.  Not because I was making a list, but because I wanted to know where she was coming from.\n\nShe thought for a moment, then said Shania Twain’s \"Come On Over\".\n\nI said Mutt Lange was the best living record producer, a true master.  But had she ever listened to Joni Mitchell?\n\nThere was some hesitation.  Then Taylor said no.\n\nI told her to buy \"Blue\" tonight.  Quoted her some lines from \"A Case Of  You\".\n\nAnd quoting that classic number, I went on to recite lines from Jackson Browne’s \"The Late Show\".  Told her I didn’t want to overload her, but she should buy \"Late For The Sky\" too.\n\nTaylor told me she’d seen Jackson live acoustic.\n\nI guess I wanted to know if Taylor Swift wanted to be a star or an artist.  That’s why I wanted to know her favorite album, I wanted to know her hopes and dreams.  Did she need to be in the spotlight, or was it about the work, testing limits?\n\nShe’s the one who’s got to figure it out.\n\nRight now, she’s the biggest star in America.  Trumping U2, Springsteen, even Kenny Chesney and the Stones.  And it’s all based on these songs.  Straight from the heart. That’s why the little girls relate.\n\nOne day those girls will be women.  A cusp where Taylor Swift is presently residing.  Will she make the wrong choices?\n\nI told her you can’t say yes to everything.  You can make some mistakes, but too many wrong steps can crimp your career.\n\nThen again, I’m fifty six and she’s nineteen.  Growing up is about taking chances, making mistakes.  But I didn’t want her to listen to oldsters, telling her what to do, telling her it didn’t make any difference as they skimmed from her pond.\n\nWe talked about Louis Messina and American Express.  This was not some backwoods bimbo, an uneducated nitwit who was clueless when it came to business, but she knew only so much of the inner workings.  But that which she did speak about she had a command of.  When I broke new ground, she could follow.  Taylor Swift is smart.\n\nSo where does that leave us?\n\nDid Taylor Swift work me?\n\nI’ve been worked before.  I recognize it when I see it.  Tommy Lee insisting I print his e-mail before he responds again.  He was looking for publicity.  Taylor seemed to need set the record straight.  For herself.\n\nThen again, there’s an entire career in the balance.\n\nBut songs trump singing all day long.  Anybody can sing, especially in this auto-tune era. But being able to write a great song, one that grabs fans lyrically and melodically, that’s truly tough.  And Taylor Swift has accomplished that.\n\nSo, I’m a huge fan of the albums.\n\nAnd I’m convinced she’s vocally challenged.  But the way Taylor handled that in our conversation, by not skipping a beat, by admitting she’s less than perfect, that she can handle the criticism, won me over.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: ELLE's April cover girl on media scrutiny, her fears, and those revealing lyrics\nTucked away in a quiet corner of a clamorous steak house in midtown Manhattan, at a safe remove from the pin-striped after-work crowd, Taylor Swift hunches over a notepad and contemplates her future. At the top of the page are four letters, M-A-S-H, denoting four categories of real estate: mansion, apartment, shack, and house.\n\nPretty much everyone under 35, especially the slumber party set, knows the game—everyone except Swift, who, although still technically a teen (turning 20 three days after we meet) and perhaps the most effective apostle of adolescence since Frankie Avalon, is not exactly representative of the species. \"I think I've definitely played it before,\" she says. \"It's been awhile, though.\"\n\nIn person, Swift's beauty is almost otherworldly. Tall and whiplike in a red cashmere sweater from Topshop, black Citizens of Humanity jeans, and Rag & Bone flats, all of it topped off with that cascade of corkscrew curls, she appears almost suffused with light, like a stage performer pursued by a follow spot. Her manner is girlish, but she's also extraordinarily self-possessed. She speaks in well-constructed sentences, pausing first to formulate her thoughts and unfailingly weaving the question she's been asked into her response the way media coaches recommend. And she's generous with hugs, which she tends to deliver sideways like a tall person (she's 5'11\") who poses for a lot of photos. Al Wilson, her drummer and bandleader, met her three years ago and remains awestruck. \"She just glows,\" he says, shaking his head like someone trying to describe a UFO. \"She has an electricity that's just profound, man. She's wired so well it's unbelievable.\" (According to her best friend from back home in Tennessee, Abigail Anderson, Swift does have one teensy fault—an annoying tendency to clear her throat a lot— though to be fair, nobody else seems to have noticed.)\n\nReturning to our attempt at junior varsity fortune-telling, the singer-songwriter is asked to name three cities she'd like to live in and fires off Nashville, New York, and Los Angeles. But when it comes to citing one she'd hate, Swift hesitates. The last thing she wants to do is snub some random municipality in a national magazine. She settles on the perfect answer: \"Kablamphnar,\" which doesn't actually exist. I jot it all down, along with four numbers representing how many children she might eventually have.\n\nNow for the tough part: Three guys you think are hot?\n\n\"Like, how do you mean?\" she asks, scrunching up her face. She knows how I mean. \"Um, well...Taylor Lautner,\" she says finally, a certain nervy resolve in her voice. The 18-year-old Lautner, the other half of what the tabloids dubbed \"Taylor Squared,\" is the impish, abdominally gifted New Moon hunk who has played her beau onscreen (in the romantic comedy Valentine's Day) and off. She joked about the relationship in a charming Saturday Night Live monologue—her appearance, as both host and musical guest, was SNL's best-rated episode last fall, until, that is, Lautner hosted the show and reciprocated with a Taylor shout-out of his own. During our interview, she declines to chat about him at all, and wisely so: A few weeks later she cuts him loose, and a member of her camp makes sure Us Weekly has the proper spin.\n\nBack to the game: Swift name-checks John Mayer and Carter Jenkins, another Valentine's Day costar, as her remaining hotties. I don't even bother to solicit a response to the last question: a guy she can't stand. I just write Kanye West.\n\n\"Oh my God, no you didn't!\" she says, her almond-shaped eyes glinting a bit. \"You're so scandalous. Do we have to?\"\n\nRelax, it's just a game, I tell her.\n\n\"Mmm, right,\" she says skeptically.\n\nYou can't blame Swift for being cautious; the girl's got a lot to lose. Her second album, Fearless, was 2009's best-selling in any genre, sticking to its No. 1 perch on Billboard's Top 200 for 11 weeks, longer than any album in a decade. Her first record is still among the top 100 three years after its release. Then there are the awards, including her 2010 Grammy wins—Best Album of the Year plus three more—last year's infamous Moonman for Best Female Video, and other shiny trinkets too numerous to mention. Though she's been embraced by the country greats, last year becoming the youngest recipient ever to be named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association, many tracks on Fearless could be characterized as soft rock or pop. Nonetheless, \"she's not going to be chasing pop music,\" insists Scott Borchetta, who signed Swift to a deal at his then-fledgling label, Big Machine Records, in 2005. \"Pop music is chasing her.\"\n\nThe day after our dinner, Swift headlines the Z100 Jingle Ball, an annual concert at Madison Square Garden featuring a bevy of tween-friendly acts. It's late, and some fans are looking blearyeyed, out well past their bedtimes. Justin Bieber, the mop-topped hormonal heartthrob, has just delivered a rousing set, appearing in a leg cast (defying doctors' orders—or so he claims, to a chorus of \"Awww...\"), and it seems a tough act to follow. But then Swift appears, skipping across the stage in black knee-high boots, belting out \"You Belong With Me,\" and Bieber is forgotten. Within seconds, the only thing shinier than Swift's spangled Jenny Packham dress is the thousands of glinting braces in the audience as her fans, some weeping, sing along to every word. After the song, Swift stands there for a generous while, smiling radiantly, her slender arms outstretched, just sort of marinating in it. A minute or so goes by and, just when our palms are beginning to sting, she gooses the applause with the merest side-flick of her electric blue eyes and stands there some more.\nAs talented a performer as she is, it's Swift's genius as a songwriter that's made her a star. Tales of unrequited crushes and teenage yearning, her pastel-color country-pop lullabies are, for the most part, stripped of grown-up temptations. Cozy, enveloping, and altogether irresistible, they're a perfect balm for a time when we seem to have run out the string on cynicism. Not merely innocent, they reaffirm the whole idea of innocence, transforming youthful naïveté from a fleeting embarrassment into an exalted Paradise Lost, and scattering bread crumbs you can follow all the way home, if you're willing. Approach a song such as \"Love Story\" or \"Fifteen\" with an open heart—playing it loud, over headphones, say, while running through the park at dawn—and the impact is so redemptive and affecting and true, you might be moved to wonder why you ever grew up at all.\n\nNot for nothing has Swift been tagged the \"anti-Britney.\" Whereas that other precocious blond songstress insisted she was \"not that innocent,\" and then went on to prove it every way she could, Swift is a veritable Girl Scout. \"Taylor's the perfect person for this media moment,\" Borchetta notes. \"She really is the girl next door. She hasn't been drunk at a party, hasn't been in any crazy photographs. In this moment of total madness in the culture, Taylor's fans know they can count on her.\" Whatever experiences she's forsworn, Swift is somehow more composed and sophisticated than people many years her senior. Adds Borchetta: \"I think parents just go, Oh, thank God my kids love Taylor Swift.\"\n\nThe singer—a committed teetotaler who likes to joke about her cookie-baking habit and is about to come out with her own line of greeting cards (there will be kittens, she promises, and glitter)— takes her role seriously. One of her biggest fears involves \"me making a bunch of bad decisions and embarking on a painful, slow, devastating tailspin,\" says Swift, who discovered VH1's Behind the Music and E! True Hollywood Story as a child and remains a diligent student of the genre.\n\nAsked to name the biggest mistake she's ever made, the only thing she can come up with is forgetting to scribble any diary entries during her week of SNL rehearsals. Still, she insists, \"I've had countless opportunities to do some really bad things.\" Let's say she chose to hang out with the wrong people, Swift explains. They might influence her to make a bad decision, which would then hit the tabloids. \"And then people start combing through everything that I do trying to find the next mistake and misperception,\" she goes on, clutching her sweater sleeves with her long fingers and pressing her fists together under her chin, \"which leads to more scrutiny. Like, if I go to a bar, even if I'm not drinking, who's to say that a source isn't going to say that I was doing something I shouldn't have been doing? So it's not only about your own moral compass, but the moral compasses of other people that you don't know.\" She pauses, noticing my dumbfounded expression. \"You're thinking, `This is a giant boatload of fear.' \" (I am, especially for someone whose record is called Fearless.) \"But as you can see,\" she adds, \"I overthink everything. I overanalyze everything.\"\n\nFortunately, that analysis tends to demonstrate a Vulcan-like shrewdness. \"Taylor's a very rational person,\" her mother, Andrea, tells me. \"I was definitely crazier than she is. I know I had my first drink before I was 18. But it's not like she's really tempted. Her mind doesn't go there.\"\n\nThis spring, Swift will have more treacherous temptations to contend with when she moves out of her parents' house and into her own place, a three-bedroom condominium in a Nashville highrise. It's just a 15-minute drive away from home, but still. \"Living by yourself, I mean, think about it—there's danger,\" Andrea says, conjuring a horrific scene out of a Final Destination sequel. \"There's stepping in water and hitting the light switch. There's a bathtub overflowing. Just the whole safety issue....\"\n\nPerhaps most frightening of all, Swift might get stuck in her birdcage. In addition to a Juliet Capulet–style balcony overlooking the living room, the singer—who's doing her own interior decorating—has conjured up a chill-out lounge housed in a giant birdcage that will dominate the great room. The only way to reach it, she notes excitedly, is by crossing a pond via a strategically placed stepping stone and climbing a spiral staircase. \"I just wanted it to be my fantasy world,\" she says.\n\nSwift is a fan of fairy tales, and it's not hard to see why. Doted on by loving parents (father Scott is a stockbroker, Andrea a former marketing exec for mutual funds, who ditched her career to raise Taylor and her younger brother, Austin), she grew up on a farm in rural Pennsylvania. \"Taylor's favorite thing to do was saddle up the pony for a trail ride or build a fort in the hay loft,\" Andrea says. She discovered country music at age six and began playing local events and karaoke contests while still in grade school. Then, after catching a documentary about Faith Hill, she begged her parents to take her on a trip to Nashville. \"I just got it into my head that there was this magical place that I needed to go to because that was where dreams come true,\" Swift says. It's become country music legend now, the way a preadolescent Swift marched into one label after another along the famed Music Row (while Andrea waited in the car with Austin) presenting her homemade demo tapes.\nLike every fairy tale, this one has a villain—a posse of them, actually. One day shortly after Taylor, then 12, played her biggest gig yet (singing the National Anthem at a 76ers game), she called her friends one by one, looking for someone to go with her to the local mall. No one could make it, so Taylor went with Mom. Andrea remembers what happened next \"like yesterday,\" she says. \"Taylor and I walked into a store, and these six little girls who had all claimed to be `really busy' were all there together.\n\n\"As a parent, there's no greater pain than watching your child being rejected by her peers,\" Andrea says. \"But it made me realize, if she was ready to sacrifice being accepted and having friends for the lonely experience of writing songs in her bedroom and singing on weekends, it must mean a lot to her.\" A year later, the Swifts were bound for the Nashville exurb of Hendersonville, and at 14, Taylor had inked a deal as a staff songwriter at Sony/ATV publishing.\n\nSwift later wrote a song about that trip to the mall, and I defy any parent to listen to \"The Best Day\" without reaching for a Kleenex (the way Andrea does every night when Taylor plays it on tour). Which points up one of the great ironies about Swift's lyrical output: The girl doesn't so much employ romantic clichés as cherish them like a collection of plastic ponies; yet even her dreamiest love songs are actually tethered to her own life experience (names unchanged to punish the guilty). And despite having had just three boyfriends (including, most notably, Joe Jonas), Swift seems in no danger of running out of material. \"I like to categorize the various levels of heartbreak,\" she says, explaining that it ranges from level one, a simple letdown, to level ten, total heartbreak. \"I've only had that happen once,\" she says. \"A letdown is worth a few songs. A heartbreak is worth a few albums.\"\n\nPretty much everyone who knows Swift says the same thing: What you see is what you get. They mean it in a good way: She's not hiding anything. It's all out there, on her sleeve, in her songs, her videos, status updates, Twitter feed. (Sample Tweet: \"Just wrapped up a cereal party with my mom and dad at the kitchen table. What a night.\" Which manages to be at once homey, self-deprecating, and perfectly on-brand, with 53 characters to spare.) Her YouTube channel includes footage of her getting fitted for a retainer.\n\nOrthodontia aside, though, Swift is no ingenue. Whereas most recording artists have managers who guide their careers—and take 20 percent off the top—Taylor makes all the major strategic decisions herself. \"We were looking around for a manager for awhile, and we realized, Wait a minute—it's her,\" Andrea says. \"She knows exactly what she's doing and exactly who she is, and all we have to do is facilitate her ideas.\" Asked if she ever worries about how Swift might grapple with the extraordinary fame that's now coming her way, Mom says, \"I used to wonder about that, but I got an answer early on. She never talked about fame or money. It was always, `What do I have to do today to get to tomorrow?' She's very evenkeeled. I feel confident that she has the temperament for it.\"\n\nIt's a sign of Swift's media savvy and sophistication as an artist that despite her considered approach to fame, she's not afraid to take risks, from her choice of cover songs (Eminem's \"Lose Yourself,\" Rihanna's \"Umbrella\") and penchant for pranks (dressing up as Kiss's Ace Frehley during a show to punk Keith Urban) to her willingness to poke fun at her image, as she did in a sketch aired during the 2009 CMT Music Awards, rapping with T-Pain (sample rhyme: \"I'm so gangster you can find me baking cookies at night / You out clubbing but I just made caramel delight\").\n\nThat boldness, Borchetta says, paid big dividends during Swift's early days on \"radio tour,\" driving from town to town, playing her songs acoustically for program directors around the country. \"I told her, `They don't like to put new artists right on the air,' \" he recalls. To which Swift replied, \"Then that's the goal, isn't it?\" Thereafter, every time a programmer complimented her music, she'd suggest an impromptu live broadcast. \"I mean, checkmate,\" Borchetta marvels. \"It was so adorable, you couldn't say no. It was deadly.\"\n\nA few years on, the victims of Swift's lethal charm are piled up like cordwood, and she's just getting started. Next on the agenda: a valedictory second lap of the U.S. for the Fearless tour, releasing her greeting card line, reading the scripts that have been piling up since her SNL performance, and working on a new album. And when time allows, she'll hang out with Abigail in that giant birdcage.\n\nAnd then? If M-A-S-H is any guide, she'll get married, move to an apartment in Los Angeles, and have 13 kids. Note to Carter Jenkins: Congrats, dude. Treat her well.",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Taylor’s Time: Catching Up With Taylor Swift\nSinger-songwriter reflects on her big year (rapping! Grammy nods!) and previews 2010\n\nBy Austin Scaggs \nIn a hilariously candid interview in our current issue, Taylor Swift opens up about her Shakira impression and the koi pond she’s building in her new apartment. Here’s more from the Q&A that you won’t find in the magazine: Swift on her love of John Mayer, bling and last-minute song-writing binges.\n\nHow did you spend the holidays?\nI was back in Nashville, and it was pretty cool — my brother’s leaving for college next year and I’m moving out in a few months, so this was sort of a moment in time for me, I was definitely recording all of it in my mind, the last Christmas with all of us being in the same place.\n\nWhere were you when the ball dropped on New Year’s Eve?\nI was texting Hayley [Williams, of Paramore] to let her know I got home from dinner, and that my paranoid thoughts of getting in a car wreck were unwarranted. So I think I texted her something like, “Don’t worry about me, I’m not dead,” and I looked at the clock and it was midnight. So I actually got to experience looking at the clock when it struck midnight, and that was a really fun moment for me, it was the most unconventional New Year’s Eve I’ve ever had.\n\nAlso, my brother had a party, and I walked through and I said hello. A lot of the kids were in my video for “You Belong With Me,” because I shot my video for that song at Pope John Paul High School. When I’m playing the mean girl cheerleader and I’m flirting with some other guy on the football field, that other guy is just one of my brother’s friends.\n\nCan you tell me about any of the influences we might hear on your next record?\nI’m always going to love Keith Urban, I’m always going to love John Mayer. I’m always going to love people like that, who I feel are truly authentic, and that’s not to say that my music will ever sound like theirs, but I’m inspired by people who I feel know exactly who they are, and that inspires me to continue to figure out and inform who I am as an artist.\n\nWhat I was getting at was when are you going to start rapping? I thought T-Sweezy was one of the highlights of 2009.\nDid you really? [Laughs] The CMT Awards asked me, “Do you want to be a part of our intro?” and one of the first things that came to my mind was that I really, really want some excuse to be able to rap and go to the mall and go to those kiosk things and go buy bling and experience rapping in front of a car with spinners for the first time. T-Pain agreed to it and flew to Nashville and we were in a sweltering hot, 95-degree parking garage for an entire day shooting — I will never, ever forget that memory.\n\n\nRelated\nDrake on Centre CourtWimbledon Tennis Championships, Day 8, The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, London, UK - 10 Jul 2018\nOn the Charts: Drake’s ‘Scorpion’ Leads Quiet Week With Third Straight Number One\nWatch Kraftwerk Perform ‘Spacelab’ Live With In-Orbit Astronaut\n[Cont. from 1]\n\nI’m inspired by all kinds of different sounds, and I don’t think I’d ever be someone who would say, “I will never make a song that sounds a certain way, I will never branch outside of genres,” because I think genres are sort of unnecessary walls. I’ve been really lucky to have experienced that firsthand, with people taking down those walls for me little by little — I’ve been very lucky that country radio and pop radio have both been so wonderful to me. But when I hear a great song, I can’t help but be inspired by it, regardless of whatever genre that song falls under.\n\nTell me about your Grammy predictions, what do you think is going to happen?\nI predict that I will be there. I’m planning on performing, and that’s really all that I can predict. You never know what’s going to happen. I like being nominated for eight, I’m not going to lie. I like that feeling. It makes me smile. All I know is that I’m a really, really happy person, thinking about being nominated for eight of them, and I think that’s a gift in itself, so we’ll see what happens in L.A.\n\nWhat’s the status of the next album, are you talking about getting it out this year?\nI like to have two years in between albums, so if you take Fearless and go forward two years, that’s my ideal place to put out the next record, because I think two years of growth and development and feelings and life intake, love intake, emotion output, is my preferred formula for albums right now.\n\nDoes that mean now that you’re 20, you’re done writing for that last album, is it that strict?\nAbsolutely not, I write as life happens to me, and I’m writing so much lately. It’s been crazy. So I think that it’s fun making an album, knowing that two days before you’re scheduled to have the last master in, and everything finished, and they’re about to go print up the booklets, I can write something, call up my producer, we can get in the studio, put a rush on it, get an overnight mix, and that can be a last-minute addition to the record. I’ve had that happen on both my first and second album, the last minute, 11th hour songs.\n\n\nThat was “Love Story,” right?\n“Love Story” wasn’t technically the last one, but it was very, very last minute. The two songs that were completely last minute were, on the first record, “Should Have Said No,” and on the second album, “Forever and Always.” Both of them had to do with something really, really dramatic and crazy happening to me and me needing to address it in the form of music.",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Is Taylor being set up to fail?\nAs Taylor gets more successful, people keep bringing her down.\n\nThis past year has been a fairy tale for Taylor. She's the T reigning princess of the music world and had the best year of her life-her CD Fearless went five times platinum and she sold out her first headlining tour. On top of that, she also won countless awards including four Country Music Awards, five American Music Awards, and four Gram- mys. Even though she was on a roll, each of her acceptance speeches showed a humbled and appreciative Taylor. \"Thank you for letting me accept my impossible dream,\" she said after winning a Grammy. But as Taylor's dream kept skyrocketing, so did the rumor mill-critics began to doubt her talent by saying her tunes \"completely miss the point,\" make up crazy rumors like she can slap together a song in three seconds, and the biggest diss of all, calling her talent \"bad.\" Instead of getting praised for all of her success, Taylor's accolades started causing people to turn on her. But Taylor's not letting them get away with it. \"I'm just going to continue\n\n\"I'm gonna make mistakes\"\nWith people calling Taylor \"annoying\"-something she also heard from her classmates as a kid-it's hard for her to not start believing that there's some truth behind the harsh criticism. \"I'm gonna make mistakes in my life. I realize that,\" she says. One mistake that was amplified around the world was on Taylor's recent trip to Australia, where she fed wild possums at a local park. Animal lover Taylor only had the best intentions, but she was blasted by the wildlife authorities because she \"disrupted their natural behavior.\" Not letting the crazy story get to her, Taylor knows that people will find any reason to point out one of her \"faults.\" \"I feel like I disappoint people sometimes because I'm not edgy enough.\" Critics also took a jab at Taylor for sounding \"badly off key\" during her performance at the Grammys. Some even said they \"cringed.\" In reality. Taylor was having issues hearing the music on stage. \"That's just part of live TV,\" says her record label CEO Scott Borchetta in Taylor's defense.\n\n\"I don't search out headlines\"\nTaylor tries to stay clear of any negativity. \"I don't search out headlines for myself,\" she says. But at times, avoiding mentions of her name is impossible especially at one of her favorite places, the grocery store, where her face is often on the cover of tabloids. \"That's always sort of a strange moment for me,\" Taylor reveals. \"I'll scan through 'em. It's just kind of funny.\" Not taking things too seriously is important to Taylor-and it's that attitude that helps her stay sane through the harsh words. \"When someone writes something about me that's not true, I just try to look at it like it's funny.\"\n\n\"You can stay the same\"\nAs Taylor continues her crazy ride through fame, instead of the haters throwing her off track, she's using their words as fuel to do even better. \"There's something so motivating to me about the pressure looming over whether I'd be able to repeat what I've done,\" she says. People may be trying to find all the negatives in Taylor - but she's ignoring them and staying positive and true to herself.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Living 'Fearless' Taylor Swift talks about her whirlwind rise to the top\nPublished: Friday, March 26, 2010\n\nBy GARY GRAFF\nOf The Oakland Press\nIt’s been a, well, swift, rise for young Taylor Swift.\n\nSince releasing her first album in 2006 at age 17, she’s unleashed two multi-platinum monsters that have sold more than 13 million copies worldwide, logged 11 Top 40 hits and 10 Top 10 country singles, was Billboard magazine’s Artist of the Year for 2009 and is the top-selling digital artist in history with more than 25 million downloads. She was No. 21 on Billboard’s Money Makers list with more than $17 million in 2009, and No. 69 on Forbes magazine’s most powerful celebrities list.\n\nAdd to that films — including “Hannah Montana: The Movie” and “Valentine’s Day” — a CMT Crossroads collaboration with Def Leppard and armloads of trophies from the Academy of Country Music (three), the Country Music Association (six, with four more nominations for this year’s ceremony in April), Country Music Television (five), the Grammy Awards (four) and the American Music Awards (six), and you have a career that’s in full and remarkably poised bloom at a very early juncture.\n\n“It’s, um ... unreal,” Swift, who’s now 20, says with a laugh. “I don’t think I expected to be played on pop radio. I don’t think I ever expected to go to the (MTV) Video Music Awards. I never expected to get played in genres that aren’t country and ... I never expected the kind of success I’m having at country, either.\n\n“My parents raised me to believe that the most annoying thing in the world is people who feel they’re entitled to success or fame or whatever, so I’ve just never been that way. I think it’s just better to do the work and go out there on stage and show people you love doing this and it’s your favorite thing in the world.”\n\nMusic became Swift’s thing while she was growing up in the small southeastern Pennsylvania town of Wyomissing. Her grandmother was an opera singer, but Swift herself developed a taste for country and rock. “Def Leppard was played in my house a lot,” she recalls.\n\nHer own interest in music surfaced early, via Disney movies. She locked into country after hearing LeAnn Rimes when she was 6 years old, and by age 10 Swift was performing at fairs, festivals, karaoke contests and talent shows around her hometown. She made some initially unsuccessful trips to Nashville, Tenn., channeling the rejection — from the music business and from other children — into an early song called “The Outside.” She won praise for her performance at a U.S. Open tennis tournament and ultimately landed a recording contract after Scott Borchetta of Big Machine Records saw her perform at the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville.\n\nDuring the past year, meanwhile — and certainly since the release of her second album, “Fearless,” in November 2008 — Swift has raised the stakes of her stardom. The six-times platinum “Fearless,” in fact, was recently proclaimed the most awarded album in country music history, the only release ever to win Album of the Year at the Grammys — where she was the youngest artist ever to take home that prize — and also country album honors from the Grammys, the CMA, the ACM and the AMAs.\n\n“It’s the same kind of album I made (in 2006) — just two years older,” says Swift, whose acceptance speech at last fall’s Video Music Awards was famously interrupted by Kanye West, who felt the trophy should have gone to Beyoncé. “Sound-wise, it’s the kind of songs I like to write, which are country songs, but I guess because of the subject matter and because of some of the melodies I love to use, I guess they have crossover appeal.\n\n“I like to think of it more as spillover, because I’m a country artist and I write country songs, and I’m lucky enough to have them played on pop radio.”\n\nThere’s no question that the songs on “Fearless” — all written or co-written by Swift, who was also an executive producer — cut into some personal territory. “Forever & Always,” for instance, is about her breakup with pop star Joe Jonas of the Jonas Brothers, while “Hey Stephen” is about Love & Theft’s Stephen Barker Liles, who toured with Swift, and “Fifteen” — “My favorite song I’ve ever written,” she says — chronicles freshman year exploits with her best friend, Abigail.\n\n“I really tried to not write songs about being on the road and sleeping in hotel rooms and the tour bus,” explains Swift, who lives in a 4,000-plus-square-foot condo in Nashville and has been romantically linked to actor and “Valentine’s Day” co-star Taylor Lautner, among others. “I got albums when I was younger and there would be songs about that sort of thing, and I couldn’t really relate to it.\n\n“So I really try to write more about what I feel and guys and love because that’s what fascinates me more than anything else — love and what it does to us and how we treat people and how they treat us. So pretty much every song on the album has a face that I associate with it.”\n\nThat’s brave terrain for an artist of any age, much less one as young as Swift. But Swift, who’s already working on material for her third album and who also wrote a song, “Best Days of Your Life,” for former “American Idol” contestant and opening act Kellie Pickler’s latest album, says that’s all part of being, well, “Fearless.”\n\n“What the word ‘fearless’ means to me is not that you don’t have fears,” she explains. “It’s not that you’re not afraid of anything. Being fearless to me means you’re afraid of a lot of things, but you jump anyway.\n\n“I think that’s what we’re doing on this album, and it’s what I want to do for as long as I make music — which I want to be forever, so there you go. I want to be fearless forever.”\n\nIf you go\n\nTaylor Swift, Kellie Pickler and Gloriana perform at 7 p.m. today and Saturday, March 26 and 27, at the Palace, Lapeer Road at I-75, Auburn Hills. Tickets are sold out. Call 248-377-0100 or visit",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript, complete version] Taylor Made\nSHE BEGAN SINGING TO STRANGERS ON THE BEACH AT AGE 3: BY 11, SHE WAS HANDING OUT DEMO CDS. TAYLOR SWIFT, AMERICA'S NEWEST SWEETHEART. ON THE DRIVE AND DISCIPLINE THAT GOT HER TO THE TOP By Kimberly Cutter Photographed by Mark Abrahams; Fashion editor: Elizabeth Stewart\n\nTaylor Swift loves a lot of things, but maybe nothing quite so much at this moment as her new Prevost tour bus. \"It's amazing!\" she says, bounding through the backstage labyrinth of the Save Mart Center in Fresno, California, where she'll be performing tonight — long Goldilocks curls bouncing behind her as she goes. \"My mom and I just redid the whole thing. Come see!\"\nInside, the bus is a lush girly fantasy in chocolate brown and peacock blue, complete with a tufted brown velvet couch and pearly blonde laminated wood paneling, an electric fireplace (\"Because I'm always freezing!\"), a big champagne marble bathroom, and a Star Trac treadmill that folds up like a Murphy bed. \"We bought the old bus from Cher,\" explains Swift's mom, Andrea, who goes on every tour, watching from the sidelines, keen-eyed and silent as an eagle. \"So it was all black and gothic.\" For the new bus, she says, \"We wanted to brighten things up.\"\nIn Swift's bedroom, a big turquoise satin jewelry box has the word Barbie written across it in rhinestones, and Swift's first two multiplatinum albums shine above her silky, pillow-piled turquoise-and-brown bed like twin full moons. A sign over the door reads Never, Never, Never Give Up in curling bronze script.\n\"Did you have that made?\" I ask her.\n\"No. I got it from T.J. Maxx,\" chirps Swift, who may be the world's least snobbish pop princess. In Taylor Swift's world (or \"Taylor Nation,\" as fans call it), Urban Outfitters T-shirts and $900 Christian Louboutin stilettos are embraced with equal fervor. All the crew members are presented with cakes on their birthdays and serenaded by Swift herself. And everyone — literally everyone — is greeted with a hug and an enormous smile. It's kind of like meeting Mickey at Disney World. The weeping 8-year-old fan in a pink cowboy hat gets a hug. The mayor of Fresno gets a hug. Even the sweaty, walrus-shaped teenage boy with the slightly crazed glint in his eye gets a hug — though when he starts pawing Swift and kissing her all over her face, two beefy security guys step in and carry him off. \"It scares the daylights out of me when she goes around hugging everybody,\" says Scott Borchetta, who signed Swift to his then-newborn record label, Big Machine, in 2005. \"I have to turn my head when she does it during the concerts. But you couldn't stop her if you tried; she's just a born hugger.\"\nSwift's gasping love for most things she sets eyes on (Starbucks coffee, low-fat strawberry Pop-Tarts, and members of the band Def Leppard included) might get old quickly if it weren't accompanied by a big winking dose of sass that gives her a Tinker Bell-ish quality. At 20, she is tall and skinny as a string bean, with long, gangly white arms and a plump, angelic face. Her eyes are blue as forget-me-nots, with a slightly Asian tilt and thick curling lashes that she flirts with expertly and shamelessly, like Scarlett O'Hara.\nThough Swift was born in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, and lived there until she was 14, there is a specifically Southern flavor to much of her appeal. She loves flouncy miniskirts and candy-colored strapless dresses and halo-style headbands with silk flowers sewn on. She says \"Y'all\" and \"Thay-nk ewe!\" She prays. She bakes. (When she's home in Nashville, she regularly delivers homemade pumpkin-spice cookies with cream cheese frosting to the construction guys working on her new condo.) But there's a clear-eyed, laser-focus quality to Swift's attention, too — you sense there's a mighty brain ticking beneath all those blonde curls. \"I love having a goal, feeling like I'm on a mission,\" says Swift. \"I love trying to beat what I've done so far.\"\nAt the moment, that's a tall order. Swift's second album, Fearless, was the best-selling album of any genre in 2009. An addictive confection of country/pop love songs, Fearless stole the hearts of little girls and not-so-little girls all over America, sitting at number one on the Billboard Top 200 for 11 weeks, which is longer than any other album in the last decade. Come awards time, Swift took home four Grammys (including Best Album of the Year) and the MTV Moonman for Best Female Video (aka The Kanye Incident) — along with a truckload of other trophies, including the CMA award for Entertainer of the Year in 2009. Tickets for Swift's recent concert at L.A.'s Staples Center sold out in two minutes. Last year, she earned $18 million from albums and touring alone.\nSuddenly, Taylor Swift is an enormous star. Like, the kind of star people have started comparing to Michael Jackson and Madonna. The kind of star who tours with nine buses and several purple trucks that have her face plastered on the side. The kind of star about whom Borchetta says, \"Look, if she can produce a superior third album, one that's as big as the last two ... well, when's the last time somebody did that?\"\nFresno is an interesting place to see Swift perform. Basically, the whole town has gone bananas over her — including the mayor, who has officially proclaimed today \"Taylor Swift Day.\" (In part, this may be an attempt to distract residents from the fact that Fresno was recently rated the number one Drunkest City in America by Men's Health magazine, but still ...) A dusty farm town in the middle of California, Fresno is the land of monster trucks and short-haired, churchgoing ladies in ruffled homemade aprons and Easy Spirit shoes who sell their crafts at the Big Hat Days festival in neighboring Clovis. Swift, who does not drink or swear or flash cleavage, is huge here.\nOutside the Save Mart Center, near the herd of Taylor Swift tour buses, a local radio station has set up its own bus and is broadcasting live all afternoon from a big loudspeaker. What seems like thousands of little girls and teenage girls and middle-aged girls are milling about in the parking lot — some dressed in homemade versions of the oversize \"Junior Jewels\" T-shirt and black nerd glasses that Swift wears in her \"You Belong With Me\" video — carrying huge \"Taylor\" signs and screaming \"Taylor!\" from time to time.\n\"I like her because she's young and pretty and she writes stuff we can relate to,\" says pretty, freckle-faced Caroline Meyers, whose mother has driven her and her best friend, Lexi Kraft, here 240 miles from Colusa, California. Both girls are 17. Both are wearing T-shirts that say \"I drive by my ex-boyfriend's house too!\" — something Swift admitted to doing in a CMT interview. \"She's a good role model,\" adds Kraft. \"Also, she's really pretty.\"\nSwift has performed in Fresno before — but never like this. The first time she played here, in 2006, it was at Cali's Frozen Custard Creamery out on Blackstone Avenue. Swift, then 16, was in town for a promotional radio tour. She and her band stopped off for frozen yogurt and ended up playing an impromptu concert. The second time was two years ago, when she opened for Rascal Flatts. So when Swift appears later in the afternoon for a meet-and-greet backstage with the various radio people of Fresno and says, \"I can't tell y'all how long I have been waiting for this night!\", you actually believe her.\nFor Swift, performing seems not so much a profession as a calling. Like being a nun or a Jedi Knight. It's the only thing she's ever wanted to do, at all. Ever. \"I have been singing randomly, obsessively, obnoxiously for as long as I can remember,\" says Swift, who grew up on an idyllic Christmas-tree farm in rural Pennsylvania with her own pony. The oldest child of well-to-do parents (her father, Scott, is a stockbroker; her mother, Andrea, quit her job as a mutual fund marketing executive to raise Swift and Swift's little brother, Austin), Swift insists that although her parents believed in her completely, the burning need to sing in public was entirely her own. \"My parents have videos of me on the beach at, like, 3,\" she continues, \"going up to people and singing Lion King songs for them. I was literally going from towel to towel, saying, 'Hi, I'm Taylor. I'm going to sing I Just Can't Wait to Be King for you now.'\"\nWe're sitting on the couch in her backstage dressing room, which she shares with her brunette backup singer, Liz Huett, and her redheaded fiddle player, Caitlin Evanson, who are also two of her best friends. They both feature prominently in the homemade videos that Swift posts regularly for fans on taylorswift.com and Facebook, and they flank Swift like handmaidens. A big rack of bright, silky dresses stands against one wall; a forest of Louboutins is spread out over the floor. A giant soda from In-n-Out Burger sits melting on the coffee table.\n\"It's very Taylor to want to share her dressing room,\" Swift's publicist, Paula Erickson, said earlier. \"She just likes having her friends around.\" And while that's true, it's worth noting that toward the end of every concert, Evanson and Swift have a spectacular, hair-thrashing drumming battle on two big steel garbage cans during the song \"Should've Said No.\" (Swift always wins.)\nIt's about 5:30 in the afternoon, and Swift has just finished her preconcert rehearsal. She does not seem nervous at all. In fact, she seems downright relaxed. Dressed in a loose gray miniskirt and black Rag & Bone dance shoes with patent leather tips, she has been trying to explain to me what it's like to be born with such an intense sense of destiny, and how completely it has defined and driven her life so far. \"It's literally all I've ever dreamed of,\" she says.\nBy the time she was 10, the details of Swift's future had begun to fall into place. She knew she wanted to be a country singer. She knew she needed to go to Nashville to make it happen. She'd discovered karaoke and was teaching herself to sing like Faith Hill and the Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain. She had taken to performing at any event she could find, including garden clubs and Boy Scout meetings, which made her seriously unpopular at school. Swift didn't care. She was on a mission. \"I knew that everything I wanted to happen could happen in Nashville,\" she says. \"So it became my number one goal to get there somehow.\"\nWhen Swift was 11, her parents caved and took her to visit during spring break. Swift spent the whole time on Music Row, going from record company to record company (while her mom waited outside in the rental car), handing out her demo CD and saying, basically, \"Hi, I'm Taylor, and I want a record deal. Call me!\" At 14, she became the youngest staff songwriter Sony/ATV had ever signed. \"I couldn't believe it,\" says Swift. \"I was like, 'I'm getting to write with someone who's written for Keith Urban!'\"\nAt this point, the entire Swift family packed up and moved to Hendersonville (a suburb of Nashville) to let Swift pursue her dream, which may help explain why she took the whole thing so seriously. Andrea Swift, a stout, gracious, middle-aged blonde in black trainer pants and sneakers, declined to be interviewed for this story, but over the course of the day, I got the sense that she both adores her daughter and is continually stunned by her — as if she'd given birth to a unicorn. \"I was very disciplined,\" continues Swift, who was also very happy to exorcise the ongoing frustrations and crushes and heartbreaks she was experiencing at Hendersonville High School in her almost completely autobiographical songs. \"I'd come in with 10 or 15 new songs each week just to prove I was serious about it.\" A year later, Borchetta saw Swift perform at the Bluebird Café and signed her to his just-hatched record company, Big Machine — and the Taylor Swift train was on its way. \"I knew the first time I saw her play,\" says Borchetta. \"I thought, Oh, my God. I just love this girl.\"\nThis is a common reaction to Swift, who seems to exude sunlight. There's this grand, lovely \"Come on in!\" air about her that extends to strangers and family members equally and is clearly a large part of what has attracted her enormous fan base. But what stayed with me the most after spending time with her is the unbelievable focus and intelligence with which Swift has planned and strategized every aspect of her career. From the heart sign she makes with her fingers when she performs (11,000 Fresno-ites will sign it back to her later tonight) to the ivy-covered fairy-tale towers in her concerts to her now-famous sparkling Swarovski-crystal-encrusted guitar, Swift understands iconography and branding on a flat-out genius level. Obviously, she has a creative team working with her, but it's clear that the vision, the driving force, is all Swift's.\n\"I think about my next move 10 steps ahead,\" she says. \"I'm always planning three awards shows ahead. For me, planning is a productive way of stressing out about your life.\" She's not necessarily calculating; it's more that Swift wants so badly to make the fairy-tale world of Taylor Nation come alive that she will happily devote every ounce of her attention to making that happen.\nThis is doubly true of her presence on the Internet. Swift is part of a generation of pop stars who were basically born on the Internet, and who use their MySpace and Twitter and Facebook accounts to communicate directly (and constantly) with their fans. At last count, Swift had 4,147,075 fans on Facebook. She seems to spend much of her waking life updating this page, along with her website and her Twitter and MySpace pages — not just with tour dates and information about, say, her new line of cards for American Greetings, but with all kinds of personal stuff about her life. Here's a typical Swift tweet: \"At the nail salon. Toes under the nail-dryer thing. They put me in front of the bowl of Tootsie Rolls. Now they're having to refill it.\"\nIt's as though Swift is her own paparazzi. Go to her website, and you can watch Taylor Swift get fitted for a new retainer (viewed by more than 1 million people); snuggle with her mom in Pennsylvania as a baby in footsie pajamas; ham around at the beach in Sydney, Australia, with Huett and Evanson; bake a birthday cake for her little brother, Austin; primp for Homecoming in Nashville. Her whole life is there. It's not so much that Swift is revealing her private life as that Swift's public and private lives are one and the same. The fans give her love and adoration, and for that she is more than happy to give them an all-access pass to her lovely, sunny, ass-kicking life. Unlike so many celebrities who hide behind their sunglasses and tinted windows, Swift is standing in the open doorway of her house, smiling and saying, \"Come on in, y'all!\"\nSongwriting is like breathing for Swift. It's the first thing she thinks about when she gets up in the morning and the last thing she thinks about before she goes to bed at night. \"Right now, the number one priority in my life is figuring out how to process what I'm feeling and translate it into musical form,\" she says, admitting that she is \"completely obsessed\" with finishing the new album, which is due out in the fall. \"It's like, 'Oh, my God, I'm confused right now. What's the rhyme I could use here?'\" The boys in her life know they're going to get written about, and they know, too, that if they misbehave, they're going to hear Swift singing about it in public. In her hilarious Saturday Night Live monologue last fall, Swift cheekily copped to \"writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me\" (referencing her ex-boyfriend Joe Jonas of the Jonas Brothers, who famously dumped her on the phone), and gave a shout-out to Twilight's werewolf heartthrob Taylor Lautner (the other half of \"T Squared,\" whom she met on the set of Valentine's Day and was reportedly dating at the time). \"Everyone in my life knows,\" she says, \"whenever something happens, the only way it's going to be over and finished and put to bed is if it's written about.\"\nNowhere is this more clear than at Swift's concert, where she is, quite frankly, spectacular. Here, in the dark, with her fans screaming and holding up their glowing cell phones the way people used to hold up lighters, Swift bounds and skips across the stage in her various sparkly dresses, twirling in circles and shaking her hair, simply glowing with pleasure. \"I can't tell you how happy I am to be here, singing for a couple thousand of my closest friends,\" she shouts, and even though you know this cannot possibly be true, when Taylor Swift shouts it, you believe it.\n\"Taylor loves telling stories,\" her mom said proudly on a backstage VIP tour before the show began, pointing out the big red-painted curtain in front of the stage with the gold TS in a cameo on top. \"She wants you to feel like you're living her stories with her when you're here.\" And it's true: When that red curtain rises, we are in Taylor Swift's world. It's a world in which band geeks transform into prom queens in long white gowns, and philandering ex-boyfriends are dealt swift and gleeful justice. A world in which Swift throws chairs and gets swept off her feet by a prince in a 16th-century costume, and gets thoroughly soaked in a rainstorm, but always, always, comes out on top.\n",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: The Dazzler\nWith a new album, a home of her own, and a big birthday on the horizon, Taylor Swift comes of age.\nBy Jonathan Van Meter\nApril 15, 2010\n\nPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz\n\nHas anyone ever made more of the sparkly little dress? “I just love them,” says Taylor Swift from her parents' kitchen in Nashville. “Especially onstage, because I think it's kind of fun when the spotlight hits you and your dress, for a millisecond, blinds people.”\n\nFor two years Swift has been dazzling, if not blinding, people with her astonishingly grown-up knack for crafting sublime pop songs about high school subject matter—boys, being sixteen—that somehow everyone can relate to. It doesn't hurt that those gems come from such a dreamy package: She is tall, beautiful, and poised, with that fairy-tale cascade of curls. In a pop-cultural landscape where vulgarity and controversy are the coin of the realm, she dares to be a young lady.\n\nSwift calls herself a “spillover artist”—her music fills up country radio until it spills over into pop, and then up and over again into adult contemporary. Because of this, she's had the best run at the top of the charts of any artist in a decade. At 20, she is the youngest person ever to win the Grammy for Album of the Year. But 2010 is going to mark something of a turning point for the singing phenom, whose success has launched a million wannabes (“They seem to be a lot like me,” she says with characteristic modesty). A new album will arrive this fall, she is finally moving out of her parents' house, and in December she'll turn 21. She is in the midst of renovating her own place in Nashville. Big? “It's not giant. I didn't want to have to MapQuest to get to the kitchen.”\n\nLike her last album, the new one will be very personal, but it will be about being 20, not sixteen. “I don't think I could put on a new character for two years of my life if it wasn't really what I was going through. I have these formulas for making music; they're almost mathematical: Who are you today? What did you write about in your diary? What idea hit you at 4:00 A.M.?”\n\nShe is working very hard to not let success change her essential Taylor Swift-ness, a girl who, at the end of the day, still eats at Cracker Barrel and shops at Urban Outfitters. “Looking back on what these past two years have been for me, it feels like this magical dream of, Really? We toured all over the world? We played an arena in London? This is happening? Readjusting my goals and dreams has been something I've had to do a lot lately.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Taylor seems to have it all. But her biggest enemy? Her own thoughts!\nTaylor steps off the stage after her show, and she's so excited -she finished an amazing set, family and bandmates are congratulating her, and fans are tweeting her like crazy. But then Taylor gets five minutes alone in her dressing room, and the worries start to creep in -did she sound good during \"Love Story?\" Why hasn't the boy she liked called? And what's her BFF Abigail doing back home without her? It's one thought after the next. Taylor's mind is on over- drive-and she just can't stop!\n\n\"I feel like I'm the only one going through it\"\nDespite having an album, hit song. and tour all called Fearless, Taylor doesn't always live up to the word. On the outside, she seems happy and carefree, but secretly on the inside, Taylor is always scribbling her constantly flowing thoughts in notebooks. \"I overthink everything. I overanalyze everything,\" she says. When Taylor's brain goes into overdrive, it's tough to pause and breathe. She re-thinks everything from what she tweeted to what she said to her crush, and she wonders what everyone will think about any move she makes especially her family. \"My parents have always been really respectful of me, so I've always been really respectful of them,\" Taylor tells J-14. \"My worst fear is to let them down, so that's why I don't misbehave.\" Then all of those concerns begin to feel overwhelming. \"Usually when life is happening to you, you feel like you're the only one going through it,\" she admits. \"When I finish a song, sometimes I think, 'I must be the only person who has ever felt this way, right?\" But once she puts a song out there, Taylor finally realizes that she's not the only one struggling- and knowing that she's not alone makes her feel better. \n\n\"I need what I'm feeling to make sense\"\nThat's why Taylor puts pen to paper - to figure out all those confusing Issues. She sits down, collects her thoughts, and writes everything out. \"I need for what I'm feeling to make more sense to me, so I make it into a song,\" she explains. By working out her big and small problems step-by-step, Taylor finally finds a way to breathe. After all, Taylor knows that being fearless has nothing to do with actual fear. \"You can be afraid of a lot of things, but you jump anyway,\" she tells J-14. And that's exactly what Taylor reminds herself to do-stop overanalyzing and just jump!\n\nHer nostalgic moments: Taylor's firsts!\nIt's not just new experiences that send Taylor's thoughts into a tailspin- she also thinks about all of the fave firsts in her life!\nHer first job... At just 14, Taylor became a staff writer with Sony Publishing-she got paid to pen songs! \"That was my first job, and I took it very seri- ously,\" Taylor reveals. \"That was my first intro into Nashville.\nHer first CD bought... Taylor loves LeAnn Rimes song \"Blue,\" off Rimes the 1996 album of the same name-LeAnn was just 13 then! \"All the things that I would day- dream about in my bed- room, she was up there doing.\" Taylor says.\nHer first date... \"We went out to dinner in down- town Nashville, and then I think we went to Starbucks after- ward,\" she tells J-14. \"It was very exciting.\nHer first hit single... Taylor wrote \"Tim McGraw\" during her freshman year of high school about her BF who was going off to college.\nHer first movie... Taylor saw The Little Mermaid when she was about three, and she says she sang the film's songs the whole way home -after seeing it just once!",

I was lucky enough to hear it pretty early on, so it's so exciting for it to be out and own the songs instead of just be singing them [in my head],\" she dished, sharing that just because Swift is one of the biggest pop stars in the world doesn't mean she's at all critical of her friends who can't sing as well as her.\n\n\"Taylor's a pretty normal girl,\" Stone said. \" ... She's not [like], 'I am one of the world's most popular singers.' \"\n\nStone's kind words came shortly after an email was read to her from her superstar pal who wanted to know more about her love of baking. \"I've been baking at least once a day,\" she shared, revealing some of the sweet treats she's been making the past few months.\n\nWhile she's got some sweet skills when it comes to confections, when she attempts to bake for a large group, the results aren't as delicious. \"I made 60 biscuits once for a party,\" she said. \"They didn't turn out so great, though.

      "Transcript/Content": "CMT Insider Interview: Taylor Swift on Conclusion of Tour, Summer Plans\nSuperstar Talks About Working on New Album and Moving Into Her Condo\nJune 16, 2010\n\nWhen Taylor Swift ended her Fearless tour earlier this month at Gillette Stadium near Boston, she talked to CMT Insider's Katie Cook about her life on the road and plans for the summer. Here's a portion of the interview:\n\nWe were with you when you kicked off your Fearless tour in Evansville, Ind., in 2009. Does that seem like a lifetime ago now?\n\nSwift: It does. It was 15 months ago that we started this tour ... and it's slowly morphed into a more advanced version of what we started 15 months ago. I'm so excited that we're ending it in a stadium.\n\nAnd it's a huge amount of people here. The Evansville show was almost 13,000 people, but this is almost 60,000.\n\nI know. I keep having these moments where throughout the course of the day I'm like, \"We're gonna play in a stadium tonight. We're gonna end the tour in a stadium -- 60,000 people.\" That's just so beautiful to try and wrap your mind around. And it's our second stadium that we've played on this tour, and I don't think that the newness is ever going to wear off playing stadiums for me.\n\nWith the tour over, do you think might actually get to do normal things -- like go to the movies?\n\nWell, I'm actually going to be working on my record nonstop.\n\nBut you're supposed to have some time off this summer, aren't you?\n\nFor me, time off is working on a project and writing nonstop and spending all day and all night trying to get the exact perfect word for the third word in the second line of the bridge. For me, my life is a crossword puzzle at times. Like when I'm making an album, it's all about filling in the blanks and making it click. And when it finally does, it's so worth it.\n\nThe last time we talked to you was in New York in December, and you were in the midst of this tornado of activity. Do you feel like it's calmed down a bit?\n\nIn some ways. I've just been kind of making an album and playing shows every week. It's weird to say that it feels like I've settled into sort of a normal routine where I'll play three or four shows a week, and the days that I'm not playing shows, I'm recording or sitting in my producer's basement, and we're like tweaking little things about mixes and adding little instrument parts. It's really a fun way to live, and it's a fun way to spend the summer. I'm so excited about just throwing myself into making the album completely, but it does feel like I get some time to go over and check on my condo and the construction.\n\nHow's that going, by the way?\n\nOh, it's going awesome. I'm so excited. I keep saying that it's going to be a month before I can move in ... As time goes by, everybody around me is saying, \"OK, six months ago, it was going to be a month before you can move in.\" But I have also kept adding things, so it's kind of my fault.\n\nI heard you have a birdcage?\n\nYeah, but it's giant. It's like people-sized. You can put a table in there, and I'm going to. I'm so excited.\n\nJust eat dinner in a birdcage in your condo?\n\nYou know, why wouldn't you?\n\nIn a recent interview, Lady Gaga admitted she loves to sing \"You Belong With Me\" at the top of her lungs. She said, \"I think it's because it's very whimsical in a way that I'm not necessarily whimsical. When it comes on, I want to sing it. Every woman feels that way.\" What do you think about that?\n\nI loved that. That absolutely made my day when I read that because I'm a huge fan of hers. I remember the first time I ever saw her on TRL. I was at MTV and was watching the monitor, and she was doing, I think, her first interview on TRL. She had a leotard on, and I just thought to myself, \"That's so daring. Her music must be daring like that.\" I went home and downloaded \"Just Dance,\" and it turns out that it was. And every move she's made in her career is just as daring as wearing a leotard on TRL, so I'm a huge fan of hers. That really, really made me smile, so I appreciated that.\n\nHow does it feel to be chosen for the CoverGirl ad campaign?\n\nReally cool. I remember when I was a little kid, I used to always think about what that must be like. And I never thought that it was ever possible for me to be in a CoverGirl ad. So it was really, really cool, and everybody that I've worked with at CoverGirl has been really nice to me. They're all about just kind of being yourself and how makeup fits into your life. And I really like that. I have fun putting on makeup before I go onstage every night because I always do my hair and makeup myself on tour. So it's really cool because I've really loved makeup for a long time.\n\nAny more movie roles coming up?\n\nI'm not making any movies right now. I'm making music, and that's always been my No. 1 love. It's been so cool to be able to be a part of things that have been really fun, like being in Valentine's Day and getting to guest star in CSI. ... I feel like I get to do tiny little mini-movies when I make music videos, so that kind of fulfills that little need and desire for me. But if I ever get time, I'd really like to do that.\n\nThere's a moment in your concerts where you actually walk through the crowd. What does that feel like? The energy must be incredible.\n\nThere is a moment during the show where I pop up in a different place in the arena, all the way at the end of the arena up in the back rows. It's really a fun moment for me because it's an element of surprise, and I love creating those in the show. Also, I walk down through all the fans and get to give them hugs and say hi to them, and it's really cool to get to do that. It's also really fun to get to do that at stadiums because there's just a certain energy. There are 60,000 people instead of 15,000, and that just adds something.\n\nI'm just impressed that you can get back there.\n\nThank you. We map it out. We're pretty calculated about it, and it's sort of like my secret agent moment of the night.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift on getting ‘Speak Now’ right where she wanted it\nOct. 21, 2010 3:53 PM PT\n\nShare\nThis article was originally on a blog post platform and may be missing photos, graphics or links. See About archive blog posts.\n\nOne of the topics I discussed with Taylor Swift during an afternoon spent with her last summer at Capitol Records in Hollywood while she was finishing work on her new album, “Speak Now,” was how it came about that, unlike her first two CDs, she didn’t collaborate with other songwriters on any of the album’s 14 songs.\n\nHer response opened a window into her creative process, both as a songwriter and as the album’s co-producer, with Nathan Chapman.\n\n“I didn’t consciously go into this record and go, ‘I’m going to do this all by myself; I’m going to write this one without any co-writers!’ It just happened that way,” said Swift, who is profiled in Sunday’s Arts & Books section. “When we were picking songs, it just ended up the ones that made the record were all ones I’d written by myself.”\n\nIndeed, she told me she had written some songs for the new album with other writers early on, with the expectation they’d be on her third album, which arrives Monday. But then the honing process kicked in.\n\n“I make lists,” she said. “I’ll make song lists of what I think the album could be, with the track order and everything. As time would go by, I’d write a new song that was better than all the [other] songs on the record, so I’d bump one off.\n\n“Then I’d write a new one that was better, and I’d bump another one off that wasn’t as strong,” she said. “I remember I’ve revised that list probably 30 times. I have thought about it, and obsessed over it and finally gotten it to a place where I’m so proud of it. I’ve said everything I’ve wanted to say that’s happened in the last two years. I can’t wait for people to hear it.”\n\nShe also displayed a fighter’s spirit when I asked how she felt moving into the crowded field of adult singer-songwriters after creating a broad-based market that she quickly came to own by creating honest music about life as a teenager, written and sung by one.\n\n“I love those questions,” she said, her pale blue eyes flashing. “I love writing music about what happened to me today. That keeps it really like a journal. This is just the next phase of it.”\n\nBecause also she co-produced her 2008 album “Fearless,” we spoke about the extent to which she’s gotten more involved with the technical aspects of recording and production: Is she fluent in ProTools and such? As usual, her thoughts ultimately came back to the big picture view of what she wants to do with her music.\n\n“I felt like taking on this record -- having written it all -- it was a bigger undertaking,” she said. “I co-produced ‘Fearless’ too, but there’s something different about this album,” she said. “It’s hard to describe, but being in there every single day just picking apart every little thing about every little song and making sure that it was right….\n\n“Nathan is incredible at going through the computer and we find these different sounds to create and to get us where we want it to go,” she said. “But I’ve always just been about figuring out what it is I hear in my head, and making it sound like that.\n\n“I can learn all the technological things that are involved and all the tricks and all the keyboard shortcuts. But for me,” Swift said, “it’s always going to be this larger goal of making the song sound through the speakers the way it sounds in my head.”\n\n-- Randy Lewis",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: the next chapter\n\n(Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)\nBy Randy Lewis, Los Angeles Times\nOct. 24, 2010 12 AM PT\n\nShare\nStudio A at Capitol Records in Hollywood is the fabled place where Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, the Beach Boys and other stellar names in popular music made some of their most beloved recordings over the last half century.\n\nOn an unseasonably pleasant day last summer, however, the artist sitting dead center in front of the imposing 60-channel mixing board was Taylor Swift, the erstwhile teen queen of country-pop music who has dominated sales charts and captured the ears of her generation as firmly as any of her celebrated predecessors.\n\nTo Swift’s right is Nathan Chapman, the producer she worked with on her multiplatinum 2006 debut album, “Taylor Swift,” and its even bigger-selling 2008 follow-up, “Fearless,” albums that have sold nearly 11 million copies combined.\n\nOn the other side of the glass partition separating the control booth from the studio, leading an orchestra of 28 string players, is Paul Buckmaster, the veteran British conductor-arranger whose string arrangements contributed substantially to the sound and success of Elton John’s earliest records as well as more recent recordings by country star Tim McGraw and rock group Train.\n\nIt’s the first time Swift has used an orchestra on record, and she sounds thrilled with what she’s hearing as the violinists, violists and cellists bow edgy accents and dramatic countermelodies on two tracks — “Haunted” and “Back to December” — from her highly anticipated third album, “Speak Now,” which will be released Monday worldwide.\n\n“I couldn’t sleep last night I was so freaked about this,” Swift, 20, whispers nervously to a visitor seated next to her. “You should have seen me all geeky when I saw the names of the new songs on the sheet music out on their music stands. I was like, ‘Oh my God, it’s happening.’”\n\nRaising expectations\n\n“Speak Now” represents a big musical step for Swift. It’s one she’s taking with a confidence that’s made her a favorite of millions of teen girls as well as many of their parents, just as it’s bred a legion of skeptics who argue that no one could remain so genuinely thrilled every time she or he steps in front of a TV camera.\n\nScott Borchetta, the veteran Nashville music executive who signed her at age 16 to his nascent Big Machine Records label, is impressed at how she’s handled the success she’s achieved in the last four years, becoming the biggest selling act in all of pop music.\n\nHer debut album was a left-field hit many saw as a fluke. Then “Fearless” came out and proved Swift’s appeal was anything but happenstance. Now, Borchetta recognizes the high expectations.\n\n“We’re not sneaking up on anyone with this one,” he said. “For the first time in her career, we’re not the underdog. All eyes are on her.”\n\nCase in point: the new album’s first single, “Mine,” leaked on the Internet ahead of its scheduled release date, kicking the campaign leading up to the album release into high gear early. It quickly rose to No. 3 on Billboard’s Hot 100 singles chart and has sold more than 1.1 million digital tracks, pushing her total digital track sales above 30 million.\n\n“In one breath, you could say everything is on the line,” Borchetta said. “But when you really step back, it’s just record No. 3, and this is not going to be her last record, whether it sells 5 million copies or a million and a half. That’s for her fan base to decide.”\n\nHer own material\n\nBack in the studio, Swift is wearing a light blue flower print miniskirt and a white top under a long, lightweight white sweater that dangles below the hem of the skirt. Her waist length brown hair is woven into a single braid that falls over her left shoulder, far enough into her lap that she often fiddles with it during the session with the orchestra.\n\nThe strings, however, aren’t there simply to add musical sweetness; Swift and Chapman, who share production duties as they did on “Fearless,” want them to add sonic bite and palpable emotion. The use of the orchestra is one indication of how Swift, pegged as the young singer and songwriter who created a niche for age-specific pop- country music and quickly came to own it, is growing up.\n\nAnother was her recent arena concert tour, a conceptually ambitious production that presented not just a cavalcade of her hits and album tracks to tens of thousands of fans each night, but a show that took them inside the head, heart and imagination of a typical teenage girl, warts and all. (She’ll headline a world tour next year that’s scheduled to include 85 shows in 18 countries.)\n\nWhere she’d worked on her first two albums with various writing partners, this time the songs are hers and hers alone — a source of pride for Swift, who views herself first and foremost as a songwriter.\n\n“It was a great move for her,” said John Ivey, program director for KIIS-FM (102.7), L.A.’s leading Top 40 station. “I can’t tell you how many times on the last two records I heard people say ‘She couldn’t have possibly written this; it had to be the other writer.’”\n\nShe’s won other fans in high places with her ability to tell stories that ring true.\n\n“She blows me away,” 74-year-old country music veteran Kris Kristofferson said backstage recently at Club Nokia, where Swift shared the stage with him and two other country standard bearers, Emmylou Harris and Vince Gill. “It’s amazing to me that someone so young is writing such great songs,” Kristofferson said. “She’s got a great career ahead of her.” Performing alongside Kristofferson put her on a plane with another songwriter who etched out a career more in spite of, than as a result of, his technical skills as a singer.\n\nIn December, Swift turns 21. The Wyomissing, Pa., native recently moved out of her parents’ home in Hendersonville, Tenn., into a condo of her own near downtown Nashville that she’s decorating herself, a step toward independence that her success is allowing her to take on a scale few of her fans can possibly relate to. She focuses instead on the emotional complexities of her transition on the new album in “Never Grow Up.”\n\nSwift quickly established a strong public persona as a typical teen wrestling with many of the issues her fans face. She’s let them watch and listen in as she has navigated her way through life, first through the hyperdramatic waters of teenhood, and now into the onset of adulthood. She’s tackling more sophisticated themes now than the ones that occupied her attention while she was just another high school student whose biggest worry was whether she’d have a date for the prom.\n\nKIIS-FM’s Ivey suggests Swift’s transition from teen idol to adult pop star is developing far more organically than those of many other female singers who found fame early. He credits it to the songs she’s written out of her own experience.\n\n“She’s different than poor Hilary, Miley, Christina or Britney,” Ivey said. “Britney and, to some extent, Miley…. I love them both, but they had to go from being kids to humping a pole. It was a jerky A-to-B. This isn’t.”\n\nIn “Mine,” Swift offers her side of dialogue with a boyfriend in which they wrestle with paying bills and their uncertainty over life and love. “Mean” is a biting and witty retort to critics who have skewered her singing ability, most vocally after her rocky duet with Stevie Nicks at the 2010 Grammy Awards. The ballad “Dear John” elucidates the hard choice of cutting ties with a love interest whom she discovers has “a sick need to give love and then take it away.” She lets her inner brat show in the title track, which takes the theme of her hit “You Belong With Me” to the next level as she sings of interrupting the wedding of a beau she thinks is marrying the wrong girl.\n\nAnother example of her expanding choice of subject matter comes in “Innocent,” which she introduced at the recent MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n“This is a song I wrote about somebody who came into my life in the most freakish, unexpected, abrupt way,” she told a visitor while listening to some rough mixes in a black Lincoln Navigator parked in the Capitol lot. In the song, she describes a person as “32 and still growing up/Who you are is not what you did/You’re still an innocent.” Writing the lyrics, says Swift, “taught me a lot about being able to step back from a situation you don’t know what to do with, and put yourself in somebody else’s shoes.”\n\nKanye West, as it happens, was 32 at the time of last year’s infamous VMA incident at in which he grabbed the microphone from Swift’s hand after she’d won the award for best video. Was “Innocent” indeed her reaction to that situation? She answers obliquely.\n\n“These songs are about different people in my life,” she said. “Every song is about someone, and that person is going to know who they are.” (Last week she acknowledged to Billboard that the song is about West.) The question remains whether writing songs about incidents that happen on national television will resonate with her fans like those about first loves and high school disappointments.\n\nMusic is No. 1\n\nShe’s tried her hand at acting, with a guest appearance earlier this year on CBS’ “CSI” series and a featured role in the romantic comedy “Valentine’s Day.” But Swift’s priority remains her music, even as she’s evolved from a kid who started knocking on record company doors in Nashville at age 11 to a certified country-pop star to a merchandising brand that has included a line of inexpensive sundresses she designed for Wal-Mart, a series of American Greetings cards she designed and wrote, and a soon-to-be-introduced line of luxury cosmetics for CoverGirl.\n\n“When we get into a room to make music, it’s pretty much like the first day we worked together,” producer Chapman said in a separate interview. “As far as her writing and her art, she’s just been getting better and better.\n\n“She’s got the [songwriting] craft down,” he said. “She’s constantly editing the lyric as we’re working on the song, trying to make every line feel right. She’ll write herself into a corner, then write herself out pretty quickly. It’s pretty fascinating to be around her when she’s in that mode.”\n\n“She’s still the same Taylor I met when we first started working together,” Chapman added. “If I haven’t seen her change as a person, then she’s handling this massive success pretty well.”\n\nrandy.lewis@latimes.com",

That was the deciding factor. It wasn't really up to me, it was about the number.\"\n\nThe costars seem to have clicked in person, too – they were recently seen hanging out together, when Swift was in L.A. to record with an orchestra for her next album, Speak Now, due Oct. 25.\n\nBut getting married on film \"was a little strange,\" Swift says. \"I get to wear big dresses and wear white all the time on the carpet, but there's nothing quite like actually pretending you're getting married.\"\n\nIf the message in her song \"Mine\" – out Aug. 16 – is any indication, it’ll probably be a long time before she's ready for the real thing. \"It's a song that is about my tendency to run from love – it's been a recent tendency,\" she told viewers during a live Web chat Tuesday.\n\n\"Every really direct example of love that I've had in front of me has ended in goodbye, has ended in breakups,\" she said. \"So I've developed a pattern of sort of running away when it comes time to fall in love. This song is sort of about finding the exception to that.\"\n\nSee what other readers have to say about this story – or leave a comment of your own",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift tells EW about new album 'Speak Now': 'I've covered every emotion that I've felt in the last two years.'\n\nBy Tanner Stransky  Updated on December 20, 2019 08:10AM EST\n\nAs you’re likely very well aware, Grammy-winning star Taylor Swift has recorded another sure-to-be-massive album, Speak Now, which comes out Oct. 25.\nThe star, who has rocketed to fame over the past few years, recently spoke to EW about her new disc, telling us that it’s a “collection of confessions—things I wish I had said when I was in the moment.” The title track, indeed, is about “the moment in a wedding where you speak now or forever hold your peace.” That’s just a tease about the album. More details can be found in the Fall Music Preview in this week’s issue of Entertainment Weekly.\n\nBut until you pick that up, enjoy some outtakes from our chat with Taylor.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Do you remember the moment when you finished the track list and how that felt?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: I finished the track list about two months ago. I don’t stop writing songs when I have enough songs to make an album. For the last two years, I have just been trying to beat what I have on this list of potential songs for the record.\n\nI would think that working on an album is stressful. But when you talk about working on Speak Now, you seem so happy. Was it a joyful process? Or was there a stressful part to making it?\n\nThere is a stressful and joyful element to making an album. For me, I’m either incredibly stressed or overjoyed, and the way that usually goes is that if I’ve just written a song, I’m the happiest you will ever see me. But if I haven’t written a song in a week and a half, I am more stressed than you will ever, ever see me at any other point. If I haven’t written a song in more than about nine days, that’s when I start to zone out in the middle of conversations because I’m thinking about what I could be writing about next. For me, it’s just such a fun challenge to constantly be writing and constantly be trying to top what you just wrote. It’s one of my favorite games to play—trying to beat what I’ve written last. What I wrote last is something I got really excited about when I wrote it, but I know I could write something better. But it’s just a really fun thing to go through.\n\nWould you consider all the songs on this record to be love songs? Or are there some that aren’t?\n\nI would consider the songs on this record as emotions—that’s what they’re about. There are some that are about infatuation and adoration and the positive, magical feelings of love. But then there are the ones that deal with when it goes wrong, which it oftentimes does. And all the different ways that it can go wrong and all the different ways it can make you feel and all the different phases of that you go through. Then there’s just social dynamics, dealing with people and learning about the fact that life is so unpredictable. I think that’s one of the things I’ve learned—life and love are unpredictable.\n\nAnd you love writing about love and breakups. Are you a romantic?\n\nI think that whatever I go through in life will be directly reflected in my music. If I have a bunch of different experiences with a bunch of different people and some of them are good and some of them are bad and some of them are confusing, you have an album like this. You never know what I’m going to write about in the future, but for me, I have a hard time putting together an album that’s just a few emotions. I like to feel like I’ve covered every emotion that I’ve felt in the last two years.\n\nI heard that “Mine” got leaked when you were on a plane, and it was everywhere by the time you landed. How was that for you?\n\nThe release of my first single was nothing like I expected it to be, because I like things to be structured and planned and orderly. And I’ve never known any kind of release other than, you plan the date it’s going to come out and that’s the day that you release it and that’s what happens. When I got on that plane, I just thought I was going to Japan, and I thought it was going to be a regular flight—watch a few movies, take a nap. But an hour into the flight, one of my managers came up to me and said, “Hey, so, try not to panic. But how would you feel about a release of the single on August 5? So that’s 8/5. And eight plus five is 13, which is your lucky number!” I said, “It leaked, didn’t it?” And she said, “Yes.”\n\nSo you had to go with it?\n\nWell, it was two weeks ahead of time, and luckily, we had the single already done and ready to go. Because, we’ve made good time on this album, knock on wood. As far as my next move, I just started asking a bunch of questions: What’s the quality of the recording? Do we know what the source is? Do we know how to prevent this in the future? What’s our next move? OK, we’re releasing it to iTunes right away. What about the radio thing? Oh, we’re just going to let it happen virally. OK. So, at that point, I had to assess whether I should stress out about it. And then I started to think to myself, OK, can I change it? Can I control it? No. But what I can do is make the next move and figure out what that next move is, and I think we made the right choice putting it on iTunes right away and getting it out to the fans. They were nice enough to make it number on iTunes. What the fans did with it was amazing.\n\nWhat is “Mine” about?\n\nMy tendency to run from love. Every really direct example of love that I’ve had in front of me has ended in goodbye and has ended in breakups and things like that. So I think I’ve developed this pattern of sort of running away when it comes time to fall in love. This song is sort of about finding the exception to that.\n\nSome people have been saying that “Mine” sounds like it could have been on Fearless. Has your sound changed for this album?\n\nAs far as my sound changing, I like to address each song as its own thing, and it gets to sort of figure out. In my head, when I write the song, I hear the production. I don’t like to make the album sound all the same, production-wise. We did some things I was really excited about. We used an entire string session. Like, we went out and had a string session in L.A. at Capitol Studios, and we did some really, really interesting things on some tracks that I’m really excited about, things we haven’t done production-wise. I’m just excited for people to hear the whole record, to be honest with you.\n\nIs this a record that you should listen to from beginning to end?\n\nThis is an album, and I’m really, really in love with the idea of making an album. I don’t really have much of an interest in having a few possible radio singles and then filling in the blanks with whatever you have. For me, putting out an album means that every song on that album has to be something that I thought was the best thing I’ve ever written when I wrote it.\n\nSo one of the other songs that’s on the album is “Sparks Fly,” which you’ve performed before and fans already love. Is it a special song?\n\n“Sparks Fly” is a song that the fans have been talking to me about in meet-and-greet lines for the last two years. So I revisited it, and I breathed some new life into it, lyrically and from a production standpoint. I’m really excited about the way it turned out.\n\nAre you looking forward to the promotional tour that’s coming for Speak Now?\n\nI’m really excited about everything that has to do with telling people about this album, because I’m just so proud of it. You know, promotion is all different—you’re never doing too much of the same thing. There are magazine shoots and interviews and talk shows and performances and concert specials. I like the variety of it, it’s definitely something you have to go into saying to yourself, I will not get tired. I will not complain. Because this is me going into it knowing that I’m going to work harder and faster and longer days than I will at any other point in the next two years. This is what I’m going to be now.\n\nThe last two years of your life have been so nuts. Is there a song that reflects the business and change of your last two years?\n\nThere is, actually. The last song on the album is about looking back on the last two years and how I feel when I do that.",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript]  A Swift Return\n\nTHE POP-COUNTRY STAR FOLLOWS LAST YEAR'S BIGGEST ALBUM WITH AN EMOTIONAL NEW CD ABOUT LOVE AND LOSS. SO WHO ARE THESE REVEALING SONGS ABOUT? By Tanner Stransky\n\nWHEN YOU WRITE lyrics about your own high\nprofile romances, there's an important extra step in the record-release process after writing and recording: deciding who needs advance warning. \"I feel like if I've written a song that will make their life better\"-an apology or a love letter, say \"then I'll definitely let the people know,\" says Taylor Swift, 20, whose engerly awaited third studio album, Speak Now, comes out Oct. 25. \"But I figure the people who get the more brutal end of the lyrical spectrum-they'll know. I don't have to tell them.\"\nSwift's deeply personal songwriting is a big part of her appeal, and fans won't be disappointed by her new dise; all of the songs are inspired by real events (no word yet on whether she addresses the Kanye West-VMAs incident, however). \"The album is a collection of confessions-things I wish I had said when I was in the moment,\" says the singer, whose last dise, 2008's Fearless, won the Album of the Year Grammy. \"You walk away and know exactly what you should have said.\"\nGiven Swift's much-discussed recent romances- she's been linked to Twilight hunk Taylor Lautner and Joe Jonas-the big question will be who inspired each of these new tunes. Sorry: She won't spill. \"You can't ask me that!\" she says with a laugh. \"But I think most of the songs are self-explanatory about who they're about. I can't write songs without them being detailed.\"\nShe describes Speak Now as a two-year diary covering everything from her \"ten- dency to run from love\" in first single \"Mine\" (already a top 10 hit) to \"the anxiety and conflict and awkwardness you feel when running into an ex in public\" in \"The Story of Us.\" \"Back to December,\" she says, is the \"first time I've ever apologized to anyone in a song.\"\n\"I was careless with a boy's heart, and I shouldn't have been.\" (She reportedly broke up with Lautner around Christmas last year, which may or may not be a coincidence.)\nThe title track was inspired by a friend who watched as a longtime love married someone else. \"I wrote that song about the moment in a wedding where you speak now or forever hold your peace,\" says Swift. \"I remember saying to her, 'Are you going to speak now?\" I started to think about it on the way home: what it would be like to be in love and know they're marrying someone else. That night I had a dream about one of my ex-boyfriends getting married. The next morning I wrote the song.\"\nSwift penned around 30 tunes for Speak Now, although only 14 made the final cut. Clearly it's been an emotional couple of years. \"There are a lot of things everybody saw me go through,\" she says, \"and then there are a lot of things people have no idea I went through, and I wrote about. I feel like I've been dealt a pretty good hand of inspiration.\"\n\nBONUS: KANYE AND TAYLOR: A VMAS REUNION?\nChelsea Handler, who'll host the MTV Video Music Awards on Sept. 12, hopes to reunite Swift and West on stage (both are scheduled to per form). \"It would be really good for them to do it,\" she says. \"Who knows if they'll agree?\" Reps for the artists declined to comment, but we'd certainly love to see them make up- and then move on. -TIM STACK",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Behind Taylor Swift's sweet tunes is a mature 20-year-old with a big career focus. She talks about personal lyrics, her awkward childhood, and why she'd rather stay in with a DVD\n\nYou know the phrase \"taking lemons to make lemonade\"? Well, you could say Taylor Swift is the living embodiment of that principle. Teased while growing up, she managed to take the bullying and the love-life dramas and turn them into emotionally charged anthems that have you thinking, \"Um, is she inside my head or what?!\". On her second album, Fearless, she even managed the seemingly impossible feat of making country-meets-pop cool.\nWith her much-awaited follow-up album, Speak Now, set for release this month (a concept album on which Taylor has said, \"Each song is a different confession to a person\"), and her new single, Mine, being released early due to the massive demand, we chat to Ms Swift to find out just how she keeps her cowboy boots planted so firmly on the ground in spite of her uber success.\n\nYou're back with your first single Mine, What's it about? \n\"This song is about real love, and navigating your way through a relationship. It touches on the fact that I've always run from love before, because you see it fail, and end, and hurt people so often. I wrote this song about finding someone who made all of those doubts go away, and what that relationship would look like.\"\n\nAre you nervous about following up the massive success of your last album, Fearless? \n\"I think about making music I'm proud of before I think about how many albums it will sell in the first week. I always hope for the best and I'm competitive with myself, so that drives me to try to write better hooks, deeper concepts, and more detailed lyrics than 1 ever have before, Competing with myself\nto continue writing honest, personal songs is actually really invigorating.\"\n\nHow does it feel to be riding this huge wave you're on? \n\"It's a lot of fun I'm doing exactly what I've wanted to do ever since I was a little girl. My dream was to put my thoughts and feelings into my music. I'm writing about things that most people can identify with, and I feel that I can connect with audiences on a very personal level.\"\n\nYour songs are very personal. Is that your trademark? \n\"I think so. It's almost like you're reading my diary except that It's put into music. So I think people can appreciate that I'm exposing some of my deepest feelings and talking about things that are meaningful. I often write from a place of pain. It could be something that I've observed or something that's happened to me. Even when i was 12 or 13. I would write about relationships and break-ups, just from what I saw around me. I've never needed drugs or alcohol to bury my feelings. Music has always been a wonderful release and an escape\"\n\nYou've spoken a lot about having felt like an outsider at school in Pennsylvania. How did that experience affect you? \n\"I hope it made me stronger. It was pretty rough being treated that way and not having any friends and being isolated. But I've spoken to many people who have experienced that kind of thing and what's Interesting is that, usually, that kind of rejection makes you want to accomplish more and prove yourself. I think I've always stayed true to myself and wanted to make my mark with music.\"\n\nYou've written several hundred songs and you manage your own career. Where does that drive come from? \n\"I'm not sure. It was something that I knew I wanted to do and that! wanted to work hard at. I always had a good work ethic. When I was in school, I was always focused on my writing and songs, and a lot of people didn't like that When other girls were going to parties and trying to be wild, I was more interested in working hard. I'm glad I made that choice rather than trying to fit in and be one of the popular girls I feel like I've always tried to be a very responsible person and I've always worked hard for what I wanted.\"\n\nMany of your tracks are about love and heartbreak. Is that what you feel most intent about in terms of expressing your feelings to an audience? \n\"Well, heartbreak is never fun! [Laughs] But I don't think I've experienced any more rejection or romantic disappointment than other girls my age have [gone] through. I basically like to write songs about relationships like to write about boys and I love to write about every aspect of love. It's really fascinating to me how many angles there are to a break-up. But it can also be inspiring to write about how it feels when you're falling in love with someone, when you've just gone on the best date ever and you write a song about it. I think capturing that moment in time is really important and really fun. I'm just fascinated by the whole relationship thing and that's my avourite thing to write songs about.\"\n\nYou were only 15 when you signed with Big Machine Records rather than a bigger label, because you wanted to focus on your own music rather than cover other people's songs... \n\"My goal was to define myself by performing my own work because writing is such a huge part of me. I knew that writing and performing my own songs would be something that would set me apart, so I wanted to be with a smaller record label that believed in me and what I was trying to accomplish. It was also exciting to work with people who needed me to help them succeed. as much as I needed people to help me develop my music and reach an audience. It's all worked out beautifully.\"\n\nHas there ever been a point - with all your Grammy Awards and No.1 singles - that you've said to yourself,\"Hey, I've made it!\". \n\"No, no I feel like this is just the beginning. I have a lot of work ahead of me and there are lots of goals i want to accomplish and new goals to be set. I love to work hard and want to keep pushing myself to evolve musically and add more layers to my work. I still feel I'm pretty young and so much lies ahead of me. It's fun.\"\n\nDoes touring ever grind you down?\n\"Sometimes I get tired, but I love being on the road and feeling the energy and love from an audience. I embarked on my first headlining tour last year and every show was sold out, and I'm thankful to my fans for being there. I've opened up for a lot of country headliners, and having had the chance to feel that crowd screaming for me, and at a volume level I've never experienced before, was amazing. I never want to get to the point where success and award nominations seem like stuff that happens every day. My parents taught me that the world doesn't owe you anything and you have to work for everything you get, and you have to be appreciative of success\"\n\nDoes it ever get annoying when people say you're a goody-goody?\n\"I don't care about that kind of criticism because I'm proud of who I am and being someone who's responsible and who works hard every day. I've never been a party girl and I'm not interested in going out to clubs and being wild. I'm laid-back I'd rather cuidie up at home, eat ice- cream and watch DVDs of my favourite TV series than go out on the town and get wasted. That's not my style\"\n\nDid you always know you had a talent for writing? \n\"I didn't think about it. Writing has always been something I've felt this need to do. It comes naturally and it's my way of expressing myself. So much of my singing is about expressing emotions and telling people things about myself or feelings about them that I could never say face to face.

      "Transcript/Content": "[Translation & Transcript by me] America's sweetheart, Taylor Swift, poses for us. And she surprises. She changes look: she becomes bolder and more rock, elegant and (a little) spacey. And she reveals her passion for fashion, some styling tricks (yes, even how to wear a tuxedo jacket) and the secret to being liked by the world. Which is? Have a star attitude.\n\n1. Which style do you interpret easily?\nWearing glittery and sparkling evening dresses comes naturally to me, the kind that stand out. But I also know how to wear girly dresses, maybe with a retro vibe.\n\n2. How do you dress when you want to feel different?\nI play with a totally opposite look, almost androgynous: I'm wearing a black tuxedo jacket.\"\n\n3. What do you pair with it? \nI could write an essay about it! So, I usually pair it with a pair of shorts, bold, thick tights, a T-shirt and a pair of Oxford shoes. In the evening, however, I pair it with skinny jeans and I wear high-heels or knee-high heeled boots. In this case, I wear a black bodice [missing word] Other times I pair it with a glittery skirt. a sparkly [missing word] and high heels. I know a thing or two about wearing my blazer...\n\n4. Where do you shop?\nWhen I travel I like discovering the local fashion. I go to every little shop, but I also like shopping to Urban Outfitters, Apostrophe and Topshop\n\n5. What was your last purchase from Topshop?\nAh, I always buy T-shirts with weird or fun prints. The last one I go has a maxipanda on it. I wear it with leggings, or a skirt, or skinny jeans with lace-up shoes.\n\n6. What's the last deal you made?\nI have a passion for vintage stuff and antique shops. In an antique shop I bought a key, one of the old-fashioned ones, I hung it on a chain and created a necklace of my own.\n\n7. Who are your favorite designers?\nI'll make a list. I love Cavalli, Dior, Kaufman Franco and Rick Owens.\n\n8. Is there a person you admire for their style? \nCharlize Theron, she is elegant and chic.\n\n9. What have you got yourself recently?\nSo many socks: they have become my obsession. And a woolen hat with a soft pompom. This will be the highlight for the winter- \n\n10. How do you transform a day look into a night look?\nA touch of red lipstick: it's instantly an evening look.\n\n11. What do you always pack in your suitcase when you travel?\n-I never forget my necklace collection. I like the ones by Lulu Frost, they look vintage. Sometimes I even wear more than one, I overlap them.\n\n12. And what other accessories define your look? \nI love bracelets, but unfortunately I can only wear them on my left wrist, otherwise I wouldn't be able to play the guitar. I also like hair accessories such as headbands, ribbons, especially for the evening. Ah, I almost forgot, hats! If I have a bad hair day, they are my salvation: I put my hair under my hat and voilà!.\n\n13. What is the piece you have in your closet that makes you feel more comfortable?\nThe one I call a \"to go to\" sweater. The one I always carry it with me wherever I go. And navy blue, with a wide and slightly oversized neckline.\n\nFloating quotes:\n\"Having charm means not feeling inadequate if you enter a room and realize that everyone has flat shoes while you are the only one with high heels... You have to be confident.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Translated from French by Christian B ♥] We know about her thanks to Kanye West last year. But at nearly 21 years old, the wise and sophisticated young woman breaks sales records with every one of her albums. We met and interviewed her in Nashville, the ‘domain’ of the country-pop singer.\n\nBy Marion Renard. Photos by Sebastien Micke.\nShe is a writer, composer, and performer – and holds on, more dearly than anything, to her pride. But who brought Taylor Swift into the scene of singer-songwriters, a genre largely ignored where we live, in Europe? Kanye West – with one of the many grand incidents he has now had, during the MTV Awards ceremony. It was September 2009, when the young singer received the award for ‘best video’ that the rapper took the microphone, arguing that Beyonce’s was better. Almost immediately, the name of Taylor Swift, then unknown outside of the USA, found itself in all news and internet sites and began to interest young women all over. All can comment on her looks in beauty magazines, can talk about her, even if no one can say the title of even one of her songs! That’s the magic of business.\nTaylor Swift is big – very big. And Nashville is ugly – very ugly. Taylor Swift is reasonable, wise, pays attention to her image – she could have been a Scout. She never drinks, never smokes – never takes a single step in the wrong direction. We have never seen her drunk in scandalous photos – never. Taylor Swift likes simply to speak of love and call out her exes, sometimes settling accounts in her songs. In “Forever & Always”, written in 2008 for Joe Jonas who broke up with her over the telephone in 27 seconds. The class.\nOn her new album, Speak Now, of which we will only listen to four tracks on an iPod under the expectant gazes of managers, we might glean that “Back to December” was written for her ex, Taylor Launter, and might wonder if “Dear John” was dedicated to John Mayer, with whom she collaborated a little (but still too much) last year. (“Dear John, I see it all know that you’re gone / Don’t you think I was too young to be messed with?”)\n\n\nTaylor Swift welcomed us to the suite of a grand hotel in the capital of the country, but still we would have liked to see her speak more naturally. “Thank you for coming here. Your magazine is very beautiful,” she said. (Waow beautiful, it’s great, thank you so much). “I learned French very young but unfortunately I haven’t retained it. I have dreamed of coming to Paris. It appears so romantic, so magnificent! And the Mont-Saint-Michel! I would like to pass a lot of time there. It is like a picturesque castle.”\nWhat pushed you to make music at such a young age?\nAt six years old, I had my first LeAnn Rimes CD and I became addicted. At ten years old, I realized that I did not have to do the same thing as my father, an agent. At eleven years old, I encouraged my parents to take me to Nashville because I had seen a special broadcast on Shania Twain and Faith Hill that said they had gone there and, by doing so, succeeded in the music industry. My mother took me on a one-day trip that Summer and I knocked at the door of many labels with my demo CD where I sang karaoke songs! I wasn’t signed by any of them, and it impressed on me how enormous the industry is and how competitive the market is. At that point, I took it upon myself to learn to play guitar and to write my own songs. That was what changed everything.\nWas it hard to be taken seriously?\nI knew I needed to work a little more than everyone else to gain respect because I was trying to compete with people who had double the resources and were trying to do the same thing. One of the things that brings me the most pride is that I was established at the age of 13 and that I had made relations with some publishing houses until I chose a contract. And I was one of many – I was the youngest artist signed at Sony. It was my job and I took it very seriously. Every day I went to school, but I was thinking all the time about ten or fifteen ideas all related to writing. I did not want it to be said of me that I succeeded with my hands in my pockets. I began to make friends with lots of songwriters. And a little while later, I was signed at a record label.\nYou are already releasing your third album and you have so many things to say about… love!\nThis one is about the best and the worst that has come to me over the last two years. Love, of course – relationships – because there are also stories that everyone in the world knows about me, but there is also a hidden side they haven’t seen before. This album is very much an album of confessions. There’s a song about someone I met in the music industry that I had a crush on. I say, “Please don’t be in love with someone else, please don’t have somebody waiting on you.” On the way back I wondered if I’d see him again, and I was so affected I decided to make a song about it. And, no, he never became my boyfriend, though we did meet again. We’ll see…\nAre you currently single?\nMy current single is called “Mine”. Oh, are you asking if I’m single? (Laughs) In general, I don’t speak of that because the moment the interviews and the papers go out, I am usually no longer in the same situation. (In later news, she went out with Toby Hemmingway. They met on set of the Mine music video.)\nYour kind of music isn’t very popular in Europe. Did Kanye West make you well known here?\n(Her head just lowers. This is a strange lingering habit of the press toward her.) Oh no, Marion. That’s the oldest story in the book. We don’t talk about it anymore.\nAlong the way, would you consider making pop music?\nFor me, music does not have to belong to a specific genre. There are other guidelines that help me, like the things I make with songs. I write about my life, my loves, and my relationships. It’s universal, no matter what language you speak or what country you come from. Everyone in the world falls in love. As long as I keep singing about it, the actual style of the music isn’t very important.\nAfter having played in Hannah Montana and Valentine’s Day, do you hope to have a career in cinema?\nMusic is my number one priority right now. I had a small role in Valentine’s Day (with Julia Roberts and Jennifer Garner, where she met Taylor Lautner) but it was very cool. I would like to be in a historical film, with the costumes and everything…\nYou’re a fan of fashion, and it doesn’t seem easy to dress up in Nashville. What do you do?\nI have a great stylist who brings me things from Los Angeles and New York. I’m lucky that way! I have loved fashion since I was small. I experiment a lot, with retro and feminine looks, and sometimes more chic with a blazer. I really like Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Topshop, Dolce & Gabanna, and Kaufman Franco, who design most of my dresses. \nWhat do you have to say about your friendship with Miley Cyrus? Is she your BFF?\nFriend, not BFF. We are very busy so we don’t see each other frequently, but when we meet, we always speak. We have known each other for some years now. My BFFs are Selena Gomez, Emma Stone, and Hayley Williams from Paramore. I see them as much as I can. But the three are spread out across the globe: Selena in LA, Emma in New York, and Hayley in Nashville, when she is not on tour.\nWhy is it so important for you to be considered a writer?\nWriting my own music was what helped me consider becoming a musician. I write music everywhere, in elevators, in hotels, in airports, in my room, on napkins… anything I can find in front of me.\nYou’re not really a party girl like Britney Spears: are you really ‘Little Miss Perfect’?\nIt’s true that I don’t go out a lot to bars and clubs. In America, you don’t have the right to drink until you’re at least 21 years old and I don’t want to find myself in trouble. Frankly, I go often to concerts, I invite friends to my house, I make music. I would really like to keep control of my actions. I have gained the trust of my fans and I don’t want to ruin that. That type of behavior is not my style. I have never been fascinated by party girls, but I don’t judge them. To each their own!",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Confronts Mayer, Laments Lautner In New Album\nPosted Mon Oct 18, 2010 11:56am PDT by Chris Willman in Our Country\n\n\nWhatever the reactions to Taylor Swift's third full-length album, Speak Now, might be, there are two critics whose responses we can easily pin down in advance.\nTaylor Lautner is going to love it.\n\nJohn Mayer? Not so much.\n\nThe hotly anticipated album, which comes out Oct. 25, has been held tightly under wraps until now, with only a handful of songs made available for advance listening even to journalists who have been doing interviews with Swift. Now that her label is finally starting to play the album for select critics, it's easy to fathom why its contents have been closely guarded, all fears of leakage aside. Some of the lyrics are startlingly candid, even by the standards of Taylor \"Naming Names, Taking No Prisoners\" Swift.\n\nAnd listening to \"Dear John,\" the scorching song that is-from all appearances-aimed at Mayer, all we can say is: Joe Jonas, you got off easy.\n\nWhen I talked with Swift last month after hearing a few of the new songs, she didn't hesitate to frame Speak Now as her diary of the last two tumultuous years. The general public might have to guess which relationships or incidents most of the songs are about, but the subjects of the lyrics will quickly recognize themselves, she feels confident.\n\n\"They're all made very clear,\" Swift told me. \"Every single song is like a roadmap to what that relationship stood for, with little markers that maybe everyone won't know, but there are things that were little nuances of the relationship, little hints. And every single song is like that. Everyone will know, so I don't really have to send out emails on this one.\"\n\nBut, I said, by necessity of her fame and that of her recent boyfriends, she is past the point of using proper names in the lyrics now.\n\n\"Um,\" she responded, \"there's still names that I used. Wait till you hear those.\"\n\nActually, there's only one actual name called out anywhere in the 14 songs. So if you were thinking that \"Dear John\" takes its title strictly from the old expression \"a dear John letter,\" you might want to think again. Swift is nothing if not extremely literal.\n\nWith most serious singer-songwriters, it might seem voyeuristic to speculate on the personal situations being reflected upon in song. But Swift has lived her life as a fairly open book, all but inviting her fans to relate her well-known relationships to their own as she evidences a gift for writing in both autobiographical and universal terms.\n\nAnd it might seem sensationalistic to focus on \"Dear John\" at the expense of the rest of the album if it didn't feel like it might be her masterpiece to date, or at least the most bracingly, joltingly honest song you've heard any major performer have the nerve to put on record in years. Maybe not since John Lennon took on estranged partner Paul McCartney in \"How Do You Sleep\" has a major pop singer-songwriter so publicly and unguardedly taken on another in song. But while Lennon's song came off as mean-spirited, Swift was motivated by vulnerability and woundedness, which makes her song far braver... and more cutting.\n\nThe first chorus begins: \"Dear John/I see it all now that you're gone/Don't you think I was too young/To be messed with/The girl in the dress/Cried the whole way home/I should've known.\" A second version of the chorus includes the lines: \"It was wrong/Don't you think nineteen's too young/To be played/By your dark, twisted games/When I loved you so.\"\n\nWhen rumors of a Mayer/Swift romance broke, some of us had a hard time imagining it, because of his rather famously ruinous reputation in matters of love and her ever-present, protective mom. \"Dear John\" addresses that: \"My mother accused me of losing my mind/But I swore I was fine...\" And: \"You'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand/And I'll look back in regret I ignored what they said/'Run as fast as you can'.\"\n\nSwift, who turns 21 in December, won't outrightly acknowledge the subjects of these songs-except for \"Innocent,\" the one written to Kanye West-so we have to allow that maybe \"Dear John\" is about some other much older man her mother warned her about who is known for \"all the girls that you run dry,\" and not the 32-year-old Mayer... Like, the late John Forsythe, maybe? Hmm. Gonna have to stick with our original educated guess on this one.\n\nThere may be those who'll accuse Swift of exploiting her own romantic travails in this and other songs. But the extended bridge section of \"Dear John\" (and, at six and a half minutes, the entire song is fairly extended) packs such a cathartic punch, it really does transcend any tabloid associations. When Swift sings \"I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town,\" anyone who ever felt manipulated or used and found the strength to move on may be cheering like it's the 4th of July.\n\n\"Dear John\" is the most powerful song on the album, but hardly the only vivid or emotional one. It's not all vituperation, though. The apologetic \"Back to December\" can't be about anyone but Lautner, and to our ears, so are several of the other new tracks-none of them about revenge, all of them about fondness for the admittedly brief time spent together. While Swift was writing these songs, Lautner's pointy werewolf ears must have been burning nonstop, to the point of spontaneous combustion. He has to be as flattered as Mayer should be flabbergasted.\n\nWhile you wait for Speak Now's release on Monday, here's a bible on what to expect from the hour-plus album, from first track to last.\n\nMINE\n\nThe opening track and first single is already practically a standard, having been rush-released way back on August 4, in response to a leak. Who's it about? Definitely not one of Swift's longer-term steadies, but a shorter-lived crush. (If you had to attach a name to it, it could be Glee actor Cory Monteith, whose are-they-or-aren't-they-dating friendship early in 2010 never seemed to amount to much. Or, it could be about an infatuation so short-lived we never got to hear about it.)\n\nI asked Swift how \"Mine\" fit with the true confessions theme of the album, since the bits about marriage clearly go beyond the sphere of sheer autobiography.\n\n\"It actually is a confession of some sort,\" she responded, \"because this is a situation where a guy that I just barely knew put his arm around me by the water, and I saw the entire relationship flash before my eyes, almost like some weird science-fiction movie. After I wrote the song, things sort of fell apart, as things so often do. And I hadn't talked to him in a couple months. And the song came out, and that day I got an email from him. And I was like\"-she claps her hands-\" ‘Yes!' Because that one was sort of half-confession, and half-prediction or projection of what I saw. And the fact that it came across so clearly to that guy that he would email me meant that I had been direct enough.\"\n\nHow did the fellow in question take to realizing that their brief flirtation had resulted in an entire fantasy of togetherness, arguing, falling apart, and married reconciliation-ever-after? Swift suddenly became coy. \"Um... I don't know. I didn't really respond. But he was sort of like, ‘I had no idea... I realize I've been naïve.'\"\n\nSPARKS FLY\n\n\"Sparks Fly\" is apparently the oldest song on the album, having been performed live-and leaked to the web via a crude concert recording-back in 2008. So hardcore Swift fans are familiar with the bones of this song, if not yet the revised lyrics and arrangement. The chorus is still the same as in the live bootleg that's circulated among fans for a couple of years, but some of the verses have been changed. Among the new lyrics: \"My mind forgot to remind me you're a bad idea.\" Some of the changes make the protagonist of this upbeat song a bit cockier than before. A line that once went \"Something that'll haunt me when you're not around\" has had a role-reversal switch, so that she now promises to give her b.f. \"something that'll haunt you when I'm not around.\" Apparently she's a little more confident of her charms than she was two years ago.\n\nBACK TO DECEMBER\n\nThis song, which was already released on iTunes, doesn't leave many doubts about who it's addressed to, since Swift broke up in Lautner last December. It's been widely noted that it's her first \"apology\" song. She is, after all, known more as the singer of \"Picture to Burn\" than for writing songs acknowledging that maybe it's her picture that should've been burned. But she emphasizes that, for her, repentance was no mere lyrical exercise.\n\n\"I've always sort of felt like I try to write songs that the people that they're about deserve,\" she told me. \"And up until now I haven't really felt like I really, really needed to apologize to someone and someone deserved that from me. It's just necessary. From knowing the situation and writing honestly, I can't leave that part out, and I don't think I should. And I think that you should be able to say that you're sorry to someone, and sometimes the best way I know how to say anything is in a song... I think that for me, especially playing that song for the first time for people around me, like my family and my friends, they made that point right away-like, ‘You realize you've never done this before. You've never really apologized to someone in a song.' I guess I wasn't conscious of that when I was writing it, because it just was exactly what I needed to say. It wasn't like ‘Oh, I haven't covered this emotion yet.' It was just a new emotion for me to feel.\"\n\nSPEAK NOW\n\nAlso already released on iTunes, the title track is the frothiest song on the album, at least sonically, with Swift trying out an uncharacteristic vocal style that's closer to Feist than her usual, more conversational approach toward singing.\n\n\"The song was inspired by the idea of bursting into your ex-boyfriend's wedding and saying ‘Don't do it'-which was originally inspired by one of my friends and the fact that the guy she had been in love with since childhood was marrying this other girl,\" she explained to me. \"And my first inclination was to say, ‘Well, are you gonna speak now?' And then I started thinking about what I would do if I was still in love with someone who was marrying someone who they shouldn't be marrying. And so I wrote this song about exactly what my game plan would be...\n\n\"When titling an album,\" she explained last month, \"for me the first step is I go down the titles of the songs I have so far, and see any of those titles could be the recurring theme throughout the entire record. At this point I had probably 70% of the songs that ended up being on the album. And I just kept going back to ‘Speak Now,' because I think it's such a metaphor, that moment where it's almost too late, and you've got to either say what it is you are feeling or deal with the consequences forever. And I feel like that's such a metaphor for so many things that we go through in life, where you can either say what you mean or you can be quiet about it forever. And this album seemed like the opportunity for me to speak now or forever hold my peace.\"\n\nDEAR JOHN\n\n\"The girl in the dress wrote you a song...\" Yes, she did. (See introduction.)\n\nMEAN\n\nBy far the country-est song on the album, not to mention by far the country-est tune she's ever done, with an abundance of mandolin and banjo. It's easy to imagine this becoming a theme song or rallying cry for the growing anti-bullying movement. Verses like \"Calling me out when I'm wounded/You, picking on the weaker man\" and \"You have pointed out my flaws again, as if I don't already see them/I walk with my head down, trying to block you out\" leading to a triumphant we-shall-overcome-the-mean-girls-(and-boys) chorus.\n\nSaid chorus could count as a case of backwards projection, flashing back to Swift's pre-fame life: \"Someday I'll be living in a big old city/And all you're ever gonna be is mean.\" But there is a definite allusion to recent controversies when, toward the end of the song, she adds: \"And I can see you year from now in a bar talking over a football game/With that same big loud opinion, but no one's listening/Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things/Drunk and talking all about how I... can't... sing.\" Snap!\n\nTHE STORY OF US\n\nEarly fan speculation, based in preliminary teases about the content of the tune, was that this one was about Joe Jonas. But she wrote about Joe on her last album, in \"Forever and Always.\" Do we think she's going to devote a song to him at this late date any more than the New York Times is going to feature on-the-scene reporting from the Spanish Civil War?\n\n\"That was the last song that I wrote on the record,\" she told me, \"because it happened most recently. It was at an awards show, and there had been a falling out between me and this guy, and I think both of us had so much that we wanted to say, but we're sitting six seats away from each other and just fighting this silent war of ‘I don't care that you're here.' I don't care that you're here.' It's so terribly, heartbreakingly awkward.\"\n\nObviously, the wound was fresh, so even though Swift did run into Jonas at a couple of awards shows this year, it seems much more likely to place its setting as the People's Choice Awards in January, where Swift and Lautner were reported to have successfully avoided each other, just three weeks after breaking up. Key lyrics: \"I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how/I've never heard silence quite this loud.\" Also: \"I would lay my armor down, if you would say you'd rather love than fight.\"\n\nNEVER GROW UP\n\nNo, this isn't another song about Kanye West. (Good guess, though.) Though this one could also be called \"Innocent,\" it's sung to an actual baby. \"Never Grow Up\" is a sweet lullabye with an undercurrent of sadness or even wary adult bitterness, as Auntie Taylor advises the infant whose nightlight she's turning on: \"To you everything's funny/You've got nothing to regret/I'd give all I could, honey/If you could stay like that.\"\n\nENCHANTED\n\nThe most unabashedly romantic song on the album, and also one of the best, \"Enchanted\" describes the aftermath of meeting a special someone without knowing whether the instant infatuation is at all reciprocated.\n\n\"That song is about pining away for if you're ever going to see someone again-walking away too early,\" she explained. \"It was about this guy that I met in New York City, and I had talked to him on email or something before, but I had never met him. And meeting him, it was this overwhelming feeling of: I really hope that you're not in love with somebody. And the whole entire way home, I remember the glittery New York City buildings passing by, and then just sitting there thinking, am I ever going to talk to this person again? And that pining away for a romance that may never even happen, but all you have is this hope that it could, and the fear that it never will.\n\n\"I started writing that in the hotel room when I got back. Because it just was this positive, wistful feeling of: I hope you understand just how much I loved meeting you. I hope that you know that meeting you was not something that I took lightly, or just in passing. And I think my favorite part of that song is the part where, in the bridge, it goes to sort of a stream of consciousness of ‘Please don't be in love with someone else/Please don't have somebody waiting on you.' Because at that moment, that's exactly what my thoughts were. And it feels good to write exactly what your thoughts were in a certain moment.\"\n\nApparently, nothing came of this enchantment, except for the song. At least that's the impression given by how Swift acknowledges the guy in question hasn't heard it yet, though she expects him to recognize that it's about their brief encounter when he does hear it. \"I think so,\" she said with a slight laugh. \"Using the word ‘wonderstruck' was done on purpose,\" she added (referring to the line \"I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home\"). Because that's a word which that person used one time in an email. And I don't think I've ever heard anybody use that term before, so I purposely wrote it in the song, so he would know.\"\n\n(And now every guy who ever ran into Taylor Swift at a social event in New York is thinking: \"I did say 'wonderstruck,' right?\")\n\nBETTER THAN REVENGE\n\nA fast-paced rocker in the tradition of vengeance songs like \"Picture to Burn,\" but aimed at a Mean Girl. \"She underestimated just who she was stealing from...\" Indeed. \"I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling/She thinks I'm psycho because I like to rhyme her name with things.\" Speaking of rhymes, the chorus rhymes \"she's an actress\" with \"better known for the things she does on the mattress.\" Parting thought: \"You might have him, but haven't you heard?/You might have him, but I always get the last word.\" Oh, we imagine \"she\" heard, whoever she might be.\n\nINNOCENT\n\nSwift premiered this song about Kanye West at the scene of the crime-the MTV Music Video Awards. \"I think a lot of people expected me to write a song about him. But for me it was important to write a song to him.\"\n\nJudging from how flawlessly Swift pulled off her subway performance of \"You Belong With Me\" shortly after the Kanye incident, it was easy to surmise that she just brushed it off like the preternatural pro she is. But that's hardly the case. \"The fans in the subway know exactly what happened that night. It's something I'm never gonna forget. And I'm always going to look back and smile on how they really, really helped me through that.... I'm so emotional and human.\n\n\"You have to try really hard to regulate what you feel, what you let in, and what you don't. Because things like criticism, you are told to be very thick-skinned about things like that. But then when it comes to making an album, if you make everything general and kind of gloss over your actual raw feelings, that doesn't benefit anyone... As far as what to feel and what level to feel it, I can't really control any of that. It's just how things hit you, and what you let in is definitely something you've got to find a balance for.\"\n\nHAUNTED\n\nThe most musically dramatic song on the album has effervescent-oops, make that Evanescence-qualities, with strings bumping up against squalling guitars, to underscore the romantic obsession being described. \"Something's gone terribly wrong/You're all I wanted,\" she sings, demanding at one point late in the song: \"Finish what you started!\"\n\nLAST KISS\n\nA much more tender post-breakup song than the desperate one that precedes it in the lineup. Best lines: \"All I know is, I don't how to be something you miss.\" And: \"So I'll watch your life in pictures/Like I used to watch you sleep...\" Now, that's haunted.\n\nLONG LIVE\n\nHard to imagine there's any way the closing number isn't about Lautner, if the ongoing affection she's publicly expressed for him is true (not to mention the remorse heard earlier in the album in \"Back to December\"). She describes herself and her paramour in heroic terms: \"The crowds in the stands went wild/We were the kings and the queens/And they read off our names...\" That may strike some listeners as self-important for a celebrity to have written, but later in the song, Swift describes things more in the terms of a homecoming king and queen than Hollywood royalty, saying: \"You traded your baseball cap for a crown/And they gave us our trophies/And we held them up for our towns.\"\n\nTaken at its word, the song would seem to have been written during this moment of mutual triumph, but the conquistador attitude occasionally gives way to bittersweet prophecy, as Swift sings, \"If you have children someday, when they point to the pictures, please tell them my name...\"\n\nSomehow, we have a feeling the guy's kids aren't going to have a hard time deducing on their own who the blonde girl is. If there was any doubt, Speak Now helps ensure she'll have a spot in the history books and not just a faded teen-pop photo album.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Talks About Her Album Speak Now, Her Hits “Mine” And “Speak Now,” And Writing Her Songs\nOctober 11, 2010\n\nBy Bill Conger\n\nTaylor Swift has what a lot of us wish we could get–a do over. It’s those moments that pass you by when you wish you had something wise or witty to say but instead greeted the situation with an inadequate response or just a blank smile. With a guitar and her songwriting muse to guide her, the 20-year-old country music sensation is able to relive those occasions and envision in hindsight what could have been spoken. That’s the concept behind Swift’s third CD, Speak Now, a collection of tunes that will be released on October 25th.\n\n“In life you have a lot of situations that pop up and people that come into your life, and sometimes you don’t get to tell them what you wish you would have told them,” Swift said. “This album is my opportunity to do that track-by-track. Each song is a different confession to a different person.”\n\n“Some of the things I wrote about are things everyone saw me go through,” she added. “Some of the things I wrote about are things nobody ever knew about. I’m beyond excited for you to hear these stories and confessions.”\n\nWhile Swift keeps mum about her personal life in interviews, she speaks volumes through her music. Since the release of Fearless in 2008, she has captured her life in song, journaling her life in detail through words and melody.\n\n“I like to take a lot of time between albums to work up the next one to see what it is,” Swift explained. “For me, I write everything that I live so you’ve got to give yourself a little bit of time to live a lot of things, so you can write about a lot of things. Thankfully, in the past two years, I’ve experienced a lot of things that I’ve been dying to write about.”\n\nOne story listeners are already hearing is “Mine,” the album’s first single and her most recent Top 10 Billboard chart hit, about what Swift calls her tendency to run from love.\n\n“For me, every really direct example of love that I’ve had in front of me has ended in goodbye and has ended in break-ups,” Swift confesses. “I think I’ve developed this pattern of running away when it comes time to fall in love and staying in a relationship. This song is about finding the exception to that and finding someone who would make you believe in love and realize that it could work out, because I’m never ever going to go past hoping that love can work out. I’m always going to be very hopeful and blindly optimistic when it comes to love even if it does seem like it’s really something that is very hard.”\n\nTaylor Swift\nTaylor Swift\nSwift has been feeling the love of her fans as they have anxiously awaited her new music. They have watched as Taylor has been crowned with numerous accolades and honors including the most awarded album in the history of country music. The six-times-platinum Fearless is the only album to ever win the all-genre Album of the Year Grammy, along with Country Album of the Year trophies from the Grammy’s, Country Music Association, Academy of Country Music, and American Music Awards. She also is the youngest singer to win Entertainer of the Year from the Country Music Association. Swift has sold more than 13 million records, had more than 25 million digital downloads, sold-out concerts, and topped the charts several times with “Should’ve Said No,” “Love Story,” “White Horse,” and “You Belong With Me.”\n\nIn the summer fans were treated to a scheduled 13-hour meet and greet with the singer/songwriter at the 2010 CMA Music Fest, and it was at that event that Swift felt fans gave her the green light for one of the album’s cuts, “Sparks Fly.”\n\n“So what about ‘Sparks Fly’?” fans asked Swift at the meet and greet. ‘Is it going to be on the next record?’ “That was a comment that I kept getting over and over again. I played that song at maybe one or two shows, and you guys just jumped on it and really made it something that I had to put on the album because you guys really showed an interest in it. That’s one of my favorite things about you all is that you really tell me what you like, what you’re feeling and what you’re thinking.”\n\nSometimes the choice isn’t that obvious for the Wyomissing, PA native. Whenever she begins a new album, each song is a keeper at first.\n\n“My favorite thing to do is to make a list of what the album would be as I keep writing even when I’m in the beginning stages of writing the album, and I’ve got like thee songs on the list,” Swift said. “I still make a list of what track listing that would be like, which one will be one, two or three. You keep writing more songs. All of a sudden you have got a list of 25 songs. What I would do is I would keep bumping off songs that I felt I had out written, and knock them off the list so that you keep updating the list. As you keep writing songs, your list gets better and better and better. I did that so many times I can’t even count.”\n\nThen, Swift turns to some insider advice to guide her through the daunting responsibility of which songs should make the final cut\n\n\n.”Every song that I write is about someone, about a certain emotion. In picking the songs, you have to be pretty aware of who is reacting the best to which of your songs. I’ll play my songs for people in my life, people like in my band (Abigail), I’ll play them for my mom; I’ll play them for people who I really, really trust their opinion and I know they’re going to be completely honest if they don’t like it, because that’s just as important as someone saying they like it. The ones that would get the best reactions are the ones I would put on the record.”\n\n“Nathan [Chapman, her co-producer] and I are always talking about how may the best song win. It can’t be personal. It has to be personal when I write it, but when it comes to picking them I can’t be like ‘but no that one’s more special to me.’ I don’t get my feelings hurt when it comes to picking which one makes the record and which one doesn’t.”\n\nFor her latest album, Swift wrote all the songs herself.\n\n“It just sort of happened that way,” Swift explains. Like I’d get my best ideas at 3:00 a.m. in Arkansas, and I didn’t have a co-writer around so I would just finish it. That would happen again in New York and then again in Boston and that would happen again in Nashville. The song that made the cut for the album were songs that I wrote by myself, so wish me luck,” she adds with a laugh.\n\nBeing a top tunesmith, Swift has a special affinity for songwriters and offers this bit of advice. Know who you are writing the song about and then write a letter to them.\n\n“That’s why I listen to music because it says how I feel better than I could and it says what I wish I had said when the moment’s there,” Swift said. “Be as direct as you possibly can. If you need to dial it back later, I guess do that. If you can in your songwriting, be as detailed as possible, because for people to relate to it they may not have the same details in their relationship that you had in yours but they can relate in that they had these little details to their relationship too. The more honesty, the better; the more details the better; the more direct, the better.”\n\nBill Conger is a freelance writer for various publications including Bluegrass Unlimited, GACTV.com, Bluegrass Music Profiles and ParentLife.

      "Transcript/Content": "Ladies Home Journal Catches Up With Taylor Swift\nOctober 12, 2010\nBy: CountryMusicIsLove\n\nIn anticipation of her new album, Ladies Home Journal caught up with Taylor Swift to get her answers to some interesting and fun questions. Read below for their interview with Taylor…\n\nWhy I Called My Album Speak Now…\nMy songs are like open letters. They say everything I wished I had said when certain people were standing right in front of me. I imagine I will be getting a few text messages from them once the album comes out.\n\nMy album in three words…\nDiverse. Detailed. Relationship-y. I’m turning relationship into an adjective.\n\nMy Writing Process…\nI have an app on my iPhone that’s a voice recorder. I’ll be in the middle of a conversation and will literally walk away and record a bridge, a pre-chorus or half of a hook, then go right back to the conversation like nothing happened.\n\nWho I’d Most Like To Collaborate With…\nJay-Z. I know our genres are completely different, but there could be something cool about that.\n\nNow That I Have My Own Place…\nI’m most excited about throwing dinner parties and cooking for people. The other night I made this dish with chicken, penne and capers that I am so proud of.\n\nWhat I Took From My Parents’ House…\nLittle teacups, a Geisha doll and a crystal ball that looks like a fortuneteller’s. Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve wanted that crystal ball — so my mom gave it to me and I let her keep one of my Grammys.\n\nMy Signature Dish…\nCaramelized bacon. My Mom and I both make it. It’s really easy to do, but people seem to be wonderstruck by it.\n\nMy Favorite Hobby…\nAntiquing. At the Tennessee State Fair Grounds, I found a hog carrier that I now use as a table for my record player. And I found a long animal trough that I use to store blankets.\n\nWhy I Love Nashville…\nWhen I’d first visit, I was mystified that people talk to you in public, make eye contact on the street and smile at you and wave. Now, I’m addicted to that. I’ve never felt so completely like a town was home as I do here.\n\nWhat I’ll Do For Beauty…\nI really like eyeliner. One time I was waking up on a plane, it had been a long flight and I didn’t have eyeliner — so I used a Sharpie. I file that under my road warrior adventures.\n\nMy Make-Up Must-Haves…\nCoverGirl has these outlast lip stains that I really like — I have about five in my purse. I’m always throwing my hair around on stage and if I wear sticky lip gloss, my hair gets stuck on my lips — which is a total mess.\n\nHow I’ll Celebrate My 21st Birthday…\nMaybe I’ll have a glass of wine — but nothing too hardcore for me. I’ve never had the burning desire to drink. I need to be in control of what I say, and if I drank, I’d stress out about saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.\n\nGrowing Up On A Christmas Tree Farm…\nMy Dad always liked to let me think that I was helping. So, when I was 6 he gave me the job of picking the praying mantis pods off of the Christmas trees so that they wouldn’t hatch in people’s houses. I loved it!\n\nOn My Life List…\nSeeing my album in Starbucks. I really love Starbucks. I go there every day and I just stare longingly at the CDs they sell. I?m so envious.\n\nWhat I Look For In A Guy…\nSomeone who loves you for who you are. I like doing cute art projects with glitter, and there have been guys who’ve made me feel like that’s weird. But then there are guys who find it endearing.\n\nFavorite Thanksgiving Tradition…\nEating the marshmallows in the candied yams.\n\nMy Hollywood Crush…\nTaylor Lautner. It’s always going to be Taylor.\n\nTaylor will release Speak Now on October 25.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift on Growing Up, Her Big Romantic Regret and More \nOctober 14, 2010 – 12:57 PM\n\nIn the October 24 issue of PARADE magazine, pop princess Taylor Swift opens up about the challenges of staying grounded while living her dream. Here are some highlights from the exclusive interview.\n\nOn her love life.\n“Things change so quickly. I have no idea who’s going to be a recurring character and who’s just a guest star for one episode. Love is fascinating. Wishing for it, pining for it, and the anger that comes when you lose it. I used to think that I could figure out some pattern to love, like if you don’t text a guy back for a half hour, he’ll like you more. But there is no pattern. Absolutely nothing is predictable in love or in life.”\n\nOn the bittersweet mea culpa “Back to December,” from her new album Speak Now.\n“Guys get what they deserve in my songs, and if they deserve an apology, they should get one. There was someone who was absolutely wonderful to me and I dropped the ball, and I needed to say all that.”\n\nOn how she stalked a fan in Nashville one day.\n“I was driving near the mall and I saw this girl with my tour T-shirt on. She was probably 11. I made a U-turn and tried to follow her—I really had to do some maneuvering. I found her in a video-game store and just kind of walked up to her and said, ‘Oh, hi. I wanted to meet you.’  She had no idea what to say for about three minutes. Then her mom walked over, burst into tears, and proceeded to tell me that they’d driven all the way from Austin, Texas, just to see where I was discovered.”\n\nSee exclusive photos from our photo shoot with Taylor\n\nOn her own fame.\n“I don’t like to feel like I’m some fragile package that has to be shipped by high-priority mail and handled with white gloves.”\n\nOn dropping in on a journalism class at the University of Kansas, where her best friend from high school is a junior.\n“I just kind of walked in and sat down and tried to learn something. Even if you’re happy with the life you’ve chosen, you’re still curious about the other options. Sometimes I will make a glass of iced tea and watch life go by. I chose one road and didn’t choose the other, but I can still see what that one looks like. In the past year I figured out that happiness is what everybody wants more than anything. Now I think if you’re in the middle of your day and you realize you’re just happy in the moment, you should celebrate that.”\n\nPhotos: Taylor Swift’s Red Carpet Style\n\nOn growing up.\n“I still have mixed feelings about what growing up is — this thing that happens to everyone, so I’ve heard.”\n\nOn the pain of being a teenage outsider.\n“If I was going through a really tough day at school and I didn’t have anyone to talk to or sit with at lunch, I would say to myself over and over again, ‘It’s okay because I can write a song about this later.'”\n\nOn her fear that listeners won’t connect with her songs.\n“That’s definitely a nightmare that I wake up from sometimes. Saying things in songs that people will care about is my biggest hope, and saying things that nobody will care about is my biggest fear.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Full, My Transcript] Taylor Swift pulls a sweater over her knees. She’s seated on a black leather couch in the lobby of Big Machine Records in Nashville, and the office is a bit chilly for the short, frilly skirt she’s wearing.\n\nDespite the brisk temperature, this room holds distinctly warm memories for the 20-year-old singer. A handful of framed wall-hangings provide a mini-retrospective of her career, including a multiplatinum award for her last album, 2008’s “Fearless.” The Big Machine lobby is, in fact, a significant reminder of just how far she’s traveled in her quick rise from unknown teen to global star.\n\nWhen she was still a 16-year-old high school student, there was nothing on the walls in this room. Swift remembers sitting on the floor in the early summer of 2006, stuffing promotional CDs of her first single, “Tim McGraw,” into envelopes destined for radio stations around the country.\n\n\"With every envelope that I would seal I would look at the address and the station on there and think, ‘Please, please just listen to this one time,’ \" she recalls. \"I would say a little message to each envelope: ‘Please, whoever gets this, please listen to this.’ There’s no promise when you’re putting out your first single that people are even going to listen to it.\"\n\nNot only did the single get heard, it opened the door to sales of more than 4 million copies of her self-titled debut album, awash in songs about broken hearts and high school social dramas. Her sopfantastic friendre set, “Fearless,” did even better, selling 592,000 copies in its first week, according to Nielsen SoundScan, on its way to more than 6 million sales. Three of the songs reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 — a rare feat for a country artist — as she commanded multiple magazine covers and even a 2009 MTV Video Music Award nomination and win. When that VMA acceptance speech was infamously interrupted, fiery Kanye West controversy quickly supplanted the inspirational, dreams-really-do-come-true storyline in her career narrative.\n\nWeeks after the VMA shocker, the Country Music Assn. (CMA) presented Swift four awards, including entertainer of the year. In January, she won four more times at the Grammy Awards, with “Fearless” claiming the all-genre album of the year trophy.\n\nWith every sector of the business jittery about the future of the album, the music industry’s eyes and ears will be focused quite closely on Swift when Big Machine releases her third project, “Speak Now,” on Oct. 25.\n\nBeing heard is no longer an issue. Now the questions are about being heard at the right time and the volume with which the public might react. An online leak forced Big Machine to rush-release the first single, “Mine,” in August. It has since sold more than 1 million downloads. The title track, a quirky lyrical exercise that blends the dashed-wedding scenarios of “Runaway Bride” and “Friends in Low Places,” debuted at No. 1 on iTunes by selling more than 85,600 downloads on its first day of release, Oct. 5.\n\n\" ‘Speak Now’ is the first thing we’ve put out that didn’t leak, including an album cover,\" Big Machine president/CEO Scott Borchetta says.\n\nThose leaks are a symptom of the anticipation that exists for the album. The label has shipped more than 2 million copies of the CD. No album has sold more than 1 million copies in its first week since Lil Wayne’s “Tha Carter III” crossed that threshold in June 2008. As album sales continue to slide, a big debut week for Swift would be an encouraging sign.\n\n\"It will do whatever the market will bear,\" Borchetta says, carefully avoiding a specific number. \"When we have 2 million units in the field, you’re not going to have a problem finding it.\"\n\nThe attention hasn’t gone unnoticed by Swift, who does her best to distance herself from any expectations.\n\n\"I have a lot of anxiety about things on certain days, but I have anxiety because I care,\" she says. \"It’s not anxiety that’s crippling. It’s a five-minute conversation with myself about if a [sales] number really defines this piece of art that I’ve created and what that means, and what the number’s going to be. I try to predict what it’s going to be, and then I realize that I can’t predict what it’s going to be, and then I sit there and say something to myself like, ‘Well, you’re happy today. Enjoy this and be proud of the music that you’ve made.’\"\n\nLADIES FIRST\n\nTo date, Swift’s music has been somewhat atypical for a country singer. The genre’s radio stations primarily target adults 25-54. Her youth-based lyrics made her a hit with her teen peers, but the music tested poorly among 35-plus males, according to one country radio veteran. Oddly enough, however, even that portion of the audience still liked Swift’s personality and the music’s ability to help some families bridge generations.\n\n\"Adult females use country music radio to do two things,\" says Keith Hill, founder of the UnConsultant. \"They use it for their own personal enjoyment, and in many cases, we see young women using CHR and hot AC products to stay in touch with their daughters.\"\n\nThose daughters found Swift on multiple radio formats, and the singer now finds her boots aligned in both pop and country camps, an awkward balance in the current cultural landscape. Physical product still makes up more than 80% of country buyers’ purchases, and in that context, the sales of “Mine” easily eclipsed all other country releases during the third quarter. It sold nearly 400,000 more copies than the quarter’s No. 2 single, Sugarland’s “Stuck Like Glue,” which racked up 634,000 downloads.\n\nStill, “Mine” is off the pace of some other lead singles from major pop albums in the last year. Eminem’s “Love the Way You Lie” sold 2.7 million during its first nine weeks, Katy Perry’s “California Gurls” netted 2.6 million, and Lady Gaga’s “Bad Romance” tallied 1.8 million.\n\nSwift and Big Machine have kept her country base in their cross hairs, repeatedly suggesting in the months leading up to the album’s release that the new Swift material will have an outlook that demonstrates an increasing maturity. She cites Kris Kristofferson, Faith Hill, Emmylou Harris and Paul McCartney among her creative role models, and none of those artists earned long-term success by playing to teens.\n\nFears that she would remain trapped thematically in Hendersonville (Tenn.) High were, according to one rival label president, obliterated with the first line of “Mine,” which references college in the opening phrase.\n\n\"She left home, she’s living on her own now, and she’s seeing the world in a different way after growing up a bit,\" producer Nathan Chapman says. \"There’s probably some more grown-up things that she’s dealing with, and that comes out in the songs.\"\n\nThat change is echoed in Swift’s performance.\n\n\"There’s a maturity in her voice,\" country WKLB Boston PD Mike Brophey says. \"It’s less a teenager singing and more a young woman singing. There’s a more consistent sound in her vocals.\"\n\n\"Mine\" was a turning point in the album’s development. Swift and Chapman had begun recording new songs almost as soon as \"Fearless\" was released. The two cut demos in his basement studio and would only take those songs to larger facilities once they felt they had an emotional foundation in the basic tracks. Still, it wasn’t until early 2010 when the album truly began to coalesce. Swift presented \"Mine\" to Borchetta in his office, just a few doors down the hall from the leather couch in the lobby.\n\n\"We probably played that song four or five times,\" Borchetta recalls. \"I’m jumping around playing air guitar, she’s singing the song back to me, and it was just one of those crazy, fun, Taylor teen-age moments.\"\n\nAnd then it got serious.\n\n\"I said, ‘Keep going,’ \" Borchetta says. \"She kind of looked at me like, ‘You’re challenging me.’ And I said, ‘Yeah. You’ve found true north here. Keep going.’ \"\n\nIt was some time in the period after that challenge — between February and June — that Swift wrote “Innocent,” her response to the Kanye West incident.\n\nPublic opinion had turned dramatically on the rapper. West tweeted in September 2010 that he “bled hard” because of his actions. He canceled a tour, had to let employees go and was called a “jackass” by the president.\n\nTaylor Swift Deems Kanye West ‘Innocent’ at VMAs\n\nInstead of piling on the venom with the song, Swift’s “Innocent” takes a conciliatory tone, painting him as “32, and still growing up now.”\n\n\"Who you are,\" she sings in forgiveness, \"is not where you’ve been.\"\n\n\"It took a while to write that song,\" Swift says. \"That was a huge, intense thing in my life that resonated for a long time. It was brought up to me in grocery stores and everywhere I went, and in a lot of times in my life, when I don’t know how I feel about something, I say nothing. And that’s what I did until I could come to the conclusion that I came to in order to write ‘Innocent,’ \" she says. \"Even then, I didn’t talk about it, and I still don’t really talk about it. I just thought it was very important for me to sing about it.\"\n\nMany took the conciliatory tone of “Innocent” at face value, but not everyone. The New York Times referred to it as “petty.” A Los Angeles Times critic called the lyrics “slams disguised as ‘forgiveness.’ “\n\nThose barbs were echoed in many online reader comments. They were, in fact, just the latest round of criticism that has been leveled at Swift, who has endured a backlash not uncommon to artists whose rise to prominence occurs at rocket pace. The 2009 CMA victories were accompanied by a negative outpouring over the female vocalist of the year honor in particular. The fallout was even more pronounced when Swift had significant pitch problems during a televised Grammy performance with Stevie Nicks.\n\nSwift was well aware of the feedback.\n\n\"I care about what everyone thinks of me, and I’m not afraid to say that,\" she says. \"There have been times when it’s absolutely leveled me and ruined my day. Then there are times when I can hear it and I’m kind of like, ‘Oh, I’ve heard that before,’ and I just continue on with my day.\"\n\nSwift’s recorded voice is stronger on “Speak Now.” The studio is a different animal than the concert hall, but her vocal presence is, on the whole, something that specifically concerns her. “That’s one of the areas that I have definitely put a lot of work into,” she says.\n\nBASE JUMPING\n\nPop success has often been a seductive trap within the country genre. Country artists who purposely aim at crossing over take a major risk: They could fail to engage the pop audience and offend their country base at the same time.\n\nSwift certainly pushes boundaries with some of the material on “Speak Now.” At least a half-dozen tracks employ classic-pop arcs with instrumentation that’s outside the norm for country, such as layered string productions or mechanized drum sounds. But the ultimate sonic outlet for the music wasn’t a conscious consideration when Swift and Chapman recorded the album.\n\n\"When we were making these songs,\" Chapman says, \"it was ‘What does this song need?’ as opposed to ‘How far can we push the line on one genre or the other?’ \" The producer describes one track on the album — \"Mean,\" which puts fiddle and banjo to prominent use — as \"the most country-sounding thing she’s ever done.\"\n\nSwift has generally endeared herself to programmers at country radio, which remains the most important means of exposure for the genre. She’s likely to receive a lot of latitude in her artistic expression, in great part because she’s been a successful ambassador for country.\n\n\"I’m one of the believers that if a song crosses over from country into another format, it’s a great way to turn attention to this format,\" country WGH Virginia Beach, Va., OM John Shomby says. \"I don’t think that can hurt.\"\n\n\"There’s always going to be an element of push-back to anybody that becomes really famous, whether it’s Kenny Chesney, George Strait, Reba McEntire or Rascal Flatts,\" Borchetta says. \"Part of our culture is we build heroes and then tear them down. Well, you’re going to have to have a little bit more in your gun belt to tear down Taylor Swift.\"\n\nFor all of her pop success, Swift has continued to show commitment to the country genre. When she bought her first condominium in 2009, she not only chose to stay in Nashville, she picked a home that’s less than one mile from Music Row. She invariably recognizes her country roots in awards acceptance speeches and participates routinely in the CMA Music Festival in meaningful ways. In 2009, she signed autographs for 13 hours.\n\n\"The music may sound [pop], but she has not run away from [country],\" Shomby says. \"It just happens that she’s crossed over and become an icon in that area, too.\"\n\nSwift is in no hurry to redesign her career path in other ways, either. She made her first forays into acting during the last two years, appearing on an episode of “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” earning positive reviews for her monologue and skits as a guest host on “Saturday Night Live” and making her movie debut in “Valentine’s Day.” Those experiences were appealing, but not enough to knock her off her current course.\n\n\"At the moment, I’ve just made space for putting out an album and then touring the world,\" she says. \"Maybe in a couple years acting would be a great thing to do, but there aren’t going to be any concert dates moved around for acting in the [near] future.\"\n\nWhat that tour looks like is yet unknown, though Swift has mapped out many of the production elements for her 2011 schedule.\n\n\"I already have drawings in my journal of what the stage should look like.\" she says. \"I know a few of the set list orders, [and] I want there to be an entire wedding scene on the stage.\"\n\nTaylor Swift Grows Up in ‘Mine’ Video\n\nThat fits nicely with the matrimonial setting of the album’s title track and the video for “Mine,” which includes a wedding scene. Her 2008 “Love Story” video also had a fairy-tale wedding setting.\n\n\"It’s very weird,\" she says of the nuptial undercurrent in her work. \"I’m not really that girl who dreams about her wedding day. It just seems like the idealistic, happy-ever-after [moment]. It’s funny that my wedding references have all been like ‘Marry me, Juliet,’ and on my ‘Speak Now’ album I’m ripping one to shreds.\"\n\nWhere Swift’s onstage weddings will take place is still to be decided. After headlining a pair of stadium dates in Boston and Baton Rouge, La., in 2010, she intends to do more venues of that magnitude this time around. Kenny Chesney booked as many as 13 stadiums in 2009, though she dodges specific numbers. “We’re still hammering out the final details,” she says. “Any comparison to Kenny is good, though.”\n\nUltimately, “Speak Now” could prove to be a pivotal album in Swift’s creative progress. Music history is littered with teen stars who were unable to maintain their commercial pace once they hit their 20s. But in most instances, those acts didn’t write their own material. Swift penned every song on “Speak Now” — often at odd hours on the road. In the end, that led her to write the entire project without enlisting any co-writers. Reflecting her growth thus became an essential component of the album experience.\n\n\"At one point, the record was not called ‘Speak Now.’ It was called ‘Enchanted,’ \" Borchetta says. \"We were at lunch, and she had played me a bunch of the new songs. I looked at her and I’m like, ‘Taylor, this record isn’t about fairy tales and high school anymore. That’s not where you’re at. I don’t think the record should be called \"Enchanted.\" ’ \"\n\nSwift excused herself from the table at that point. By the time she came back, she had the “Speak Now” title, which comes closer to representing the evolution that the album represents in her career and in her still-young understanding of the world.\n\n\"I’m just fascinated by people — how they live their lives, what they live their lives for,\" she says. \"It’s just a never-ending thought process for me about how we end up where we are — and where we’re going.\"\n",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: 'Maybe I should just lighten up'\nShe's the all-American country-pop superstar whose idea of letting rip is baking cookies. But, with a straight-talking new album and her 21st birthday imminent, is Taylor Swift about to reopen an old war of words with Kanye West?\n\nBy Craig Mclean\n\nThe celebrity wrestle that shocked the world took place on 14 September 2009. Well, it raised a few eyebrows, at least. In the bling corner: the hip-hop \"visionary\", fashion-plate and all-round ego-monster, Kanye West. In the gingham corner, the teen-queen of pop-country music, Taylor Swift. At the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) in New York, Swift had taken to the stage to accept the award for Best Female Video. She had sold 13 million copies of her self-titled 2006 debut album and 2008's follow-up, Fearless, had made Swift the youngest winner of the Grammy award for Album of the Year. Here was a wholesome heroine to America's adolescent girls, well on her way to becoming the biggest-selling digital artist in history.\n\nBut West, self-appointed oracle of all that is really dope, wasn't happy. As a wide-eyed and thrilled Swift attempted to give her thanks, West grabbed a microphone and told the assembled luminaries and viewing millions that Beyoncé was more deserving of the award.\n\nSwift – tall, blonde, peachy-clean and gowned like a teenager at her first posh do – gaped. The crowd booed. Sitting down the front, Beyoncé looked mortified. West strode off into another notorious night. Job done.\n\nRevenge, thinks Taylor Swift, is a dish best served acoustically, with some pointed lyrics. Last month she took to the stage in LA to perform at this year's VMAs. The singer, who secured her first publishing deal for her songwriting aged only 14, played a new, as-yet-unreleased song from her upcoming third album Speak Now. \"I guess you really did it this time,\" she cooed as she sat on a stool with her acoustic guitar. \"Lost your balance on a tightrope/ Lost your mind tryin' to get it back/ Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days? Always a bigger bed to crawl into... and everybody believed in you...\"\n\nThe song is called \"Innocent\". Is it all about Kanye West?\n\n\"You are just so direct!\" replies Swift when I put the question to her. Really, it's not that shockingly direct a question. But Swift was born and raised in rural Pennsylvania, the daughter of well-mannered, well-groomed, well-heeled parents (both worked in finance). She moved to Nashville with her family when she was 14. She may have become, in the four quick years since releasing her debut album, a multi-millionaire with, in America at least, a cacophonic celebrity status, comprising countless awards, magazine covers and a nascent Hollywood profile (she was in the romcom Valentine's Day). But Swift retains what we know as Southern manners, is demure and polite, and practically perfect in every way. At time of writing, her latest Tweet to her 4,401,654 followers is this: \"Baking pumpkin spice cookies with cream-cheese icing because I'm very excited. Because a new song is coming out on iTunes at midnight!\"\n\nShe may also be baulking at being put on the spot because this is her first full interview outside of America in support of Speak Now. She's such a superstar in her homeland that carving out time for this meeting has taken months to arrange. I am only allowed to hear four songs from her new album, once, 20 minutes before meeting her. I have to sign a pre-interview contract, promising not to kidnap her and sell her into white slavery or something.\n\nWe're sitting alone in a subterranean conference-room in the quietly plush offices of her Nashville-based label. Big Machine Records is housed in a plain-looking wooden house in the area of the city known as Music Row. Her sparkly image comes beaming at you from all angles. The walls groan with sales awards from the North American market, and a smattering of international honours. She has yet to sell serious amounts of records in the UK, although her November 2009 show at London's Wembley Arena was a 12,500-capacity sell-out.\n\nBeanpole-thin and lanky (she's 5ft 11in), Swift is dressed for autumn (\"My favourite time of year!\"), complete with grey beanie pulled tight on her springy curls.\n\n\"The song 'Innocent' is a song that I wrote about something that really, really emotionally impacted me,\" she begins. Ordinarily, Swift speaks with an almost spooky confidence. Sentences are fully formed and loquacious. Still, she's clearly spent extra time rehearsing this answer. \"And when something really big happens in my life and I have a million different feelings and emotions running through my mind throughout the course of the day, a lot of times it's hard to figure out what to say or what to write about it. Because you feel so much about it.\n\n\"And I was really grateful to get to perform the song on the VMAs because here I am, putting together this album that has this recurring, subtle theme running throughout it, that you need to say what it is that you feel when you know what it is you feel – at that moment.\" In fact, a week or two after our interview, a story runs around the world after Swift tells a US magazine, \"I imagine I'll be getting a few text messages from people [including, it seems, ex-boyfriends] once the album comes out.\"\n\nShe says she \"had a lot of options\" in the run-up to the awards ceremony. MTV's flagship awards show is a crucial PR platform for any performing artist, but she could have chosen not to attend. Or she could have seized that moment, done the obvious, and played \"Mine\", the first single from Speak Now. \"But I performed a song nobody had heard before, and I'm proud of that. Because it was the right thing to say.\"\n\nBecause she knew \"he\" would be there? Swift shoots me a silent but (I think) purposefully comic glare.\n\n\"It's important to tackle life head-on,\" she replies, with added saccharine sweetness that again, seems to be deliberately cartoonish. \"And there have been a lot of situations where I've kept to myself and not said anything when I don't know what to say. But when I know how I feel about something, I have to say that at that time.\"\n\n\"OK,\" I reply, adding that I'm going to assume that it's about West, who turned 33 this June. \"Your lyric '32 and still growing up' is the crucial piece of evidence.\"\n\n\"Is that it?\" she says with an arch of a manicured eyebrow.\n\nIs she seriously going to go round the world for the next two years denying that \"Innocent\" is about Kanye West?\n\n\"Did I deny anything here?\" she says lightly. \"I wouldn't deny you information like that,\" she adds with a playful smile.\n\nAs ginormous tween, teen and post-teen American cultural phenomena go, Taylor Swift is pretty cool. Yes, she's polished, poised and confident. The 13-year-old who trawled round Nashville's song publishers in search of a deal – and the 14-year-old who persuaded her entire family to up sticks for Nashville when she landed that deal – must have been a formidable force.\n\nBut she's different, too, from her peers of stage and screen. She has little of that robo-precociousness possessed by Disney stars such as Miley Cyrus, none of the vacuous celeb shine of Paris Hilton, and certainly none of the wheels-falling-off fame-demons of Lindsay Lohan. I've been to Cyrus's house, to a Milan fashion show with Hilton, and to Lohan's 18th birthday party, and have the weariness in my soul to prove it. Swift is way more functional, grounded, real. And talented.\n\n\"All my life, since I was about eight, all I wanted to do was be on stage,\" goes the opening instalment in her intensely busy, supremely focused potted bio. \"First it was children's theatre, and I was auditioning for all these musicals...\"\n\nThen she fell \"hopelessly in love\" with Shania Twain, the Dixie Chicks and Faith Hill. She watched a TV special on Hill which described how the 1990s' first lady of country had moved to Nashville \"and that's how she got discovered. So this little bell went off in my head and I automatically decided that Nashville was the place where dreams come true. The place you have to go. That was when I was about 10, and that's when I started the non-stop, 'Hey Mom and Dad, can we move to Nashville?'\"\n\nThat focus, it seems, was always there, and handed down from her parents.\n\n\"When I was younger, probably six or seven, I used to follow my dad around and say, 'I'm gonna be stockbroker like you,' and I had no idea what a stockbroker was, of course! ' But as I grew up, my parents would always just say to me, 'You can do whatever you wanna do in life – as long as you work hard to get there. You have to work hard for every single baby step that you get that is closer to what you want. And we will support that until you change your mind and want something else. And when you want something else, we will be your cheerleaders in that too.'\"\n\nMore than pop, hip-hop, R'n'B or rock, country music spoke to the pre-adolescent Taylor because \"I felt there were more stories told. And stories that I could latch on to and be on the edge of my seat [listening to] from the beginning of the song to the end. And,\" she sighs a little, as if she's had to justify her country tastes on many a previous occasion, \"my definition of country music is really pretty simple. It's when someone sings about their life and what they know, from an authentic place.\n\n\"And, you know, a lot of country artists sing about topics in their life that are authentic. One guy will write about how he grew up on a farm and fell in love and raised kids on that same farm. Some people sing about how, when they get sad, they go to the bar and drink whiskey. I write songs about how I can't seem to figure out relationships and how I'm fascinated by love...\"\n\nHer most famous relationship has been with Joe Jonas, of Disney's God-squad pop siblings the Jonas Brothers. He reportedly finished with her over the phone. What did she learn from that relationship? \"Well, the thing about my personal relationships is I usually feel much more comfortable talking about them in music. That's what I do. The only way that I know how to deal with anything in life, and process feelings and thoughts about anything that affects me, is to write songs about it.\"\n\nIt's a smooth answer, but one delivered with some sincerity. The only moment in our time together when Swift is anything like uncomfortable or caught off-guard is when I mention Dan Dymtrow. Hours before our 9am appointment, news had broken in The Hollywood Reporter that Dymtrow, her former manager, was suing her parents Scott and Andrea (who play a significant role in managing her affairs, although Swift herself seems to take the lead on most issues). He claims that he's owed \"millions\" in commissions – their professional relationship ended in 2005, just before she signed with Big Machine.\n\nI ask her: what can you say about Dan Dymtrow?\n\nSwift looks at me blankly. I tell her that he's taking her to court. She still says nothing. Her eyes widen and her mouth drops open.\n\nI say: sorry, to be clear, it's your parents he's suing. She leans back, aghast. Eventually, Swift says something: \"Wow.\"\n\nI say: you didn't know about that? She shakes her head, and looks, for a moment, like the sorrow-filled teen of many of her song lyrics. I feel bad. I feel like Kanye West. And not in a good way.\n\nTaylor Swift turns 21 in December. How will she be celebrating her birthday? \"I would love to have a Christmas-themed birthday party like I've always had – strings of lights and wreaths.\" Maybe, she concedes, she'll be somewhere like Belgium, working, that day – she admits that her itinerary is fixed for the next two years. \"But maybe I'll be in Nashville and I'll have a bunch of my band and crew and friends over.\"\n\nThis year she moved out of her parents' home in the nice Nashville exurb of Henderson and invested some of her country superstar millions in a large apartment in the centre of the city. Remodelled to her specifications, it features a \"person-sized\" birdcage suspended over a pond in her living-room. It's reached by a spiral staircase. There is also a balcony outside her bedroom, overlooking the living-room. She delightedly agrees with my diagnosis of her tastes – interior design by Shakespeare and Hans Christian Andersen – and explains that, \"It's just fun having the cage.\" She likes to watch Grey's Anatomy in it, and eat those pumpkin spice cookies.\n\nIf she does have a party, Swift won't be indulging, even though she will, finally, be of US legal drinking age. \"I don't drink because I don't really feel like it. It's not like I judge people who do [or that] I don't hang out with people who drink. I just don't really feel like it. Plus, it's not [been] legal.\"\n\nDoes she not like being out of control?\n\n\"I think that the reason I haven't really experimented with drinking is because I don't like to feel like I might say something that could hurt somebody's feelings. Or I might come off in a way that I can't control. Maybe I should just lighten up!\" she says, smiling. \"But for me, I just kind of do what feels right.\" She insists that, \"I don't live by all these rigid, weird rules that make me feel all fenced in. I just like the way that I feel like, and that makes me feel very free.\"\n\nSongwriting, she says, her eyes shining with bliss, is her other liberation. \"I write songs to figure out how to feel about something. And then that helps me get past it. I've been writing songs since I was 12, and when I started I would write about how my days at school were really lonely. And I would get through those days by saying to myself, 'It's OK cos I can write a song about this later, and then I'll feel better.'\n\n\"I've applied that saying and that phrase and that thought process to my entire life and every single intense shocking, nationally televised curveball that has happened.\"\n\nThe latter comment is another sly dig at poor old Kanye. Visiting the UK last month, the hip-hopper, vainglorious to the last, said this: \"Most people will be like, 'I guess it's OK Beyoncé's video didn't win.' That's not me. After the MTV thing, I quit doing music. I had to get back into the world's grace. I went to Japan, Hawaii, to get away. I thought I was going to give it all up. It's only through divine intervention that I am here today.\"\n\nMeanwhile, his sweet-smiling nemesis, has smarter, cooler, tougher things to say. The lyrics of \"Innocent\" find a young woman, almost half his age, telling him in simple and brilliantly dry terms: \"Grow up, mate.\"\n\nDoes she know what West makes of the song?\n\nShe sighs. \"It's such a long story. We would be here all day! I try not to go into it too much because, um, the story is very long and complicated.\"\n\nLet's guess. Did West (among his other character highlights, he's a notorious ladies' man) try to take her on a date to \"apologise\". She says nothing and smiles. \"Again,\" I say, \"you're not denying anything...\"\n\n\"It's just a long story,\" smiles Taylor Swift, the 20-year-old who knows that silence – and songs – speak louder than words and stage invasions.",

They drove through the orchard and bought the apples on the way out.” (Gyllenhaal, 29, paid the $3 tab.)\n\nIt was just the first stop of a romantic Big Apple weekend, which included a trip to a SNL taping and Sunday brunch in Brooklyn’s Park Slope neighborhood, as UsMagazine.com reported Monday.\n\nSays a source, “The relationship is very new, maybe two or three weeks old.

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: The country-pop star on the secret of her success By LOUETTE HARDING\n\nPrecocious musical talent, model good looks, multimillionaire status – 20-year-old country-pop star Taylor Swift leads a charmed life. But, as she tells Louette Harding, it’s the rejection and heartbreak she pours into her songs that have driven her to succeed…\n\nTaylor Swift\n'You learn lessons in how to treat people, and sometimes you learn them too late,' says Taylor\n\nEarlier this year, Taylor Swift used some of the estimated $50 million she\nearned by the age of 20 to buy herself a three-bedroom condominium in Nashville, and over the months she has put her stamp on it. ‘There is this fish pond like a moat around the central fireplace,’ she says. ‘The chimney rises to the ceiling like a tower and on one side of it is a spiral staircase going to a landing/conservatory in the shape of a birdcage.\n\nI sit in there all the time – it’s so fun.’ As a little girl, did she like fairy tales by any chance? ‘I was in love with the idea of fairy tales. My bedroom\nhas a balcony that overlooks the living area, Juliet-style,’ she adds. ‘Pretty shameless.’\n\nThe brazen girliness is but one aspect of this talented singer-songwriter whose country-pop second album was 2009’s bestseller in the US, and who already has three Grammys on display in that quirky living room. (There’s a fourth, but she gave it to her mum.) Her songs are heavily autobiographical, which adds a gossip-column frisson to the fun of decoding them. On her latest album, Speak Now, one track is about ‘running into a guy I used to be in a relationship with at an awards show’. (OK, I’m thinking – the subject of the song must be Joe Jonas of the pop-rock band the Jonas Brothers, or Taylor Lautner, the actor who plays the werewolf hunk in the Twilight vampire movies.)\n\n‘He was sitting a few feet away from me. There was this horrible awkward silent fight going on between us, not even glancing in the other person’s direction.’ So you never got to be friends? ‘No, that song is about a relationship that ended pretty badly.’ (Must be Joe Jonas, then, who ended their relationship in a 27-second phone call, whereas Taylor S and Taylor L – Taylor Squared as the US press dubbed them when they dated – are now supposed to be friends.) Taylor Swift’s music has that effect, taking you back to the idiocies and idealism of youth with a sigh and a chuckle.\n\nTaylor Swift\n\n\nWe are talking in a private members’ club in Nashville, the set for our photographs. In person, Taylor has the striking otherness of a supermodel: 5ft 11in, thin as a filament, with feline eyes which she has a bit of a complex about, thinking them too small, although in practice their imperfection saves her from mere prettiness. Already she is an old hand at interviews and has a few standard answers she rattles off, though she lacks the guile to disguise what she is doing. She is diligent and polite and bears the unmistakable reserve of the bullied child, wearing courtesy like an elegant armour. At least that’s how it seems to me, as the mother of a bullied daughter. When I mention this, Taylor’s guard drops like a curtain and there’s a sudden flash of raw affinity.\n\nShe is the sheltered product of doting parents, Scott, a stockbroker, and Andrea, who gave up her own high-flying career in financial marketing to raise Taylor and her younger brother Austin at their 15-acre hobby farm in Pennsylvania. Taylor remembers her early childhood as running free with tangled hair, riding horses. There were no close neighbours so theirs was a pretty self-contained family unit, with Andrea’s\nopera-singer mother providing the thrill of showiness. It was this grandmother who got Taylor hooked on singing and performing, so that she became a regular in children’s musical theatre shows and competitions. But when the family moved to a suburban neighbourhood, life changed from idyllic to ‘trying to fit in’.\n\nAged 12, her efforts came crashing down. She thinks her peers found her ‘weird’. I suspect that they were jealous of her growing success at local festivals when they had her patronisingly tagged as the tall, thin, pale kid who was no good at sports. One night, soon after she’d sung the national anthem at a professional basketball game, she rang round her friends to see if anyone wanted to hang out with her at the local mall. ‘That memory is one of those painful ones you’ll never fully get over,’ she says, emotionally. ‘At that point I’d been shunned from the group for whatever reason and I was still trying desperately to be included. That evening, I called them up and they each said no and Mom said, “You know what? You want to go to the mall, let’s go together.” And we ran into this entire group of girls who had told me they were busy that night. In situations like that my mum has known exactly the right time to run away. There are situations where you have to encourage someone to be tough and there are times when you should just run. So we got in the car and we drove to the mall that’s an hour and a half away but is a better mall.’\n\nShe says this with a small deprecatory laugh. ‘And we showed them in our own tiny way. We had a great time.’ And you wrote a song about it? ‘I did.’ ‘The Best Day’ reduced me to tears; Taylor is touched when I mention this – apparently it has the same effect on her own mother.\n\n‘Any time I feel heartbreak, I say to myself, “I can write\na song about this”’\n\n‘In school, I dealt with a bunch of different kinds of being alone,’ Taylor continues. ‘There’s being alone because no one talks to you. There’s feeling alone when you walk up to a table at lunch and you’re not welcome to sit down. There’s standing on a stage at a local festival with your acoustic guitar that’s as big as you and some kid from your grade screams obscenities at you. It’s school. It’s what everyone goes through at some point. And the only thing that got me through really tough days was writing songs about it. I would sit there on those lonely days and say, “It’s OK, because I can write a song about this later.” I’ve carried that mantra with me since: any time I feel pain, rejection, heartbreak, I subliminally say to myself, “I can write a song about this and then it will feel better.”’\n\nShe remains thin-skinned. She avoids reading blog comments about herself because of the random cruelty of the net. ‘It hurt me deeply in school and it hurts me deeply now.’ So Kanye West must have really touched a raw nerve: last year, the rapper stormed on to the stage to protest when she won ‘Best Female Video’ at the MTV Video Music Awards (he was rooting for Beyoncé). Did that feeling of public humiliation take her straight back to school? She shoots me a keen sideways glance and says by way of agreement, ‘It’s one of those things that impacted me really heavily and emotionally.’\n\nTaylor Swift\n\n\nShe says when she wrote her first song, aged 12 – a kid who loved writing poetry mucking about with three chords on a guitar – she knew instantly, ‘This was all I wanted in life. There wasn’t going to be a back-up plan.’ When I ask her what she wants in the medium-term, she says a stable relationship and to write books or songs, even if she is no longer recording them herself. And she suffers from the true writer’s ambivalence and detachment. ‘Sometimes in situations where life is happening to me, I’m looking for the metaphor and I’m wondering how to express my feelings in a chorus,’ she admits.\n\nShe was only 14 when Sony/ATV Music Publishing in Nashville signed her as a staff\nwriter. Her parents, who had nightly endured her nagging about moving to the country-music capital, then agreed to relocate, yanking an ever-tolerant Austin out of his school too. For a while Taylor co-wrote in her publishers’ offices after school (where her experience was less unhappy this time), then she spent her final year\n‘home-schooled’ (in reality studying in the back of cars) while she completed a radio tour. In 2006, her eponymous debut album was released on the independent label Big Machine Records, whose founder Scott Borchetta was prepared to take a risk on her. It went quadruple platinum. \n\n‘I’d been shunned by my peer group and was desperate to be included’\n\nThe follow-up album, Fearless, was even more successful. As a teetotal girl who shuns scandal she was condescendingly dubbed the ‘anti-Britney’. Speak Now is pitched at an older listener, but she is not about to lead her younger fans astray. During our photo shoot, as she reclined in a gothic dress slit to the thigh, her PR Paula whispered, ‘Too much leg!’ and Taylor immediately pulled the skirt closed.\n\nBut she’s more than just a transient teeny phenomenon. She is an alchemical combination. As well as the pleasing voice, the nice image, the songwriting brilliance, she is also an astonishingly intuitive businesswoman. She has created a Taylor Nation (an affiliation of fans’ websites) and her website encourages them to ‘pre-sell’ her new album online, with the promise of a meeting with their idol-princess for the most successful. It’s marketing that’s finely tuned to the youthful enthusiasms of the core of her fanbase. She has a management team of four, including her mother, who convene weekly to discuss the way ahead, but Taylor has the final say and many of the ideas are hers. ‘I don’t know if I would feel right handing decisions to other people and living with the consequences. Taking responsibility for your career is important if you want it to go in the direction you have in your mind,’ she says. There are Taylor backpacks, dolls, T-shirts, greetings cards. Her schedule to launch Speak Now involves crisscrossing the Atlantic and features all the big-hitting US television shows including Today and the Late Show with David Letterman. \n\nTaylor Swift\n\n\nShe feels she can only offer a boyfriend ‘what’s left over’, after giving ‘heart and soul on stage every night’. She admits she has only had three real relationships. She dated Jonas in 2008 and the breakup inspired her hit ‘Forever and Always’, to which he retorted with a song called ‘Paranoid’, like an adolescent revenge battle conducted through iTunes. A year later, she teamed up with Taylor Lautner on screen and off when she made Valentine’s Day, a brief and not entirely successful foray into acting. Rumour has it that the track ‘Back to December’ on the new album is a song of apology for dumping him. She says to me, ‘In relationships, you learn lessons in how to treat people, and sometimes you learn them too late. If you’re me, you go over in your head a million times what you would have done differently. This is a song expressing regret. Sometimes every voice in your head is screaming, “You need to apologise. This was not handled well. You hurt somebody.”’ So has the subject heard the song yet? ‘No.’ So you don’t know how he’ll react? ‘I don’t,’ she says in a small voice.\n\nShe senses my amusement that so many tracks have been written about so few Romeos. Just three relationships? (The third was with an anonymous schoolboy.) ‘I wasn’t factoring in the almost-relationships, and they’re almost more inspiring,’ she adds, wryly self-knowing. ‘Almost-relationships are very important to the writing process.’ This switch from girl to adult is an endearing trait: ‘I love not really knowing if\nI’m a grown-up,’ she says winningly.\n\nTaylor Swift\nTaylor in New Orleans performing at the opening game of the American football season in September\n\nWe carry on with the song-inspiration game by talking about the title track on Speak Now. ‘One of my friends was talking about how her ex was marrying another girl and how she was heartbroken over it. I said, “Are you going to speak now?” You know, speak now or for ever hold your peace; burst into the church. I then went home and had this terrible dream about an ex-boyfriend getting married and I woke up and immediately wrote my game plan should it become reality.’ She is laughing. I do not think Jonas or Lautner need to worry that she is truly going to interrupt a future wedding service. So is she single? ‘Yes. I’m not a mopy single girl. I wake up in the morning and think, “What do I need to do today?” and at no point do I think, “I need to find a boyfriend.”’ It’s a nicely acerbic comment and one prickling with the tension between naivety and independence.\n\nActually, the very mechanism behind her writing is a struggle towards maturity. She says, ‘For me, writing songs is a way of justifying things that happen in my life and making it seem as if they happened for a reason – if only to teach me something. If I can write a song then it almost becomes this golden-framed memory. It not only helps me understand why we feel pain, it makes me celebrate it afterwards.’\n\nShe says she would not be so driven if she hadn’t felt the need to scream ‘I’ll show you all!’ at the six girls who decided to reject her. ‘There are two ways you can go with it. You can let it destroy you…or you can use it as fuel to drive you: to dream bigger, work harder. I wasn’t invited to parties and I look back now and I’m so thankful that I was at home, playing the guitar until my fingers bled.’\n\nWhat about the girls involved? Have they ever been in touch? She nods. ‘I don’t think they even remember what happened. And when I see them sitting in line at my meet-and-greets wearing my T-shirts, I’m not going to walk up to them and say, “How could you do that?” Because look at how life has gone. They were there for a reason, and I’m happy about it.’",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] I am explaining to Taylor Swift why it's her fault I've broken my toe. (Long story. My son stole my computer to watch her videos; I chased.) She laughs-a goofy kid's \"ahuk- ahuk\"-and refuses to take the rap. But she wants to see the toe. \"Wow, I did exactly the same thing when I was ten!\" she exclaims, all five feet eleven inches of her scrunched over my foot. \"I was...well, I was going through a chubby phase. And my mom had ordered pizza. And I really, really wanted that pizza. When the doorbell rang I did, like, this...pizza sprint, and...\"—another collision, another black toe.\n\nWe have this bonding moment within two minutes of meeting each other, and in a sense it says everything about why this 20-year-old girl sells out stadiums in minutes when she tours: Taylor Swift wants to connect. And she does. While other singers of her generation are interested in being outrageous and promoting their uniqueness, Swift is intent on finding our commonality. Think about Fearless, the top-selling album in the United States last year; it's basically about boys and high school: \"She wears short skirts/ I wear T-shirts/ She's cheer captain/ And I'm on the bleachers.\" Kind of says it all, doesn't it?\n\n\"I write songs about relationships because that's what I think about,\" Swift says, over burgers and Diet Coke at a Nashville restaurant. She's wearing a loose, flowery dress and sandals, and is all inquisitive eyes and jutting angles. I think about what the cabdriver told me on the way to the hotel: that she, Carrie Underwood, and Kellie Pickler like to go watch the Nashville hockey team, the Predators, at the local arena- Swift used to drive there in the hot pink four-wheel drive her record company bought for her (which she later donated to charity)-and it's like \"a massive blonde attack.\"\n\n\"Relationships are fascinating and riveting and completely unpredictable,\" she continues. \"For me, love is everything.\" Hard to argue with, and certainly Swift's fans haven't. Her third album, Speak Now, came out in October; a single, \"Mine,\" leaked onto the Internet a few months early and almost immediately became the number-one-selling song on iTunes. Autobiographical? Check. About love and losing it? Check. But there's a growing sophistication here, not only in the lyrics (\"You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter/ You are the best that's ever been mine\") but in Swift's thoughts about love.\n\n\"I used to think there were all these rules for making people like you,\" she says. \"Like, the best way to get a guy to like you would be to actively ignore him. I was filled with advice! I'd tell friends things like, 'Don't accept that apology! That isn't sincere!' or 'He hung out with his ex-girlfriend? Get rid of him.' But love is never that simple. Now I'm finally getting the idea it's the one thing I don't need to have a strategy for. I can only write the material I know, which is what happens to me,\" Swift continues. \"And luckily I've had a crazy two years. Not just careerwise, but emotionally, too.\"\n\nEach song is about a different person in her life: \"the wonderful and beautiful and inspiring,\" she says, and \"the heartbreaking\" as well. In that latter category we find Joe Jonas; in 2008, he and Swift dated, and Jonas famously broke up with the singer during a 27-second phone call. She wrote a song about him, \"Forever and Always.\" His band answered with a song about her, called \"Much Better,\" of which she says cheerfully, \"I was not on the positive end of the 'much better.\"\" (Sample lyric: \"Get a rep for breakin' hearts/ Now I'm done with superstars/ And all the tears on her guitar.\")\n\nAlso a popular question: What about that Kanye West/MTV Video Music Awards kerfuffle back in 2009? I dance around the topic a little bit-I mean, how many times can this poor girl be asked about the same moment?-but I show her an interview she did with Allure in 2008 in which she said the artist she was most dying to work with was...Kanye West. She does a deep sucking-in-of- breath. \"I forgot about that! Oh, wow! That's...wow, that's eerie, isn't it?\" Typically, she's processed this not with a shrink but with lyrics. She sang about West at this year's MTV VMAs in \"Innocent\": \"Every one of us has messed up too..../ I hope that you remember. Today is never too late to be brand-new.\"\nIt is emotional angst, not career angst, that is Swift's métier. Not that what she's doing is musically is new- far from it. Swift has been mining that territory since she was 12 and first started writing songs about \"pining away,\" as she puts it. \"I'd Lie\" was a song about the son of her English teacher who was captivated by-well, not by Swift, anyway; she sang it at a talent show while he was in the audience.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift reaches out to fans, and they to her\nBy Randy Lewis, Los Angeles Times\nNov. 4, 2010 12 AM PT\n\nShare\nIn the fractured world that is pop music in 2010, 20-year-old country-pop star Taylor Swift has proven that the day of 1-million-plus first-week album sales hasn’t completely disappeared by selling 1,047,000 copies of her new “Speak Now” CD out of the gate.\n\nThat makes it the fastest-selling album in more than five years, since March 2005, when rapper 50 Cent’s “The Massacre” moved 1,141,000 units. Since that time, overall album sales have dropped nearly 50%.\n\n“It’s an incredibly rare feat,” Keith Caulfield, associate director of charts for Billboard, said Wednesday. “Even if you put aside the depression of the music market, and look back over the last 20 years, this has only happened 16 times, including this week. That’s already a staggeringly tiny number.\n\n“Thinking of it in terms of where we are today,” he said, “it speaks volumes as to her popularity, how she engages her fans and how she engages with more than just one hot single; it’s more about the whole package.”\n\nSwift’s album easily dislodged Eminem’s “Recovery” album as the first-week sales champ of 2010. That collection sold 741,000 copies when it was released in June. “Speak Now” also surpassed Lil Wayne’s “Tha Carter III,” the last album to top combined physical and digital sales of 1 million in its first week, with 1,006,000 copies in June 2008.\n\n“I think this shows that when we do it right, we can still get hundreds of thousands of people to line up and buy [an album] the first week,” Scott Borchetta, head of Swift’s Nashville-based label, Big Machine Records, said Wednesday. “There are so many factors behind why certain things are happening and why certain things are not happening in our industry: what the real unemployment level is, the fact we don’t have record stores anymore … . We attacked all of that. You can’t do that with every release, but you can do it with superstars.”\n\nThat marketing push followed a relatively quiet summer for Swift. In the last two weeks she has gone on a media blitz to promote her third album.\n\nShe appeared on NBC’s “The Today Show,” CBS’ “Late Night With David Letterman,” ABC’s “Live! With Regis & Kelly” and “ Dancing With the Stars,” while daytime talk show host Ellen DeGeneres gave over her entire Nov. 1 show to Swift and the new album. Swift also is currently on the cover of Glamour and People magazines, and had cover stories in the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times and Parade magazine the day before the album’s Oct. 25 worldwide release.\n\nLast Friday she shut down Hollywood Boulevard with a surprise midday free concert atop a double-decker bus outside the Kodak Theatre. She serenaded JetBlue Airways passengers last week at JFK airport in New York with a free show, and spearheaded “Read With Taylor Swift,” a Scholastic 90th Anniversary Literary event telecast to 25,000 classrooms, to an estimated audience of 1 million students. She gave Target Stores an exclusive expanded version of the album that the mass merchant is supporting with a $7-million TV ad campaign. Universal Music Group, the parent of Big Machine Records, also persuaded outlets including Starbucks and Rite-Aid stores to carry the album.\n\n“What people are telling us is that you need to stay engaged,” Borchetta said. “I’m not sure you can go away now for three years, as far as that fan base is concerned. If fans find you on Facebook or somewhere else online and you haven’t given them a message [recently], you will lose them; they will go elsewhere.”\n\nAdded Caulfield: “It’s not just about being engaging. There are a million artists who are super personal and super engaging who will not sell this many albums in their lifetime, let alone in one week. It’s the combination of engagement, personableness, the way all the songs are coming from her [and] that her fan base is very widespread: She has young and old: Moms are buying it at Walmart on the weekend, and the 13-year-old girls who want to be Taylor are buying it on iTunes.\n\n“The takeaway from this could be that 1 million copies in a week is still achievable, and it doesn’t mean that anyone can do it,” Caulfield said. “But if you have all the right systems in place, and a perfect artist like Taylor, it’s still possible.”\n\nrandy.lewis@latimes.com",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Bespoke TAYLOR\nPrecocious musical talent, model good looks, multimillionaire status - 20-year-old country-pop star Taylor Swift leads a charmed life. But, as she tells Louette Harding, it's the rejection and heartbreak she pours into her songs that have driven her to succeed... >> Photographs JOSEPH ANTHONY BAKER\n\nEarlier this year, Taylor Swift used some of the estimated $50 million she earned by the age of 20 to buy herself a three-bedroom condominium in Nashville, and over the months she has put her stamp on it. 'There is this fish pond like a moat around the central fireplace,' she says. 'The chimney rises to the ceiling like a tower and on one side of it is a spiral staircase going to a landing/conservatory in the shape of a birdcage. I sit in there all the time-it's so fun.' As a little girl, did she like fairy tales by any chance? 'I was in love with the idea of fairy tales. My bedroom has a balcony that overlooks the living area, Juliet-style,' she adds. \"Pretty shameless.' The brazen girliness is but one aspect of this\ntalented singer-songwriter whose country-pop second album was 2009's bestseller in the US, and who already has three Grammys on display in that quirky living room. (There's a fourth, but she gave it to her mum.) Her songs are heavily autobiographical, which adds a gossip-column frisson to the fun of decoding them. On her latest album, Speak Now, one track is about 'running into a guy I used to be in a relationship with at an awards show. (OK, I'm thinking-the subject of the song must be Joe Jonas of the pop-rock band the Jonas Brothers, or Taylor Lautner, the actor who plays the werewolf hunk in the Twilight vampire movies.) 'He was sitting a few feet away from me. There was this homible awkward silent fight going on between us, not even glancing in the other person's direction.' So you never got to be friends? \"No, that song is about a relationship that ended pretty badly. (Must be Joe Jonas, then, who ended their relationship in a 27-second phone call, whereas Taylor Sand Taylor L-Taylor Squared as the US press dubbed them when they dated -are now supposed to be friends.) Taylor Swift's music has that effect, taking you back to the idiocies and\nidealism of youth with a sigh and a chuckle.\nWe are talking in a private members' club in Nashville, the set for our photographs. In person, Taylor has the striking otherness of a supermodel: 5ft 11 in, thin as a filament, with feline eyes which she has a bit of a complex about, thinking them too small, although in practice their imperfection saves her from mere prettiness. Already she is an old hand at interviews and has a few standard answers she rattles off, though she lacks the guile to disguise what she is doing. She is diligent and polite and bears the unmistakable reserve of the bullied child, wearing courtesy like an elegant armour. At least that's how it seems to me, as the mother of a bullied daughter. When I mention this, Taylor's guard drops like a curtain and there's a\nsudden flash of raw affinity.\nShe is the sheltered product of doting parents, Scott, a stockbroker, and Andrea, who gave up her own high-flying career in financial marketing\nto raise Taylor and her younger brother Austin at their 15-acre hobby farm in Pennsylvania. Taylor remembers her early childhood as running free with tangled hair, riding horses. There were no close neighbours so theirs was a pretty self-contained family unit, with Andrea's opera-singer mother providing the thrill of showiness. It was this grandmother who got Taylor hooked on singing and performing, so that she became a regular in children's musical theatre shows and competitions. But when the family moved to a suburban neighbourhood, life changed from idyllic to 'trying to fit in'.\nAged 12, her efforts came crashing down. She thinks her peers found her 'weird\". I suspect that they were jealous of her growing success at local festivals when they had her patronisingly tagged as the tall, thin, pale kid who was no good at sports. One night, soon after she'd sung the national anthem at a professional basketball game, she rang round her friends to see if anyone wanted to hang out with her at the local mall. That memory is one of those painful ones you'll never fully get over,' she says, emotionally. 'At that point I'd been shunned from the group for whatever reason and I was still trying desperately to be included. That evening, I called them up\nand they each said no and Mom said, \"You\nknow what? You want to go to the mall, let's go together.\" And we ran into this entire group of girls who had told me they were busy that night. In situations like that my mum has known exactly the right time to run away. There are situations where you have to encourage someone to be tough and there are times when you should just run. So we got in the car and we drove to the mall that's an hour and a half away but is a better mall.\" She says this with a small deprecatory laugh. 'And we showed them in our own tiny way. We had a great time.' And you wrote a song about it? 'I did.' 'The Best Day' reduced me to tears; Taylor is touched when I mention this-apparently it has the same effect on her own mother.\n'In school, I dealt with a bunch of different kinds of being alone, Taylor continues. There's being alone because no one talks to you. There's feeling alone when you walk up to a table at lunch and you're not welcome to sit down. There's standing on a stage at a local festival with your acoustic guitar that's as big as you and some kid from your grade screams obscenities at you. It's school. It's what everyone goes through at some point. And the only thing that got me through really tough days was writing songs about it. I would sit there on those lonely days and say, \"It's OK, because I can write a song about this later.\" I've carried that mantra with me since: any time I feel pain, rejection, heartbreak, I subliminally say to myself, \"I can write a song about this and then it will feel better.\"\" She remains thin-skinned. She avoids reading blog comments about herself because of the random cruelty of the net. 'It hurt me deeply in school and it hurts me deeply now.' So Kanye West must have really touched a raw nerve: last year, the rapper stormed on to the stage to protest when she won \"Best Female Video' at the MTV Video Music Awards (he was rooting for Beyoncé). Did that feeling of public humiliation take her straight back to school? She shoots me a keen sideways glance and says by way of agreement, \"It's one of those things that impacted me really heavily and emotionally.\"\nShe says when she wrote her first song, aged 12-a kid who loved writing poetry mucking about with three chords on a guitar-she knew instantly, 'This was all I wanted in life. There wasn't going to be a back-up plan.' When I ask her what she wants in the medium-term, she says a stable relationship and to write books or songs, even if she is no longer recording them herself. And she suffers from the true writer's ambivalence and detachment. 'Sometimes in situations where life is happening to me, I'm looking for the metaphor and I'm wondering how to express my feelings in a chorus,' she admits.\nShe was only 14 when Sony/ATV Music Publishing in Nashville signed her as a staff writer. Her parents, who had nightly endured her nagging about moving to the country-music capital, then agreed to relocate, yanking an ever-tolerant Austin out of his school too. For a while Taylor co-wrote in her publishers' offices after school (where her experience was less unhappy this time), then she spent her final year home-schooled\" (in reality studying in the back of cars) while she completed a radio tour. In 2006, her eponymous debut album was released on the independent label Big Machine Records, whose founder Scott Borchetta was prepared to take a risk on her. It went quadruple platinum.\nThe follow-up album, Fearless, was even more successful. As a teetotal girl who shuns scandal she was condescendingly dubbed the 'anti-Britney'. Speak Now is pitched at an older listener, but she is not about to lead her younger fans astray. During our photo shoot, as she reclined in a gothic dress slit to the thigh, her PR Paula whispered, 'Too much leg!' and Taylor immediately pulled the skirt closed.\nBut she's more than just a transient teeny phenomenon. She is an alchemical combination. As well as the pleasing voice, the nice image, the songwriting brilliance, she is also an astonishingly intuitive businesswoman. She has created a Taylor Nation (an affiliation of fans' websites) and her website encourages them to 'pre-sell' her new album online, with the promise of a meeting with their idol-princess for the most successful. It's marketing that's finely tuned to the youthful enthusiasms of the core of her fanbase. She has a management team of four, including her mother, who convene weekly to discuss the way ahead, but Taylor has the final say and many of the ideas are hers. 'I don't know if I would feel right handing decisions to other people and living with the consequences. Taking responsibility for your career is important if you want it to go in the direction you have in your mind,\" she says. There are Taylor backpacks, dolls, T-shirts, greetings cards. Her schedule to launch Speak Now involves crisscrossing the Atlantic and features all the big-hitting US television shows including Today and the Late Show with David Letterman.\nShe feels she can only offer a boyfriend 'what's left over', after giving 'heart and soul on stage every night'. She admits she has only had three real relationships. She dated Jonas in 2008 and the breakup inspired her hit 'Forever and Always', to which he retorted with a song called 'Paranoid', like an adolescent revenge battle conducted through iTunes. A year later, she teamed up with Taylor Lautner on screen and off when she made Valentine's Day, a brief and not entirely successful foray into acting. Rumour has it that the track Back to December' on the new album is a song of apology for dumping him. She says to me, In relationships, you leam lessons in how to treat people, and sometimes you leam them too late. If you're me, you go over in your head a million times what you would have done differently. This is a song expressing regret. Sometimes every voice in your head is screaming, \"You need to apologise. This was not handled well. You hurt somebody.\"\" So has the subject heard the song yet? 'No.' So you don't know how he'll react? 'I don't,' she says in a small voice.\nShe senses my amusement that so many tracks have been written about so few Romecs. Just three relationships? (The third was with an anonymous schoolboy.) 'I wasn't factoring in the almost-relationships, and they're almost more inspiring, she adds, wryly self-knowing. 'Almost-relationships are very important to the writing process.' This switch from girl to adult is an endearing trait: 'I love not really knowing if I'm a grown-up,' she says winningly.\nWe carry on with the song-inspiration game by talking about the title track on Speak Now. 'One of my friends was talking about how her ex was marrying another girl and how she was heartbroken over it. I said, \"Are you going to speak now?\" You know, speak now or for ever hold your peace; burst into the church. I then went home and had this terrible dream about an ex-boyfriend getting married and I woke up and immediately wrote my game plan should it become reality.' She is laughing. I do not think Jonas or Lautner need to worry that she is truly going to interrupt a future wedding service. So is she single? 'Yes. I'm not a mopy single girl. I wake up in the moming and think, \"What do I need to do today?\" and at no point do I think, \"I need to find a boyfriend.\"\" It's a nicely acerbic comment and one prickling with the tension between naivety and independence.\nActually, the very mechanism behind her writing is a struggle towards maturity. She says. 'For me, writing songs is a way of justifying things that happen in my life and making it seem as if they happened for a reason-if only to teach me something. If I can write a song then it almost becomes this golden-framed memory. It not only helps me understand why we feel pain, it makes me celebrate it afterwards.'\nShe says she would not be so driven if she hadn't felt the need to scream 'I'll show you all!' at the six girls who decided to reject her. 'There are two ways you can go with it. You can let it destroy you...or you can use it as fuel to drive you: to dream bigger, work harder. I wasn't invited to parties and I look back now and I'm so thankful that I was at home, playing the guitar until my fingers bled.\"\nWhat about the girls involved? Have they ever been in touch? She nods. 'I don't think they even remember what happened. And when I see them sitting in line at my meet-and-greets wearing my T-shirts, I'm not going to walk up to them and say, \"How could you do that?\" Because look at how life has gone. They were there for a reason, and I'm happy about it'.\nTaylor's new album Speak Now is out now on Mercury Records",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift's Playlist\nBy Scott Frampton\nO, The Oprah Magazine  |  November 18, 2010\n\nThe country-pop ingenue values a perfectly turned lyric—even if it's in Icelandic.\n\n\nAt 21, Taylor Swift has four Grammys, two platinum records, a new apartment (her first) in Nashville, and a tuneful knack for getting things off her chest, to judge from her new album, Speak Now. \"The record is like a collection of open letters, telling people what I wish I'd said when the moment was right there in front of me,\" she says. Its expressive powers also make music the perfect gift, according to Swift. \"When I want to give something that people will really appreciate, I put together a playlist that caters to whatever situation they're in. It's comforting to know there's always a song out there that says what you feel.\" Here, Swift shares a few of her eloquent favorites.\n\nFor mending a bruised heart \"I've created a lot of breakup playlists for friends. One of my standbys is 'You Wanted It,' by MoZella. I first heard it in an airport bathroom when I was going through a situation with a guy—I'd thought he was in, but he was just chasing me for the sake of the chase. This song sounds like she can empathize.\"\n\nFor making yourself at home \"I'm a big fan of 'A Little Opera Goes a Long Way,' by Sky Sailing: [sings] Pretend you're not alone / Like you are center stage on Broadway / 'Cause when you are on your own / A little opera goes a long way. That was my theme song for the first few days of living solo.\"\n\nFor feeling creative \"My 18-year-old brother turned me on to the Icelandic band Sigur Rós—they make me happy and take me away to dreamland. I love trying to memorize the words, even though they're singing in their own language. Sometimes I'll make up some lyrics. It gets pretty interesting.\"\n\nFor pondering a certain four-letter word \"I have a playlist called Happily Ever that's 30 songs deep, all about love: 'Until You,' by Dave Barnes, 'Rain,' by Patty Griffin, 'Easy Silence,' by the Dixie Chicks. When I listen to 'Naked as We Came,' by Iron and Wine, I hang on every word and dissect every metaphor; I'm completely absorbed.\"\n",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: Entertainer of the Year\nFrom an Album of the Year Grammy to the megahit 'Speak Now,' our Entertainer of the Year earned a career's worth of commercial and critical success -- in just 12 short months.\n\nBy Dave Karger\nPublished on December 3, 2010 05:00AM EST\n\nYou know you’re a pop culture force when you straighten your hair and it makes national headlines. ”I thought it was so amusing,” marvels Taylor Swift about the attention placed on her surprisingly non-wavy tresses at Nov. 21’s American Music Awards. ”Nobody knew it was me. I saw Katy Perry when she was in the middle of an interview. She looked over, obviously didn’t realize it was me, and then looked away. Like, that’s one of my friends!”\n\n2010 will go down in history as the year we all saw Taylor Swift differently. The 20-year-old kicked things off with a No. 2 single debut (”Today Was a Fairytale”), a hit movie (Valentine’s Day), and four Grammy wins, including Album of the Year for her 2008 CD, Fearless. She spent months headlining arena concerts and big-ticket awards shows. But there was one achievement — the Oct. 25 release of her third record, Speak Now — that topped everything. Buoyed by strong reviews and the radio-friendly hit ”Mine,” Speak amassed a jaw-dropping 1,047,000 units in first-week sales, the highest tally for any release in five years. For all that, the confidently sweet woman who was only 2 months old when Entertainment Weekly launched in 1990 is now our youngest-ever Entertainer of the Year.\n\nMost impressively, Swift single-handedly wrote all 14 songs on Speak Now — which makes sense considering how astonishingly personal each track is. Though she hasn’t confirmed the identities of any of her subjects, she’s widely believed to be singing about exes Taylor Lautner (”Back to December”), Joe Jonas (”Last Kiss”), and John Mayer (”Dear John”), as well as her MTV VMA spotlight thief Kanye West (”Innocent”), actress and romantic rival Camilla Belle (”Better Than Revenge”), and influential music blogger Bob Lefsetz (”Mean”). Over a late breakfast in Beverly Hills, Swift talked with EW about her record-setting sales and controversial lyrics — and even said a few words about Kanye West and her new boyfriend, Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nEW: Before Speak Now was released, were you nervous about it selling?\nTAYLOR SWIFT: It was an emotional roller coaster leading up to releasing that record. I tend to live somewhere between hope and fear. I’ve never wavered so much in my life than I did in the weeks leading up to the record release.\n\nEW: As the first week went by, were you getting updates on how it was doing?\nSWIFT: I wasn’t given any sales updates. That was by choice. I didn’t think that we could sell a million records, to be completely honest with you. I felt like, ”There’s no way I can do this, and the fact that people are speculating whether I can or not immediately gives everyone a reason to say ‘It did less than projected’ if I sold 999,999 records.” But everybody else seemed to think that we could do this impossible thing.\n\nEW: So how did you find out about the number?\nSWIFT: I got a call, and it was a bunch of people from management and my mom and my dad on the phone. I remember Scott Borchetta, my record-label president, saying, ”Congratulations. I guess you’re my million-dollar baby.” I made him say it, like, four times because I couldn’t actually believe it. First I was screaming, and then I was really silent, and then I was really emotional, and then I was dancing. I still can’t wrap my mind around it.\n\nEW: And now people are saying you’ve saved the music business.\nSWIFT: I write music about my life and love and relationships, and I hope that people like it enough to bring it into their world and make it about their life and their love and their relationships. That’s where I have to draw the line as far as what I am and what I am not.\n\nEW: Which song on the record were you most scared to write?\nSWIFT: I never had that feeling. There were, of course, songs on the record — and I think you can probably use your imagination about the ones I’m talking about — where I knew people would draw their own conclusions about who they were about. I would take a few seconds and think, ”Okay, you need to really have an idea of what you’re doing here and what the consequences could be.”\n\nBecause I realize there are consequences to your actions. But the reason I write songs is to help clarify how I feel and get past it. Writing a song like ”Mean” helped me. The songs on the record that are really raw — those songs helped me more than anything.\n\nEW: Were you surprised by how quickly and specifically people started speculating about the subjects of the songs?\nSWIFT: I imagined that people would make their own guesses. Sometimes I would laugh because I would see it in print and it would say, ”This song, which is written about her ex, so-and-so…” And they would write about it as if it was fact. The fact is, I haven’t ever confirmed that any song is about any particular person. There’s something kind of freeing about that. As far as I’m concerned, it’s all still up in the air.\n\nEW: When you wrote ”Innocent,” did you know immediately that you would sing it on the VMAs, where Kanye West had caused that ruckus last year?\nSWIFT: I didn’t know that until about a week out. That woke me up in the middle of the night. Before I had gone to sleep I had decided that I didn’t want to perform on the show. Or even go. Then I woke up in the middle of the night and I realized that I had to, and that I wanted to perform that song.\n\nEW: You’re partially responsible for this because you wrote the song, but how do you feel about the fact that you and Kanye West continue to be linked?\nSWIFT: It’s such a long story and it’s such an old story. I wasn’t given much choice in the matter, but the one choice that I do have, that I continue to make, is to not talk about it.\n\nEW: Have you heard his new record?\nSWIFT: I don’t want to talk about him.\n\nEW: You caught some flak this year for some of your performances, particularly your duet with Stevie Nicks at the Grammys. Did that bother you?\nSWIFT: Words are everything to me. Words can build me up and make me feel so good. And on the flip side, words can absolutely demolish me. I am nowhere close to being bulletproof when it comes to criticism. Feeling everything is part of being a songwriter. If I block out those feelings of pain and rejection, then I don’t know what I would write about. I’d rather feel pain when I read something terrible about me than feel nothing.\n\nEW: Were there any performances where you thought later, ”That wasn’t my finest moment”?\nSWIFT: Yeah, of course. I constantly try to get better as a performer and a vocalist. My mom tells me that when I was a little kid she never had to punish me for something I did wrong because I’d punish myself worse than she ever could. That’s how I am when I make a mistake.\n\nEW: Okay, moving on: Have you seen any good movies lately?\nSWIFT: Um, yes! [Laughs] What have I seen lately? None that are out yet.\n\nEW: How about Love & Other Drugs, starring Jake Gyllenhaal?\nSWIFT: [Smiles] It’s a good movie.\n\nEW: So what’s it like to go away for a weekend with someone and have it end up on the cover of a magazine?\nSWIFT: I write in great detail about my personal life, but I don’t talk about it.\n\nEW: Is anyone in your life allowed to say, ”You can’t write a song about me”?\nSWIFT: Nothing is off-limits as far as writing. You can’t have parts of your life you don’t write about.\n\nEW: You’ve had at least one song written about you…\nSWIFT: Like what?\n\nEW: Doesn’t the Jonas Brothers song ”Much Better” have a line about ”teardrops on her guitar”?\nSWIFT: Mmm! [Sarcastically] I mean, that could be about anybody.\n\nEW: If one of your friends says, ”I just heard this new song that’s definitely about you,” would you listen to it?\nSWIFT: Of course!\n\nEW: But you always say that you like to have the last word. So what’s going to happen then?\nSWIFT: Then my fourth album is going to happen!",

Swift presided over a “spirited” dirty Santa gift exchange, providing all the holiday-inspired gifts for the guests, “It was fun watching everyone open their gifts,” the friend says. “Taylor loves that game.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Google Translation] LOVETALK MEETS TAYLOR\nTaylor Swift (21) is a tough chick who is not afraid to approach nice guys. After relationships with Taylor Lautner and Joe Jonas, she is now often spotted with Jake Gyllenhaal, but Taylor is saying nothing about it for the time being. She does talk a lot about one of her favorite topics: loooove!\n-The boys lie in rows at your feet. Has it always been that way?\n-'Not actually, no. I really didn't have much success in love in the past. It was so bad that out of insecurity I paired the boys I liked with my girlfriends. I managed to arrange dates for everyone except myself. The advantage of this was that I became friends with all the boys at school, but on the other hand, that was of course not really fun. Sometimes I fell in love with a boy who mainly saw me as a BFF and then fell in love with someone else. Then I could cry...\"\n-You must have been very popular at school with all that matching work!\n-'No. it was not! The girls at my school were a bit bitchy and they were very jealous because I was so good with the boys. They also bullied me because of my... glasses with thick lenses. I have pretty bad eyesight and was regularly called 'Jampot'. Actually, I didn't really fit in anywhere, because I was very different from all my classmates. I was pretty quiet in class and kept busy writing lyrics. I didn't really care what they thought of me. Somehow I was just sure that I would eventually go further than everyone else.\n-Which type of guys do you actually like?\n-'I don't have one specific type, but I mainly like guys who have a passion. I find someone who loves his job or is completely absorbed in a certain hobby very attractive. I used to think it was especially cool if a boy had a nice car, wore cool clothes and all that. looked good. Now none of that matters to me anymore. I am especially looking for a boy with a strong character, whom I can trust completely.\"\n-But your famous ex-boyfriends aren't exactly ugly, right? \n-'Um… that's true. But I find someone Not really ugly anyway. And of course it's no problem if my future boyfriend is the biggest hunk in town. I just want to point out that the appearance is not the first thing I fall for. On the other hand, Chace Crawford is a guy I won't say no to! In short, like everyone else, appearance is partly decisive for me, but in a bad way I lose character very quickly. And besides, in the end, handsome boys just become old grandpas with dentures.\"\n\n-Are famous boys an advantage or a turn-off for you? \n-That in itself doesn't really matter to me. It usually clicks more quickly with someone who is also in the world. For other boys, my fame is often clearly something puts them off a bit. It makes me very uncomfortable when they find out who I am and then start praising me. Boys who are also in the spotlight will understand that faster. I'd rather be treated like an ordinary girl than a superstar.\n\n-What kind of guys can't stand you?\n-'I am very sensitive and I talk a lot. What I really hate are guys who have nothing to say and just say \"yes\" or \"hmm\" to everything. Those closed types who don't talk about anything are of no use to you. And what I also find a turn-off are guys who drink a lot and want to go out every weekend. I'm a bit of a homebody and I like it if the other person can be the same every now and then.'\n\n-Do you dare to tell your friends if you don't like their new lover?\n'Absolutely! Isn't that why you're friends? When you are in love, you often look through rose-colored glasses. Then some properties are not noticeable. My friends are everything to me. If done right, they will last longer than any crush.\"\n\n-As a former queen of couples, do you have any good tips for seducing someone?\n-'Just because I'm a good matchmaker doesn't mean I'll make anything of it, right? Last year all my relationships failed. When it comes to love, I have no idea how to go about it. That is different in every situation, so I would actually advise: just go with your feeling. Last time I jumped straight into the deep end. That was great and very exciting, but in the end it also hurt me a lot. The time before I worked carefully and exploratively and it didn't yield anything for me. That also hurts quite a lot, I can tell you.'\n\n-What do you think is the best cure for a broken heart?\n-'You just have to do a lot of things that make you very happy. I am also very optimistic. A sad day. being is fine, but inside I know that the sun will shine again. For the rest I write everything down. That's why so many of my songs are about broken loves.'\n\n-Do you regret some things that have happened to you in the area of ​​love?\n-'No, I wouldn't have missed all my adventures for anything.

Last May, just days after historic flooding in and around Nashville, Taylor donated $500,000 to various flood relief causes. \"Wanting to give to other people, it makes people happy and it should make you happy to give back, and it cer-tainly felt like the right thing to do,\" she says, as if she hadn't done anything more than given a friend a lift when their car had broken down. \n\"I've made a lot of decisions in life based on gut feelings and that's how I handle charity, that's how I approach it all,\" she explains. \"There's not a committee that decides on who I give to, it's just what I feel is the right thing to do.\" \nIt's also why she's stepped up to the plate for the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, Donate MyDress.org, MusiCares and the Wish Upon a Hero Foundation, among many other organizations. It's also why when Hendersonville High School, the school she attended for two years before being home-schooled, needed a new sound and lighting system for its gym, Taylor donated the $75,000 necessary. And why, when she turned 18 and her label gave her a bubble-gum pink pickup truck, she gave it to Victory Junction Gang Camp, a facility founded by NASCAR driver Kyle Petty and his wife, Pattie, to honor their late son, Adam. \nEven when Taylor launched her new album, Speak Now, in October, there was a charitable aspect.

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Speak Now\nInside Track | Secrets Of The Mix Engineers\nMix Secrets Mixing / Production\nBy Paul Tingen Published February 2011\n\nTaylor Swift has become country music's biggest mainstream star, thanks in part to a stellar production team. Producer Nathan Chapman and mixer Justin Niebank lift the lid on Swift's latest hit album, Speak Now.\n\nIn early 2006, Taylor Swift was an unknown 16‑year old with a good voice and a talent for writing songs. Her rise to the top since then has been, well, swift. Her eponymously titled debut album was released in October that year, and became a monster hit in the country market. Follow‑up Fearless, released in November 2008, has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide, propelled her to the top of mainstream charts around the world, and spawned hit singles like 'Love Story' and 'You Belong With Me'. It made her, at age 20, the youngest person ever to receive the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\n\nThe huge pressure that must have resulted from all this appears to have rolled off her like water off a duck's back, for her third album, Speak Now, released in October 2010, appears to be on its way to become as successful as its predecessor. It sold more than one million copies in the first week after its release, and has already generated one major hit single, 'Mine'. At the time of writing, the second single from the album, 'Back To December', was near the top of the US charts.\n\nChemistry\nWhen she was first signed, Swift's record company Big Machine sent her into the studio with some big‑name producers. This, however, resulted in a serious case of 'demoitis', Swift believing that her original demos had a better feeling than the newly recorded tracks. The record company must have felt that she had a point, for the complete unknown responsible for these demos was duly invited to produce three album tracks. By the time he was done, he was tasked with producing the whole album (minus one song), leading directly to the above‑described results.\n\nThe unknown in question is Nathan Chapman, and four years on he's regarded as one of the biggest hitters in Nashville. Having not only produced Swift's Fearless and Speak Now and won two of Fearless' four Grammy Awards, he has also produced The Band Perry, Jewel and Jimmy Wayne, and has had one of his songs recorded by Martina McBride. At the relatively young age of 33, he already has an astonishing three decades of music industry experience behind him, the reason being that his parents are Christian singers and recording artists, and as a result he's been in and out of studios and on the road from a young age. His web site shows him as a 10‑year‑old at a mixing desk with a track sheet, looking very serious. On the phone from his studio in Nashville, Chapman comments: \"As a child, I was fascinated by the recording process, and by the time I was 14 my Dad would play me songs he'd written, and I would tell him that I knew exactly what the whole band was supposed to do. He was like: 'Oh, you're a producer.' I would say, however, that my first thing is to be a guitar player.”\n\nChapman appears to have slightly overdosed on music and the recording process at one stage, because in the late '90s he escaped to Lee University in Tennessee to do a degree in English. Meeting his wife Stephanie, a singer‑songwriter, in 2000, put him back on the music trail, and for a number of years he produced demos for her and others in his own modest, Nuendo‑driven facility located \"in a shack behind a publishing company in Nashville”. In 2005, a fellow songwriter called Liz Rose was impressed enough with the demos the Chapman couple had created to ask Nathan Chapman whether he was up for doing some demos for a promising young singer‑songwriter she was writing with, one Taylor Swift.\n\n\"Taylor and I made the demos for the first album at my then studio,” elaborated Chapman, \"with me playing all the instruments. When I was given the job of actually producing three songs, and then almost the whole of the record, we took these demos into a few professional studios and tracked them there with a small band. For the next album, Fearless, we went into a professional studio without me having heard the songs before. Taylor played me her songs right there and then, while the band was waiting, and I charted them and we cut the tracks live in the studio, with me playing guitar, plus a bassist and a drummer, and Taylor singing live. We added the other instruments as overdubs.\n\n\"With Speak Now, we deliberately went back to our initial way of working together. We had an unlimited budget, and could have gone and recorded the whole album in the Bahamas, used any studio we liked and whatever musicians we wanted. But we decided to bring it back to the basics on purpose, because we wanted to keep it about the music and our chemistry. The second album was easier because we were coming off the momentum of the first album, and we simply continued the artistic track that we were on. It sold like crazy and won all these Grammy Awards and we're very proud of it. After all that, we wanted to keep ourselves out of a place of failure, and not try to over-compensate for the pressure we were feeling for a follow up to Fearless. That's why we stripped it down and made the demos first. Taylor came to my studio and I played all the instruments on the demos, and because I have a good vocal booth, her demo vocals ended up being the vocals you hear on the record. After finishing the demos, we went out to different studios, and tried different combinations of engineers and musicians to replace some of the elements of my demos, mostly the programmed drums, and to do additional overdubs.”\n\nChapman and Swift's working method comes across as a straightforward and sensible strategy for avoiding performance anxiety and corresponding creative obstacles, and it clearly paid off. In the process Swift stepped up a gear, for while she co‑wrote a substantial number of the songs on her first and second albums, mostly with Liz Rose, she wrote all the songs for Speak Now by herself, displaying a remarkable degree of self‑confidence for someone so young. Chapman's contribution is equally impressive, given that he says that he's responsible for playing \"probably 60 percent of the music on the album, including 90 percent of the guitars.” He also turns out to be a very quick engineer and arranger, playing, arranging, and recording the demos for each song in just a few hours at his Pain In The Art Studio in Nashville. The demo for 'Mine' apparently took less than five hours to record, and sounded, according to Chapman, \"almost identical to the record. After that we worked on the track for another four months, off and on, and spent $30,000 to make sure it sounded perfect in the real world.”\n\nSo how on earth does he manage to create record‑quality demos in just a few hours? And why then spend another $30,000 perfecting them? The whole process began, apparently, with a particularly liberal approach to coaching Swift in songwriting. \"Taylor is a great songwriter, and there's not much I have to do on that front. I'm not afraid to be OK with that. Some producers may be uncomfortable with not giving an opinion, they don't want to appear useless. I'm not like that. I want to capture her gut instinct of her playing her songs on her guitar, because nine out of 10 times that's the right way to go. It's exciting when she sings a song with her guitar. And because the environment at my studio is pretty laid‑back, I usually get that. If we do make changes in the songs, like cut an instrumental section that appears two times, or rearrange things in other ways, it usually happens later on.\n\n\"When I work with Taylor at my studio, it's just she and I. I do the engineering myself. It's not hard to do. I work in Logic or Pro Tools and have a Digidesign C24 control surface, and I use Focal Solo 6 monitors, which are my favourites, and [Yamaha] NS10s, and a couple of racks of outboard. I have all my different recording chains plugged in and ready to go. I don't ever have to reach up and turn a knob. It's a bit like Chris Lord‑Alge, who doesn't turn the knobs on his compressors but just moves patches [to use a different compressor instead]. I have three or four microphones that I swing into place when I need them and swing back when I don't.\n\n Because I've worked this way for so long, playing all the instruments in demos and recording everything myself, I don't really know how to work any other way. Pressing buttons keeps me focused on the project, and as soon as I step out of my studio, I'm worthless!” he laughs.\n\n\"So Taylor comes in, and plays me a song, and I chart it while listening to her. I then tap out a tempo, she hands me her guitar, I go into a recording booth, put on headphones, start the click‑track and hit record. She's hearing what I'm doing and singing along while she's in the control room, so I know where I am in the song. After that, I program the drums, usually using [Toontrack's] Superior Drummer in Logic. I play the drum parts on my Roland Fantom G6 keyboard, and then quantise. I then play the fills that I want to complete the drum part. After this I'll put down a bass part, and at this point we make sure we're really OK with the tempo and that we love the arrangement. I may add an electric guitar to make the track bigger, and then she'll go into the vocal booth and she'll sing the song three or four times. We may do a little bit of comping, but she executes these songs really well, and I don't want to mess with her takes too much. The audience wants to hear someone sing with real emotion. From there we'll listen to what we have and we'll maybe add some vocal harmonies and guitars, and I do a quick mix and she's out of the door.”\n\nBoring Bits\nChapman stresses that Swift's co‑production credit is \"not a vanity credit. We were really a team, very collaborative. There are parts of making a record that are boring, and she was there the whole summer, including all the boring bits. She'd have opinions on drum sounds, and everything that we did. She also played some acoustic guitar, like the intro part of the song 'Speak Now' and in a few other songs. The song 'Never Grow Up' is just she singing and I on acoustic guitar. We recorded ourselves live. That song probably happened in two hours.”\n\nWith regard to his signal chains, Chapman says \"I recorded Taylor's voice with an Avantone CV12, which I also used on Fearless, going into a Martech MSS10 mic pre, and then a Tube‑Tech CL1B compressor. For acoustic guitar I use a Neumann KM54, going into an API 512 preamp, going into a [Empirical Labs] Distressor. I recorded my own harmony vocals with a Shure SM57, also going via the API and Distressor. I use the same mic and signal chain for recording electric guitars, though I have to say that I only used real amps for about 40 percent of my parts on the album. For the other 60 percent I used the Logic 9 Amp Designer. I've used plug‑in amps for a while, like the [IK] Amplitude and Digidesign [now Avid]'s Eleven, and I particularly love the sound of Amp Designer. For bass I used an Avalon VT737 direct signal path preamp. There are three or four tracks on which my demo bass survived, 'Dear John' being one of them. For going in and out of my DAW, I used the Apogee AD16X and the DA16X, although I just got the Symphony I/O, which sounds great. I also have the Cranesong Avocet monitor system.”\n\nChapman uses the Endless Audio CLASP System in his studio. Described in some circles as \"the biggest breakthrough in recording technology in years”, it provides a seamless way of using a large‑format multitrack tape machine as a front end when tracking to a computer‑based DAW. Chapman: \"All lead vocals and electric and acoustic guitars were cut to my 1979 MCI JH24 tape recorder, and then synchronised with Logic or Pro Tools using my CLASP system. The CLASP system allows you to record and play back from tape and your DAW all in one movement, without any latency whatsoever, which is great for performing. If you listen to 'Mine', you'll hear some tape hiss in the intro vocal. I like that; it's fun.”\n\nArtistic Vibe\nDespite Chapman's obvious enthusiasm for the CLASP system, he emphasises that he's not an analogue freak, and in general plays down the importance of his gear, despite endorsement deals with Logic, Avantone, Apogee and PRS guitars. \"I'm not much of an engineer,” Chapman says. \"I simply use whatever is in front of me. I don't know, for example, whether the Martech or the other stuff I have is the best. I simply have it in the house and I plug it in. I also would not describe myself as an analogue guy at heart; I don't use tape on 90 percent of the projects I do, but when I do need it, the MCI is great. Part of the reason for using it on the new Taylor album was because many of the songs have a retro vibe to them, so I was trying to honour that. If you want the sound of tape saturation, you need to use tape. Using tape is a creative tool, I enjoy using it as much for sonic reasons as for the artistic vibe: it's cool to have the energy of a tape machine running in the room while working!”\n\nWith regards to his dual Logic/Pro Tools setup, Chapman explains that \"I probably work 50/50 with them. Logic is a programmer's dream, and Pro Tools doesn't handle virtual instruments well. Here's how I look at it: Logic is for creative people like composers and songwriters, Pro Tools is for engineers. Logic has everything right there for programming, and I'll use it when I want to create loops and keyboard parts and am throwing out ideas. But if I'm wearing my engineering hat, recording audio and trying to get the right sounds and so on, I'll use Pro Tools. But I love Logic. If I'm working on Pro Tools I may bring things back into Logic if I want to create loops and keyboard parts. The keyboard stuff I record on my demos is usually done in Logic, using Logic soft synths, though some of the stuff is done with the Roland Fantom. 'Mine' was recorded in Pro Tools, because it was very much a guitar song, but most demos for Speak Now were done in Logic. I do the rough mix in the box, in whatever platform I started the song in, using plug‑ins from Digidesign, Waves and Sound Toys. Pretty normal stuff.\n\n\"A pop artist would probably release what we'd done after five hours, but country artists don't want to hear programmed drums, they don't want to hear fake stuff. So once we had recorded the demos, we would book whatever studio we wanted for each song, to replace the drums, in many cases the bass, and to add whatever overdubs we envisioned, like fiddle, keyboards, percussion and strings. After we got the demos right, we opened it up and allowed ourselves to spend money and cut a big record. You can really blow it at that stage if you have too much time and too much money, but we were very intentional and very disciplined about that, and I think it paid off. The main decisions were made in the demos, but many small details still needed filling in.\n\n\"With regard to the drums, the parts we wanted the drummers to play were dictated by the demo. I wanted live drums purely for the sound and the energy. It was more about the performance and the engineering than figuring out what to play. I was pretty much like a classic version of the arranger. So we'd pick a studio, and an engineer, and a drummer, and we'd go and cut the drums on several songs at a time. I did that process with engineers like Chuck Ainlay, Justin Niebank, Chad Carlson and Steve Marcantonio. Steve cut the drums on 'Mine' at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, with Shannon Forrest playing drums. We tried several bassists until we had a bass part that worked, which was played by Amos Heller, of Taylor's live band. In Nashville, it's rare for a road musician to be on the record, but he earned his way into this record by kicking ass. In fact, all Taylor's road musicians played some parts on the album, which was important for me and her.”\n\nGreat Balance\nThree‑time Grammy‑winning Justin Niebank is one of America's highest‑profile mixers, engineers and producers. He engineered the drums on a few tracks on Speak Now, and mixed the entire album, having also mixed the whole of Fearless. \"I'm OK with mixing,” elaborates Chapman, \"but I'm more of an emotional mixer. My mixes feel good to me, but I know that Justin's mixes will sound good everywhere. Like me, he has that feel‑good side, and he reads my mind and hears tracks the way I hear them. But we don't only think alike from an artistic point of view, he's also a great technician, who is amazing with balance and tone and making sure that all the frequencies are in the right place.”\n\nSpeak Now was mixed in Niebank's room at Blackbird Studios, in Pro Tools. \"He mixed Fearless on his desk,” explains Chapman, \"but for Speak Now we had to mix 17 songs in three weeks, and I knew that I would want to go back to tweak some of the songs we had mixed earlier, and I did not want to have to recall the mixing board every time. There just wasn't time for that. But we did use the Dangerous 2‑Bus because we wanted analogue summing.”\n\n\"We A/B'd the Dangerous,” Niebank continues, \"and it's one of these things where you can sit in front of a pair of studio monitors and say, 'OK, it sounds wider and brighter and has more depth,' and that's fine. But does the average person listen to music like that? No, they listen to something that communicates with their hearts, and that, ultimately, is what mixing is about. We felt that sending the mix through the Dangerous sounded good, and it was maybe taking a little bit of the load off the computer. It also allowed me to use my API compressor and the Nightpro EQ3D over the two‑mix, so that pleased me. And I mixed to half‑inch, which is like putting a filter on a camera. It's processing, and basically a sound. I always immediately transfer the half‑inch mix to hi‑res DSD digital, to retain the transients as much as possible.”\n\nMoving on to describing his actual mixing approach, Niebank explains \"The challenge of any modern mix is the amount of tracks that you work with, which is very different from the days when you could only fit 23 tracks on a tape. Nowadays you have tons of things and you have to try to figure out how to fit them all together. The most important thing in this respect is to get into the mindset of the people who created it, you have to rewind to their moment of inspiration when they created the song, and see if you bring out the original spirit of their creation. For this reason I love getting a rough mix. There are times when people don't want me to hear the rough mix, and say, 'Go with your gut.' That's fine, but as a mixer I prefer to be part of the whole chain of events. One listen is worth more than a thousand words, and it's nice to hear where they left off. Sometimes people have a great rough, and it's tough to beat it. I like that challenge.\n\n\"I prefer it when people send me a Pro Tools file with consolidated files that are cleaned up and together. That doesn't happen all the time. I get a lot of stuff that requires my assistant to spend time going through it and cleaning things up and doing crossfades and things. Sometimes people simply send me the file as it was immediately after their last overdub, and if there's too much to suss out, I'll send it back to them. I'm an intuitive person, and if I have to choose the right vocal take, I'm not doing my job. You have to give me what you're passionate about, and then I can react to that and take it to the next level.\n\n\"I don't have a set procedure for mixing. After listening to the rough mix, I'll throw the faders up and I'll listen to everything and start getting a feeling and a handle on the music. If the rhythm is crucial and the song needs power, I'll start with the drums and then the bass. With other songs I'll start with the vocals and acoustic guitars. Sometimes I won't put the bass in until the very end. I work pretty fast. I'll get the lead vocal up and I'll slap stuff in. I don't get precious about individual sounds at first, unless I hear something that requires real surgery. I work with people who know how to record, and my job is less about getting every little thing to sound right as it is about getting a great balance. A great balance will often kind of mix itself. I don't like to over‑tweak or geek. To me that doesn't necessarily make things better, but rather tends to make things sound more processed. I'm also not afraid to pull all the faders back down again if it doesn't work. That's too great a hurdle for many engineers: but if necessary, don't get precious, and start over. I can do five different mixes in 15 minutes, just trying to find a balance that communicates the song!”\n\nSelf‑explanatory\nJustin Niebank: \"Because Nathan is such a good arranger and plays and arranges to the spirit of the vocals, his demos are more self‑explanatory than some other records that I work on. Interestingly enough, I'd done some kind of pre‑mix of 'Mine' for a video thing, with the original drums and bass, and Nathan and Taylor were like: 'This is cool, but we want to go a little bit more for a power approach.' So by the time it got to the final mix they had rerecorded the bass and the drums and it sounded great. Because they really wanted power on 'Mine', I started with the rhythm section and after that brought in the lead vocal. I then fitted the other elements in.\n\n\"The two main challenges in this mix were that Nathan had overdubbed a lot of cool guitar parts, and I wanted to make sure that a high level of honesty was retained. Taylor had thrown on lots of background vocal parts [the screenshots show 31 backing vocal tracks], and it was fun for me to explore these and put each in their own sonic space and still have a degree of innocence and believability, so it didn't sound over-produced. Once again, it's all about the lead vocal communicating with people, and if it sounds too slick, the sense of honesty may be diminished.\n\n\"Fearless was a live‑band‑in‑the‑studio situation, so there was an inherent organic nature that I tried to retain in the mixes. The new record was much more ambitious in terms of arrangements and sounds, yet I still wanted to retain the sense of intimacy. Taylor's records are all about the straight communication wire she has to her audiences, and so I wanted to maintain that, while not diminishing the power of what Nathan and she had done musically, which included some very cool stuff.\n\n\"Nathan told you that many of Taylor's songs on this album had a retro quality? Yeah, that fits. Like Nathan, I prefer the warmer, more intimate records, with space in them — records that really communicate and that are not just a technical exercise. To me when we talk about a retro or vintage quality, it's not just about the sound, but also about performances from the days when things couldn't be edited or overdubbed to death. Vintage is about real music, a combination of a certain sound and the fact that people performed more, and things were mixed in a way that brought that out.\n\n\"I didn't use any outboard for this mix. It was all plug‑ins. I often use the Waves SSL plug‑ins as a basic channel strip, and I'm a big fan of the UAD stuff, so there's a fair amount of that in the mix. I also use a lot of delays and reverb plug‑ins, like the [Avid] D‑Verb, Reverb One, UAD 140 and UAD 250, and so on. Reverb can eat a lot of space in a track, but I like the sense of space and colour and emotion that it can bring. I'm not one of these people who go around saying that they hate reverb.\n\n\"I'm a big proponent of mono reverb, and particularly on Taylor's last record I used a lot of that in the middle, and then I'd open up the space around that. When I hear '50s and '60s music, there's something about the vocal occupying the centre of the mix that blows me away. So I'm trying to apply that in every mix that I do. If you listen to the songs on Speak Now, you'll hear varying degrees of mono reverb in the middle. Sometimes there'll be delays outside of that. It's all about trying to create a picture and a mood. Records and the radio used to be about people looking through a telescope, getting a narrow view into another world. Today things have become so wide. But limitations will sometimes bring out things that you can't define in other ways.”\n\nDrums & bass: Waves SSL E‑channel, Avid Smack!, Bomb Factory Fairchild 670.\n\n\"I didn't use many plug‑ins on the drums in 'Mine', mostly just the Waves SSL channel strip, and EQ. I also didn't do too much to the bass, because it had been recorded through a great mic pre, the Universal Audio 2108, which is incredible. You can mess with it and it adds this wonderful killer harmonic. But of course it has been discontinued. The bass had gone through a Distressor after that, so I only added some mild compression from the Waves SSL channel.\n\n\"When working in the box, I still mirror a bit what I do on a large console. For example, I split the vocal out to another track with parallel compression. One of my favourite things in plug‑ins is if they have a mix feature, which allows me to emulate that effect a little faster. I'll also split everything into subgroups: I had a drum subgroup for crushing, which had the Digidesign Smack! plug‑in. Another drum subgroup had the Fairchild 670 plug‑in on it.”\nThe drums were subgrouped and fed to several different compressors, among them the Bomb Factory Fairchild 670 emulation.\n\nVocals & guitars: Waves Renaissance Vox & De‑esser, UAD 1176 & Roland 201, Sound Toys Echo Boy, Bomb Factory 1176, Pro Tools EQ III.\n\n\"One of the things I like about Pro Tools, whether I'm mixing in the box or on the board, is the ability to split vocals off over different tracks, with different treatments on each. I'll have some moderate compression on the main lead vocal track, more often than not the Renaissance Vox, and I'll follow that with the good old Waves De‑esser. This was the case on the pristine lead vocal track on 'Mine'. On subgroups, I'll often use the UAD Precision De‑esser, though not in this case. I will then split the vocal off to another track with more aggressive compression and EQ; in the case of 'Mine', it was the UAD 1176.\nNiebank's approach to mixing vocals involves multing the lead vocal to several tracks and applying parallel processing, here using the UAD 1176 compressor.\nNiebank's approach to mixing vocals involves multing the lead vocal to several tracks and applying parallel processing, here using the UAD 1176 compressor.\n I'll sometimes split off a third channel and have the UAD Fatso on that. On 'Mine' I used the UAD Roland 201. I also added several delays to the lead vocals, and the Sound Toys Echo Boy. I'll create a balance with all these things together. I can't tell you exactly how, it's a feeling thing.\n\n\"The backing vocals on this song were traditional harmony vocals, and I tried to give each their own little sound. I used the Renaissance Vox on most of them, and also the UAD 1176 and the Bomb Factory 1176. Eventually they also went to a subgroup, on which I had the Waves SSL channel. In general I use a lot of EQ — I'm not afraid to use Pro Tools' regular EQ. I'm a big filter fan. That's a big key to what I do, like in the case of 'Mine' making sure there's enough space for all these vocals and guitars. I like UAD's Pultec emulation plug‑in, and recently I've also become a big fan of UAD's Trident A‑range EQ. Or I'll use the [Waves] Renaissance EQ. I'm not picky. I didn't add many effects to the guitars in 'Mine', but did use the SSL channel strip on many of the guitar tracks, plus on a couple of tracks some delay and reverb.\n\n\"The final thing to add, which is interesting, is that normally when I mix in the box I spend quite a bit of time adding plug‑ins that generate harmonic distortion and analogue‑like textures, but when I mixed 'Mine' this didn't come up. Because Nathan had recorded much of the material via the MCI tape recorder, I naturally defaulted to how I used to mix from analogue tape, which meant messing a bit with the top end, and making sure things weren't flabby. I did use Sound Toys' Decapitor plug-in on quite a few tracks on this album, though, which does add harmonic distortion. It's one of my favourite new plug‑ins.”\n\nFinal mix & mastering: API 2500, NTI Nightpro EQ3D.\n\n\"The whole session was in 24/48. As I mentioned before, I mixed to analogue, on an Ampex two‑track machine, and also had the mix on hi‑res Tascam DSD, and put the API compressor and NTI Nightpro EQ3D on the mix. The mastering engineer, Hank Williams, then made his choice between the analogue and digital versions. If a little air and compression is added during mastering, I'm cool with that. I'm not precious about my mix. I want someone else's opinion, and I feel that a strong balance will survive. The only thing I really don't like is the limiting that makes so many of today's records sound abysmal. Luckily I can get away here in Nashville with putting quite a lot of dynamics on my mixes, and they're left in mastering. The interesting thing is that it means that these records sound better on the radio. Everyone wants to compete, but all the limiting that's done makes records sound like shit on the radio. People don't want their faces ripped off by music, they want records to wrap around them. I tell people that that when a record with more dynamics comes on the radio, it'll sound better than anything else, but to convince young people of that is really tough.\n\n\"The recording industry is in crisis, and there are many reasons for that, but one of the contributing factors is technical, and the technical side of the industry needs to take responsibility for the problems we are having. We are not making things any better by crushing records to death and making them sound like sonic wad. The tendency to tune everything also doesn't help. The artistry of great singers is in how they work with pitch and timing. What creates the individual nature of an artist is how he or she approaches pitch in time. Nobody hits a note straight on. Ray Charles never sang dead in tune. It was about where he placed things in time. And we're killing that in music. I have Auto‑Tune and Melodyne, but prefer not to use it, and I didn't use any on the Taylor album. Occasionally, if I hear something that bugs me, I may brush it with a little Auto‑Tune, but more often than not I get vocals that are over‑tuned, and I'll ask for a version that's not tuned. If my gut instinct is that it affects the performance, I'll make that call. We need to get back to performances, and I wanted to be a bridge between the creator of music and the listener, and not making mixing a technical exercise.”\n\nJustin Niebank: Mixing In & Out Of The Box\nJustin Niebank has more than 400 album credits to his name, and counting. The artists he's worked with include Eric Clapton, Etta James, Keith Urban, Willie Nelson, Bon Jovi, and many, many more. Originally a Chicago native and a bass player, Niebank now divides his time between his own studio and his room at Blackbird Studios, which features an SSL 9000 K‑series desk, and ATC and Genelec 1031 monitors. To hear that Niebank mixed Taylor Swift's Speak Now 'in the box' comes a little bit as a surprise, because he has a reputation for a more traditional approach to mixing and recording. When queried, this indeed turns out to be the case, but not so much in his attitude towards gear as in an emphasis on the importance of performance.\n\n\"During the last 10 years my career has become much more about mixing. I've gotten used to certain procedures on a large desk, and I like the physicality of a large desk and the potential for mistakes and the unexpected. I've also been mixing in the box for a long time, since my programming in Cubase and Nuendo days, so it's not foreign to me either. But I have had to work out some ways to still have spontaneous things happen when working in the box. One way of doing that is never to have a template. I never template anything, whether when working in the box or with a desk.\n\n\"I start every mix for every project from scratch, based on what the song and the artist are about. I change everything about my setup before each project, because I get bored otherwise, and I want the song and artist to inspire me in what I'm doing, as opposed to fitting the song into my formula. I do my best to give every artist that I work with, and by now that's a ridiculous amount, a sound of their own. That has been the main hurdle for me in mixing in the box — the technicality of it is not a big deal. I'm pretty comfortable using the mouse and keyboard, and I only occasionally use my little Euphonix controller. But not working with a template has made it hard for me to compete against the big mixers, who all tend to use them. It works for them so I don't fault them for it, but I had to figure out a way of not doing that and still being able to compete with them.\n\n\"But for me, all this talk about digital versus analogue, and in the box or out of the box, is a bit silly, because the source is everything. What matters most are a great song and a great performance. The single most important piece of equipment in a studio is not the analogue tape recorder or the DAW, but the record button of whatever machine is up whenever the artist has a moment of inspiration. If that inspiration is caught on a decent format, it will make a great recording. That's the bottom line.\n\n\"Recording on analogue was OK, but what you put in and what came out were two different things and there was a point at which this drove me crazy. I did not like the sound of early digital, but when I ran into the earliest 16‑bit version of the [IZ] Radar it astounded me, because it sounded great, and it also had some wonderful editing features. There are times I wish I could still work with it. For a long time after that I also used Nuendo, and Cubase, but five or six years ago it became obvious that Pro Tools was the medium of choice for the majority of my clients and so I switched to that. I still use Cubase 5 for some sequencing and programming, though, because it has some wacky VST things that I love. I also use Reason in Pro Tools for programming; whatever sets me off.\n\n\"The sound of digital, including Pro Tools, has become way better, and I can get out of Pro Tools now what I want. An engineer's job is simply to record a performance, and if it's on analogue, I'll deal with it, and if it's on digital, I'll deal with it. As an engineer I have always been wary of engineers who say that they can only work in analogue or this way or that way. The only thing is that you have to adapt your EQ and miking techniques when working with digital. Many engineers used the same techniques with digital as they used with analogue, and then they were wondering why it sounded so bright. I will do whatever it takes to get my job done, and if somebody wants to do it a certain way because the budget requires it or for another reason, then I have to get my chops together to do it that way. If gear gets in the way of music, then it's off track. The most important thing is not to make the recording process more important than the music.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Google Translation] 'Performing is sometimes emotional for me\"\nFANS\n\"It is sometimes quite strange to share my thoughts, which are personal, to an audience. Or er... sing. It is difficult to describe what goes through my mind when everyone sings along en masse. During my previous tour I stood on stage just listening to the audience. I will never forget that moment. Ever since I was a little girl, I wanted to perform. Now that I do, it is sometimes emotional for me. I am extremely grateful to my fans. They make every concert an unforgettable experience.\nFITNESS\n'If I don't exercise, I notice it immediately when I perform. I definitely don't train to stay slim, but only so that I don't stand on stage out of breath. Performing takes a lot more energy than you think. If I take good care of myself, the public will benefit too. Nobody wants to see a panting singer on stage, right? Since I've been doing pilates, I've gotten my band to work with me during our long rehearsal days. This way we stay fit!\"\nCOVERS\n'I love doing covers of songs that no one expects. When I used to go to concerts a lot, I thought that was the best part of the entire evening. It's just cool when something unexpected happens on stage. Whether that's musical or visual.'\nSTAGE FRIGHT\n'I've been performing since I was 10. It was quite scary at first. But everyone who starts singing faces this problem. All you can do is just get on stage and sing. After that, things will get a little better each time. Someone once advised me to pretend that the audience was standing in their underwear. Please don't do that. That definitely doesn't work!\"\nBFF WITH THE BAND\n'Since my first tour I have been super good friends with the members of my band and crew. We're almost a little obsessed with each other. Even when we're not touring, we see each other every week.",

Ironically enough, during that same time period, Liles had written a song titled 'Try to Make It Anyway,' which was based around Swift.\n\n\"Me and Taylor really hit it off and became really close when we were on tour together,\" Liles tells Taste of Country. \"We had a real emotional relationship. We talked on the phone a lot. She was really cool. One day she called me up and was like, 'Hey, I wrote a song about you.' I was like, 'Dude, that’s really funny because I just wrote a song about you last week! She was like, 'Really!' She asked how it went, and I told her about some of the lines. I didn’t tell her too much, but I told her about the main tag of the song. She was like, 'I want to hear it!'\"\n\nBecause of Love and Theft's hectic tour schedule and having to promote their music, Liles never got around to recording the track so he could send it to Swift. \"I never really did anything with it,\" notes Liles. \"I’ve played it out on some writers' nights, and it's sparked some interest here lately. People kept telling me that I should just put it out and let people have it.\"\n\nWhile Love and Theft continue to work in the studio on their forthcoming album with their soon-to-be-announced new label home, Liles took the opportunity to lay down a raw, acoustic track of 'Try to Make It Anyway' to give the duo’s fans a little something to have while they wait on the new tunes.\n\n\"This is actually one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever written,\" Liles says of the Swift-inspired tune. \"She’s awesome. I really dig Taylor. I dig what her and her family have done with her career, and I dig the person she is. I hope she's flattered by it. As far as I know, none of the other dudes she's been hanging out with have written a song about her!\"\n\nBesides laying down vocals for the new song, Liles, with the help of his friend Aaron Thomas, created a video for 'Try to Make It Anyway,' which is being streamed through Love and Theft’s YouTube page.\n\n\"Everything with this song and video just happened really naturally and easy,\" Liles says. \"It wasn’t like we had these big plans. Things just started working out. It's kind of fun to put something out like this. I’ve really enjoyed it, and everyone else seems to like it, so that’s flattering.\"\n\n'Try to Make It Anyway' is currently available for purchase on iTunes. Love and Theft anticipate making their big announcement about their new label home in the coming weeks. Until then, fans can log onto the duo's website for all of their current tour dates.\n\n\n\nRead More: Love and Theft’s Stephen Barker Liles Pens Song About Taylor Swift | https://tasteofcountry.com/love-and-theft-stephen-barker-liles-taylor-swift-try-to-make-it-anyway/?utm_source=tsmclip&utm_medium=referral",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: The Garden In The Machine\nWritten by Jim Malec May 2nd, 2011 at 7:30 am\n\n“Country music is truly music for everyone,” said Tim McGraw, as he and his wife Faith Hill prepared to announce the Country Music Association’s 2009 “Entertainer of the Year” award. “And that’s never been more apparent than with the diversity of tonight’s nominees.”\n\nIt was a line meant to acknowledge the presence of one nominee in particular, one fresh face among a field of perennial contenders: There was Kenny Chesney, who had won the genre’s most prestigious award the previous three years, and two-time winner George Strait. There was Keith Urban, a one-time winner and Brad Paisley, a three-time “Male Vocalist of the Year.”\n\nAnd then there was a girl. A girl who, at age 19, just happened to be the youngest artist ever nominated for the award – and the first female solo artist to be nominated since Faith Hill was so honored nine long years before.\n\nTaylor Swift’s hands flew up to cover her face as Hill announced her name. The crowd at Nashville’s Sommet Center erupted in applause. Swift stood up, looking genuinely stunned, and fellow nominee (and reigning champion) Chesney approached from a couple of seats away with a congratulatory hug and a kiss on the cheek. And then, the lanky teenager with the long blonde curls walked up the pathway to the podium, where she accepted country music’s most prestigious award from the man who her career-launching debut single was named after.\n\nIt was a perfect, full-circle moment – like the kind that happens in hope-inspiring movies about people’s dreams coming true. But while Swift’s rise to the pinnacle of country music stardom may seem like something from a Hollywood script – with that rise culminating in her unprecedented “Entertainer of the Year” victory just three years after the release of her debut album – the story of her journey to that moment contains less glitter and glamour than you might expect.\n\n“It didn’t happen like it does in the movies,” Swift says. “I look back and it seems like hundreds of thousands of tiny baby steps that lead to that moment.”\n\nIt’s often assumed that there’s something inherently manufactured about teenage stars who achieve incredible success, and that whatever genuine talent they possess has certainly been augmented and polished and manipulated in order to create a mass-marketable teen idol. But to whatever extent that process is a music industry reality, Taylor Swift is no product of it.\n\nSwift was just 11 years old when she first convinced her parents to take her Nashville – bearing CDs that featured her voice singing popular country songs over karaoke tracks – after watching a VH1 special about Faith Hill. She walked up and down Music Row while her mom and little brother waited in the car, introducing herself and spelling out her demands. “I’m Taylor Swift,” she’d say. “And I want a record deal.”\n\nThe response she received was less than encouraging.\n\n“I went back home after that trip,” she says. “And I realized that everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different. I need to have something to really bring to that town.”\n\nSwift retreated to the Pennsylvania Christmas tree farm where she was raised, and she started learning how to play the guitar. She also started writing songs, and found that it came naturally to her. And when she returned to Nashville the next time, a little over a year later, she was armed with an arsenal of her own material. One of those songs, “The Outside,” even made it onto her first album.\n\nPerhaps more important than the mere fact that she broadened her skill set, however, was the fact that through striking out to distinguish herself from the crowd she discovered her greatest passion. “Songwriting became my one true love,” she says. “It became the thing I could never put down. I became obsessed with it.”\n\nIn Nashville, writing and performing your own songs will open many doors that might otherwise be closed. In Swift’s case, one of those newly-opened doors led to the office of RCA Nashville Chairman Joe Galante. The 13-year-old Swift played a series of her original material for the legendary record executive, and she walked out of his office with a developmental recording contract.\n\nAnd then, about a year later, she walked away from that contract.\n\n“I wanted to be somewhere where the songwriting was placed at the forefront,” she says of her decision. “I wanted to be somewhere where I knew I would get to write every song on my album. I realized that that was where I wanted to place my priority. I wanted a publishing deal. So, one day, I walked into Sony/ATV and it was clear to me that they were really passionate about artists and about developing artists who were writers.”\n\nOnce again, Swift sat in an office, in front of an executive (this time, the office of publisher Arthur Buenahora) with just her guitar and her words. And once again, that was enough to impress the decision makers.\n\nSwift joined Sony/ATV at age 14, making her the youngest artist ever signed by that behemoth company. And then, she went to work writing with some of Music City’s biggest and brightest writers, including the likes of Angelo Petraglia, Brett James, Troy Verges, Mac McAnally and Brett Beavers.\n\n“I’ll never forget the days when I would be at school, and then my mom would pick me up and drive me downtown to one of those publishing houses. I’d walk in and write with a new songwriter almost every single day.\n\n”  The fact that most of those songwriters were at least twice her age wasn’t lost on her.\n\n“I knew that going into those meetings with those hit songwriters was something I was lucky to get to do,” she says. “And I knew that being a 14 year old girl, anybody would – understandably understandably – think, ‘I’m gonna have to write a song for a kid today’. But I didn’t want anyone to walk out of the meeting thinking, ‘I wrote a song for a kid today.’ So, I would walk in with 10 or 15 almost-finished songs. Or with developed ideas – finished melodies or choruses. I just wanted to make sure that everybody knew I was serious about it. That I didn’t just take it lightly.\n\n”  Of course, Swift doesn’t take anything in her career lightly. And that fact is reflected in her incisive, efficient songwriting. Even her earliest material is characterized by thoughtful – perhaps meticulous – word choice and deliberate melodic construction, with nary a lazy rhyme or aimless tune to be found. And that’s thanks, no doubt, in large part to those daily writing sessions, which she cites as learning experiences – both the great sessions and not-so-great sessions.\n\n“I’ve experienced almost every kind of writing session that you can experience: The kind where you try and write a song for seven hours, and you never end up finishing it. The kind where you write a song in 30 minutes. The kind where you’re writing with someone who clearly doesn’t take you seriously. Or the kind where you’re writing with someone who just gets you and gets what you want to say. But nowhere in that process – even during the bad or harder experiences I’ve had – did I ever sit there and say, ‘I’m at a disadvantage because I’m young. I’m at a disadvantage because I’m a girl. I’m at a disadvantage, I’m entitled, I deserve more respect.’ I have always been respectful of every situation that I’ve been in with other songwriters because I feel like you learn something from every experience – even the bad ones. If you have a writing session where someone doesn’t take you seriously and kinda scoffs at your ideas, you can make a note to self: ‘Never do that to someone else’. You learn something from everything that you go through. I know that, looking back, I learned something from every single experience that I had writing on Music Row.”\n\nOut of those writing sessions came one particular creative relationship that would become highly productive for both collaborators. Liz Rose, whose previous success as a songwriter was highlighted by Gary Allan’s hit single “Songs About Rain,” co-wrote two thirds of the songs that would become Swift’s eponymous debut album, including the lead single “Tim McGraw” and the smash hits “Picture To Burn” and “Teardrops On My Guitar.”\n\n“We fit really well together as a writing team,” Swift explains of her relationship with Rose. “Because she doesn’t sing or play guitar. She just lets me take the idea where I want to go, as far as the melody and the tone of what I would like to say to someone. Then she takes her life experience and her knowledge and her intuition and adds to it. And it’s just a really great collaboration.”  Swift’s debut album was released on Big Machine Records, an independent label launched in 2005 by industry veteran Scott Borchetta. Borchetta first became interested in Swift while serving as senior vice president at Universal Music, and convinced the young singer to sign with his startup company.\n\nThe album titled Taylor Swift was released on October 26, 2006. A collection of epistolic pop-country songs about the ups and downs of falling in and out of love, its first single was “Tim McGraw,” a coming of age ballad with a bittersweet undercurrent. The rest of the album’s songs featured tightly woven lyrics and firm hooks, and featured Swift’s exuberant – if not perfectly polished – vocals.   \n\nTaylor Swift sold just shy of 40,000 units in its opening week, a highly respectable figure. But as the weeks went on, and “Tim McGraw” climbed up the charts (eventually peaking at #6 in January 2007), the album did something that albums don’t typically do: it kept selling at a fairly consistent pace. In fact, it wasn’t until January 19, 2008 – 63 long weeks after it first appeared on the Billboard charts – that the album had its highest-selling week, moving approximately 47,000 units.\n\n“The sales of my first album really surprised me,” Swift admits. “After the first week, I thought to myself, ‘I would be incredibly lucky to see this album certified Gold. Or certified anything.’ And I was just hoping for the best and not expecting anything. You never expect that an album is going to pick up steam and start selling more and have its highest selling week way after the fact. I remember being on the road and opening up for Brad Paisley and Rascal Flatts and George Strait, and I’d get the sales for that week and think, ‘It’s really weird that it sold more this week than it did last week.’ I’d think that every single week, and I didn’t know what was doing it. All I knew was that I was signing autographs for hours every night after shows, and, you know, really getting to know my fans – and feeling a lot of love from them. But I guess it didn’t click with me that that might be driving a sort of viral record.”\n\nThe album spawned five Top 10 singles, including the #1 hits “Our Song” and “Should’ve Said No” – both of which Swift wrote without the guidance of a co-writer. It also established her as one of only a handful of new female voices to break out at country radio in a decade that was almost completely dominated by males.   That radio success didn’t come easily. Not only was Swift a female artist, she was a teenage female artist. And unlike LeAnn Rimes ten years before, her breakout wasn’t built on the novelty of a little girl with a bombastic voice singing a huge, adult song (“Blue”). To the contrary, Swift’s songs aimed to communicate with her social peers – and there was concern at radio about how that music would sound spliced into a format whose audience is firmly adult.\n\nSo, Big Machine turned to other avenues, including the Internet. Perhaps aided by the fact that she grew up as a member of the Internet generation, Swift was the first country artist to fully make use of available technological tools like MySpace (Facebook was only open to college students back then). And she used the website not only as a distribution medium, but as a way to build a connection between herself and her fans. She would write her own blog posts, leave comments on her “friends” accounts and personally respond to the messages that were sent to her. Before long, she had built a fan-base that radio couldn’t ignore.\n\nThe success of Taylor Swift set the stage for a highly anticipated follow-up album. That album was titled Fearless, and it sold nearly 600,000 copies in its opening week. Fearless charted 13 different songs on the Billboard Hot 100 (a record) and won the Grammy for “Best Album” – making Swift, yet again, the youngest artist to claim one of music’s biggest accolades.\n\nLiz Rose was again the most frequent co-writer on Fearless, but Swift wrote more than half of the album by herself. And whereas Taylor Swift seemed fully engulfed in the passions of teenage life, Fearless found a songwriter making bold steps into adulthood. Although the material found on the two albums shared themes, much of Fearless examined those themes through a more nuanced and less naive lens. On the song “Fifteen,” for example, Swift spoke to her audience not as a student, but as a seasoned survivor of those tumultuous high school years.  \n\nFearless would go on to blast Swift into the music world’s stratosphere, and mark her emergence as a pop icon. “Teardrops On My Guitar” had been a minor pop hit, but Fearless’ lead single, “Love Story,” climbed all the way to #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was a different song from that album, however, that would ultimately – though indirectly – lead to Taylor Swift becoming a household name.\n\n“Yo, Taylor,” said Kanye West, as he grabbed the microphone from a stunned Swift. Swift had just won the MTV Video Music Award for “Best Female Video,” for her song “You Belong With Me,” and was beginning her acceptance speech when the rapper interrupted her. “I’m really happy for you, and Im’a let you finish, but Beyonce (Knowles, who was nominated alongside Swift in the category for her video “Single Ladies”) had one of the best videos of all time. One of the best videos of all time.”   Kanye-Gate, as it would come to be known, thrust Swift into the pop culture spotlight. The clip played over and over on TV, and flooded social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, implanting Swift’s face into the public consciousness. And although it shook her personally, it had a profoundly positive impact on her career. At least in a way.\n\nWith superstardom, there are always associated costs. For instance, Nashville-based artists enjoy a relative safety bubble. Music City is a small community, in which all walks of the music industry live, work and shop together. Meanwhile, the non-music population is used to seeing stars out and about, and doesn’t make much of a fuss when Vince Gill pops into The Pancake Pantry, or when Keith Urban drops by the Green Hills Starbucks. Perhaps more importantly, the press contingent in Nashville is small, seasoned and respectful.\n\nBut the pop world is an entirely different world, one inhabited by shameless paparazzi and writers who have little sympathy for the way things are done in central Tennessee. And from that point on – and as Swift’s profile continued to rise – she would have to face an entirely different type of scrutiny than she had before. Both of the professional and personal variety.\n\nHer relationships with a series of celebrity beaus (including singer Joe Jonas, actor Taylor Lautner and singer-guitarist John Mayer), for example, went from tabloid footnotes to cover story material. And whereas before there had been only murmurs about a series of underwhelming awards show performances, criticism of Swift’s singing intensified.\n\nPerhaps the loudest of those criticisms came in February of 2010, when an industry attorney and blogger named Bob Lefsetz – who had previously been supportive of Swift – referred to her 2010 Grammy performance (a duet with Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac’s “Rhiannon”) as “dreadful,” writing: “Now everybody knows that Taylor Swift can’t sing.”\n\nAll of this turmoil would end up as fuel for the songs that would comprise Swift’s third album, Speak Now. On the album’s highlight track, “Dear John,” she speaks about – or more correctly, speaks to – Mayer in devastatingly direct terms, singing, “Don’t you think nineteen’s too young to be played by your dark twisted games” (while, at the same time, mimicking some of Mayer’s signature guitar licks). And she confronted the criticism of her singing – and perhaps Lefsetz’ criticism in particular – in a song called “Mean.” Indeed, throughout Speak Now, Swift’s material seemed sharper and more pointed than ever before.   “I think that the songs I wrote for Speak Now are really just like letters that I would have written to people in my life,” she says. “I’ve always approached songwriting from that angle, but these were very direct letters.”\n\nBut what about those criticisms? After all, it wasn’t just one disgruntled blogger grinding an ax. On more than one occasion, Swift’s singing has come under fire for being “off-key” or “pitchy.”\n\n“I think I’m confident about every aspect of my career, sometimes. But I’m never always confident,” Swift confesses. “I’m never always confident about my songwriting. I’m never 100 percent confident about anything that I do. And I think that keeps you growing. And I think that keeps you motivated. I never want to get complacent and I never want to be 100 percent confident about any skill that I have. It’s just not the way I think and not the way that you grow.”\n\nTaylor Swift is many things to many people. To her fans, she’s an immensely genuine songwriter who speaks about love and relationships in a uniquely candid voice. To a music industry perpetually reeling from declining album sales, she’s a saving grace who has sold over 13 million albums – more than any other artist to emerge in the Aughts. And, to her detractors, she’s proof that country music has strayed far from its roots, embracing songs for little girls that are sung by a singer who can’t sing.\n\nOf course, most of those detractors come from places outside of the country music family itself. Those who live and work in Nashville remember that little girl sitting in those writing sessions years ago, pounding away on her guitar and putting in the sweat equity it takes to “make it” in a town where overnight success almost never happens overnight. That’s why, on that 2009 night in the Sommet Center, there was nary a sound of protest when her name was called. Indeed, generations of country music artists, industry executives, musicians and songwriters applauded so fervently not because Taylor Swift is a nice person (she is) or humble (she’s that too) or even because she’s the most iconic superstar the city has seen since Garth Brooks.\n\nThey applauded because Taylor Swift is a great songwriter, who writes with an unmatched and almost unnatural acuity. It’s that acuity that led the legendary Kris Kristofferson to effusively tell veteran music journalist Chris Willman, at a charity event in 2010, that Swift is, “already in the hall of fame!”\n\nIn spite of her immense talent and all of the accolades and superlatives piled on her, however, perhaps the most remarkable thing about Taylor Swift is that she remains just a girl with a (sometimes broken) heart full of stories to tell. And even in the face of enormous wealth and fortune, she remains strangely normal – and completely in touch with reality. Unlike so many of her peers, she has neither fallen into a glamorous lifestyle full of parties and excess, nor has she bemoaned her emergence as a public figure.\n\n“Sometimes I look back in my journals from when I was 13 and 14 years old. Every night, I would write about how badly I wanted to be a musician and to be known for making music – and how badly I wanted to be on the stage, and how badly I wanted that to be my fingerprints. I wanted to be known for the words that I write and the songs that I sing. And that’s never changed. At no point have I ever lost perspective that I am so incredibly fortunate to get to do this.”\n\nIt’s a good bet that Speak Now will be strongly represented when the next batch of awards show nominations rolls around. But asked what she’s most excited about for her future, Swift finds it hard to look much further than the 2011 world tour that will take her across North America and Europe. Aside from that, she says, her goal is much the same as it’s always been – to keep growing, and to keep making records that she’s proud of. And, of course, to stay as “normal” as any person in her position possibly can.  “\n\nI do think normalcy is really important,” Swift says. “And I know that a lot of different artists and a lot of different people who are in the public eye have different opinions of what normalcy is. But for me, normalcy is going out in public and not wearing dark sunglasses because you’re trying to disguise yourself – it’s just going out and talking to your fans when they want to come up and say ‘hi.’ I love that. That’s what I wanted my entire life. And it’s all on your perspective and on how you look at things. Nothing is ever going to be given to you for free. If I balance out the joy that comes from this career that I have and all the love that is sent my way from my fans, I think that highly outbalances the scary things, like you know, the threat that comes from being out there in the public eye. I think the fans outbalance anything scary or inconvenient about it.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Teases Song Written During 'Crazy, Emotional' Time\n\nTaylor Swift sat down with MTV News on Tuesday night to chat about her latest music video, for \"The Story of Us.\" During the discussion about the Noble Jones-directed, Vanderbilt University-set video, fans who submitted questions on Twitter wanted to know more about Swift's songwriting process. She said that touring can be the best time to write tracks, even teasing some song ideas for her follow-up to Speak Now.\n\nWith Swift's next tour set to kick off on Friday, the singer revealed that a song she wrote on her last tour could make the final cut for her next album, whenever she feels the need to begin work on it.\n\n\"I was in Madrid, and I was in my hotel room all day. And I was going through this crazy, emotional [thing] and I wrote a song about it and it'll probably be on the next record,\" she teased. \"I'm telling you that. I'll tell you [the title] afterwards.\"\n\nThat isn't quite the strangest place that Swift has ever received some inspiration. During the sit-down, she opened up about getting an idea for a song and having to be creative about how she jotted it down.\n\n\"The weirdest [place] I have ever written a song is probably in an airport, and I got an idea so fast that I had to run to the bathroom at the airport, grab a paper towel and write lyrics on the paper towel,\" she explained. \"I still have it. I still have it in a box in my room.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift's musical evolution has been pretty clearly aligned with her age. While she's writing about love and heartbreak, as she did when she was a teenager, the way she expresses that joy and pain has grown from the puppy-love lyrics to more mature reflections.\n\nBack in the day, on her self-titled debut album, she was writing odes to country superstars, like in \"Tim McGraw,\" and using metaphors to try to understand emotions that she hadn't yet fully experienced. With a career in full swing and a highly publicized love life, three albums later, it's apparent that Swift drew on real-life experiences for Speak Now.\n\nWhen she sat down with MTV News earlier this week during \"MTV First: Taylor Swift\" Sway asked what she felt about her musical coming of age. \"I don't know,\" she said. \"I think retrospect will tell a lot. Years from now [and] I'll look back and go, 'I didn't know anything then.' \"\n\nSwift said the biggest difference between her teenage songs and her current ones is \"the kind of things you say when you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I had this song called 'Picture to Burn,' that's talking about how 'I hate your truck,' and 'I hate that you ignored me,' 'I hate you,' \" she explained. \"Now, the way that I would say that and the way that I would feel that kind of pain is a lot different.\"\n\nBut Swift has no regrets about her earlier songs. \"But I think that my first record came out when I was 16, the next one, Fearless, came out when I was 18 and this one came out when I was 20, so I think there's a lot of personal growth.\n\n\"I look back on the record I made when I was 16, and I'm so happy I made it,\" she continued. \"I got to immortalize those emotions that when you're so angry, you hate everything. It's like recording your diary over the years, and that's a gift.\"",

The gentlemanly Sway later handed her flowers. And so it seems there's no lack of love there.",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Taylor Swift: You asked, she answers\nIn an exclusive interview, the young star takes on your questions about love, fame and overcoming rejection.\nBY BRIAN MANSFIELD\nIN A REHEARSAL space near down- town Nashville, Taylor Swift is working on songs for her summer tour. Dressed casually in a summery blue and tan dress with her hair pulled back in a single braid that hangs below her shoulders, she plays a crystal-studded guitar while she sings a sad waltz, then switches it out for a banjo as her band kicks into her latest country hit, Mean.\nNow 21 and living on her own since moving out of her parents' house 20 miles away last June, Swift calls her mid- town Nashville penthouse \"a wonderland\" of barn-wood floors, reclaimed brick walls and mismatched kitchen décor.\n\"The best thing about being on your own is having that sanctuary,\" she says, settling her slender frame into a leath- er couch. \"That place that's yours.\"\nThis week, Swift lands in Columbus, Ohio, on the first leg of an ambitious, six-month North American tour that takes her to 30 states and Canada. And Wednesday, the country star is up for three awards at the CMT Music Awards.\nBefore she hit the road again, we asked the country sensation if she would answer some of the thousands of questions submitted online from USA WEEKEND readers. Here's what she told us:\n\nNow that you have moved out, what do you miss most about living with your mom?\n-Ashleigh Soden, Sydney\nI don't miss that much about it, honestly! We see each other all the time still.\n\nDo you ever regret not going to college? - Elsilyn Zeider, Plymouth, Ind.\nNo. In order to keep perspective and to not be the girl who wants one thing her whole life then gets it and complains, I'm cool with the path I've chosen.\n\nWhen you write songs about your relationships with people, do you consider what their reaction will be? Amber Nichter, Crestwood, Ky.\nThe only thing I'm thinking about is the person I'm writing about. It's a little message in a bottle. Sometimes, the purpose of writing it in the first place is what the person will do when they hear it. The fact that other people come into the equation, that happens 50 steps down the line.\n\nDo you believe in love at first sight? Gabby Leigh, Rye Brook, N.Y.\nYes. For some reason, when you are with some people, you'd rather be closer to them than further away. You want to know everything about them. This cra- zy, immeasurable, intangible, magical chemistry happens with\ncertain people. When you have that, you have to know how rare it is. If you let it slip away, it's such a shame.\n\nDescribe your perfect date. -Tim Olund, Minneapolis\nIt has nothing to do with the date. It's all about who you're on a date with.\n\nWhy do you think guys still treat you badly if they know you'd write a song about it? Taylor Negron, Branford, Conn. \nThat's an excellent question!\n\nYour song lyrics have allowed the world access into your private life. Is there anything you wouldn't write about?\n- Rebecca Malone, Wilmington, Del. \nIf something has affected me deeply, I'm going to write about it. I don't put much of a filter on.\nI've written songs that were just anger rants. I don't usually play them for anyone, but it's nice to write them and rhyme that person's name with literally\n\nWhat will happen to career and music wher finally meet the guy of dreams?\nMilena Bozovic, Wood-Ri \n[incomplete] Well, it hasn't been a problem so far, so I'll address that when or if it ever happens.\nI'm a songwriter startin lege soon. Music is my lif I'm torn between pursu or a more realistic goal.\n-Sarah Stawski, Pit\nIf you love something than anything else in you that's the path you should follow. At the same time, nothing says you can't have two paths. It just depends on how much work you want to put into it.\nYou were bullied in school and wrote songs to help you cope. What advice can you give to young people about dealing with bullying?\n-Hillary Henderson, Hillsboro, Ore.\nThe most talented people I know and some of the most fasci- nating people I've met were the most uncool kids in their school.\nThe trials and tribulations in your life make you stronger. If I had the girls in front of me now who got up and left the lunch table when I sat down in fourth, fifth or sixth grade they did it a million times I'd give them hugs. The biggest lesson of all is that I never want to make anyone else feel that way.\nWhat do you do when you feel overwhelmed and want to be alone?\nGrace Dougherty, Seattle\nI sit on my couch under a giant quilt and watch Friends. My 10- disc DVD set has made me feel at home in places I had never been before. Halfway across the world, I put in Friends, and I am sudden- ly more at home.\nDo you ever miss being able to go out in public without being swarmed by fans?\n-Jill Page, Univer- sity Place, Wash.\nI can totally go out in public. It's a more social ex- perience now, but it's all good. I never want to be weird about pri- vacy or look at things from an un- healthy perspective, like people coming up and complimenting me\nOpening night of the Speak Now tour in Birmingham, England, March 23; with her mother, Andrea, at the Country Music Awards in Las Vegas, and with a fan before the show.\non my music is a bad thing. And I make a lot of new friends. I go walking all around my neighbor- hood and all around Vanderbilt University, and I've met some really cool people.\nWhat is it like to be living your dream? Is it everything you expected it would be?\nBrittney Hedrick, Bonita, Calif.\nIs it weird to say yes, it is every- thing that I wanted? I have the comfort of knowing that if I write something and I love it, other peo- ple will hear it some day. I didn't always know that. I used to get finished writing a song when I was 12, 13, 14 and 15 and think to myself, \"Well, no one's going to hear it.\" That was a sad thought.",

      "Transcript/Content": "One afternoon this spring, the twenty-one-year-old country pop star Taylor Swift was in the back seat of a black Escalade going up Madison Avenue, on her way to the annual Costume Institute Gala at the Metropolitan Museum. Swift is known for sparkly, beaded dresses that make her look like a flapper, but she had adopted a more polished look for the ball: a gauzy, black-and-peach dress by the designer J. Mendel spilled its train around her feet; her hair was up; her lips were dark red and her eyes were smoky. Swift was sending text messages. None of the car’s other passengers—her bodyguard, Greg, a burly former Washington, D.C., cop; her publicist, Paula Erickson, a tall blond woman in a black blazer—spoke. The only sound came from Swift’s iPhone, which emitted an occasional ding!\n\nAfter a minute, Swift looked up from her phone. “It’s so fun!” she said, talking about the ball. “One of my best friends”—the actress Emma Stone—“is here tonight. So that’ll be really fun, because the past two times I’ve been at this party I haven’t had any of my close friends.” She exhaled loudly. “Whew!”\n\nSwift is sometimes called a twenty-one-year-old 2.0—the girl next door, but with a superior talent set. She has an Oprah-like gift for emotional expressiveness. While many young stars have a programmed, slightly robotic affect, she radiates unjaded sincerity no matter how contrived the situation—press junkets, awards shows, meet and greets. (Both Winfrey and Swift made appearances at a recent Target sales conference, where Swift performed a funny song she’d written for the company, called “Red Shirt Khaki Pants.”) As the car turned onto Fifth Avenue, Swift recalled making a midnight trip, last fall, to buy her most recent album, the triple-platinum “Speak Now,” at a Starbucks in Times Square. She said, in a solemn whisper, “I was so stoked about it, because it’s been one of my goals—I always go into Starbucks, and I wished that they would sell my album.” I found it hard to believe that she could feel enthusiastic about a sales opportunity at Starbucks, but Swift was insistent. “You go to Starbucks and there’s only, like, two CDs for sale,” she said. “And I felt like that would be a really big deal if they wanted to sell one of my CDs.”\n\nThe limestone hulk of the Metropolitan Museum came into view. There was a tent in front of the entrance, covering a red carpet, and across the street a mob of screaming spectators stood behind a barricade. The car door opened, and Swift got out to chants of “Tay-lor! Tay-lor!” Easing herself onto the sidewalk, she proceeded to the base of the stairs, and struck a pose before a phalanx of cameras: a sultry, fierce expression, one hand on her hip, her eyes narrowed, her head cocked back. She seemed to age ten years.\n\nSwift has the pretty, but not aggressively sexy, look of a nineteen-thirties movie siren. She is tall and gangly, with porcelain skin, long butterscotch hair that seems crimped, as if from a time before curling irons, and smallish eyes that often look as if they were squinting. She loves to wear makeup, but it tends to resemble stage makeup: red lipstick, thick mascara. In a world of Lohans and Winehouses, Swift is often cited as a role model, a designation she takes seriously. “It’s a compliment on your character,” she told me. “It’s based on the decisions that you make in your life.” She is in the midst of her second world tour, and every show begins with a moment in which she stands silently at the lip of the stage and listens to her fans scream. She tilts her head from side to side and appears to blink back tears—the expression, which is projected onto a pair of Jumbotron screens, is part Bambi, part Baby June.\n\nSwift’s aura of innocence is not an act, exactly, but it can occasionally belie the scale of her success. She is often described using royal terminology—as a pop princess or, as the Washington Post put it recently, the “poet laureate of puberty.” In the past five years, she has sold more than twenty million albums—more than any other musician. And, in an era of illegal downloading, fans buy her music online, too. Swift has sold more than twenty-five million digital tracks, surpassing any other country singer, and she holds the Guinness World Record for the fastest-selling digital album, for “Speak Now.” Forbes ranked her as last year’s seventh-biggest-earning celebrity, with an annual income of forty-five million dollars—a figure that encompasses endorsements, products (this month, she releases a perfume with Elizabeth Arden, which is estimated to generate fifty million dollars during its first year of sales), and tickets. Her concerts, which pack both stadiums and arenas, regularly bring in some seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars a night. These feats are all the more impressive because Swift writes her own material—a rarity for a country singer, but especially unusual for a teen star.\n\nThat Swift is a country star at all might come as a surprise to the casual music fan, who probably knows her as a generic teen queen, supplying background music for slumber parties and shoppers at Forever 21. On her first album, which was released in 2006, when she was sixteen, Swift sings with a twangy Southern accent, and makes references to God and pickup trucks. But she veered deeper into pop territory with her second record, “Fearless,” which won four Grammys in 2010. It is a collection of guitar-driven hits with a slick, commercial sheen. The typical Taylor Swift song is gentle but full of insistent hooks; it features Swift’s delicate voice, singing about love in all its variations—or, as she told me, “Love, and unrequited love, and love that didn’t last, or love that you wish had lasted, or love that never even got started.”\n\nThe setting, on her first two albums, is high school, but the lyrics are layered with dreamy images that could have come from the romantic imagination of a much younger child—princes, fairy tales, kissing in the rain. One of her hits, “Love Story,” recasts the tale of Romeo and Juliet in a small town, with a happy ending: “Marry me, Juliet, you’ll never have to be alone!” Others are wistful, and sometimes theatrically sad. In “Forever and Always,” Swift sings about a failed relationship: “It rains in your bedroom / everything is wrong! / It rains when you’re here and it rains when you’re gone!” It’s easy to imagine a chorus of young voices belting out the words from the back seat of the minivan.\n\n“If they say ‘Rubensesque in their profile they mean theyre a Botero.”\n“If they say ‘Rubensesque’ in their profile, they mean they’re a Botero.”\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\n\nShop\nBut Swift has also won the approval of people in the music industry, from Neil Young (“I like Taylor Swift. I like listening to her”) to Dolly Parton (“Taylor Swift is the greatest thing that’s ever happened to country music”) to the rock critic Robert Christgau, who said of her previous album, “The level of craft made the narrowness of focus forgivable.” She has won virtually every industry prize—an A.C.M. Award for Entertainer of the Year, a C.M.T. Award for Video of the Year, and a Grammy for Album of the Year—and she has been nominated for six categories at the upcoming C.M.A. Awards, more than any other solo artist. Her work has received almost uniformly positive reviews, although most of them portray her more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary. “Swift is a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture that . . . calls to mind Swedish pop gods Dr. Luke and Max Martin,” Jody Rosen wrote in Rolling Stone. “If she ever tires of stardom, she could retire to Sweden and make a fine living churning out hits for Kelly Clarkson and Katy Perry.”\n\nLike Parton, Swift writes autobiographical songs, a technique that, in the Internet era, is a clever marketing device. After “Speak Now” was released, last fall, Swift became known for writing about her celebrity boyfriends: the “Twilight” actor Taylor Lautner, the Disney star Joe Jonas, the singer John Mayer. “Dear John” includes the line “Don’t you think I was too young to be messed with?” (Mayer was thirty-two when they dated.) After the album’s release, public scrutiny of her love life blossomed into something like a stalker school of literary criticism. One blogger analyzed the lyric “I ran off the plane that July 9th,” and figured out that the song was about Jonas: “She flew to Dallas on July 9, 2008, to sit in the audience for a Jonas Brothers show.” In its first week, “Speak Now” sold more than a million copies.\n\nVIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER\n\nA Century in Detroit\n\n\nSwift is tolerant of her fans’ interest in her love life, as she is of gawkers who approach her on the street. “It’s human nature!” she told me. While she doesn’t talk about dating in interviews, she helps amateur sleuths along, using capital letters to spell out coded messages throughout the lyrics in her liner notes that indicate which boyfriend the song is about. Swift has an affinity for codes and symbols. Onstage, she shapes her fingers into a heart—“I did it at a concert one time, and people screamed, so I just kept doing it,” she said—and appears with her lucky number, 13, written on her right hand in Sharpie. More recently, she has been scrawling lyrics, such as U2’s “One life, you got to do what you should,” on her left arm; deciphering the references has become another fan activity. Swift’s ability to hold her audience’s interest reflects, in part, a keen understanding of what fuels fan obsession in the first place: a desire for intimacy between singer and listener. She told me that the best musical experience is “hearing a song by somebody singing about their life, and it resembles yours so much that it makes you feel comforted.” Her Web site includes video journals and diary-like posts to her online message board, which Swift does not outsource. Her fans, who call themselves Swifties, respond with passionate testimonials—“i would drink her bathwater”—and confessions about their own crushes: “Jake. Jake. Jake. Jake. I can’t say it enough. I just love the sound of his name.”\n\nOn the red carpet at the Met, Swift stood still before the cameras. Then she walked up the stairs, letting Erickson usher her through a series of TV interviews. She addressed each reporter, “Hey! I’m Taylor. Nice to meet you.” Paparazzi swarmed for a better angle. “Miss Swift, right here!” one shouted. When a civilian wandered into their sight lines, a photographer bellowed, “Please! Step away from the beauties!”\n\nAs other guests arrived—the brown-haired “Twilight” star Ashley Greene, Harvey Weinstein—the crowd formed a bottleneck. Swift neared the top of the stairs and froze. She grabbed Erickson’s sleeve in a panic: “Am I supposed to talk to him or not?” Standing by the door was the rapper Kanye West.\n\nTo some, Swift is best known for an episode at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. As she began to deliver a heartfelt acceptance speech for Best Female Video—“I always dreamed about what it would be like to maybe win one of these”—West, in sunglasses and jeans, strode onto the stage and grabbed the microphone from her hands. Hunched over, he announced, “Yo, Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’mma let you finish, but Beyoncé”—another nominee—“had one of the best videos of all time!” The moment, which had started out like a coronation, turned into something closer to a public shaming. Swift’s happy expression dissolved into shocked dismay as West handed the microphone back to her and walked offstage. Her mouth dropped open, and she seemed to sway a bit. She eventually left the stage without speaking. (Later that night, Beyoncé invited her back onstage to finish her speech.)\n\nThe event—replayed endlessly on television and online—ended in mortification for West. He unleashed an apologetic rant on his Web site (“i’m sooooo sorry to taylor swift and her fans”) and eventually took a year off to recover. President Obama called him “a jackass.” Swift will say only that the fallout was “handled very privately,” but she added, “I think that you learn a lot of lessons as you’re growing up, and one of them has to be human compassion.” Her last album includes a mournful song called “Innocent,” which is, presumably, about West. It concludes, “Who you are is not what you did / You’re still an innocent.” It’s a nice thought, although the tone is a bit grave: listening to it, you could get the impression that she is forgiving him for armed robbery.\n\nIf the Kanye West incident did not reflect badly on Swift, it did forecast some backlash about her ascent. Critics have always gone after her voice, which sounds warbly and sweet on albums but has sometimes been off pitch in concert. A few months later, at the 2010 Grammy Awards, she gave a disastrous live performance in which she harmonized off key with Stevie Nicks. Although she won Album of the Year that night, her singing prompted a flurry of comments along the lines of one made by the “Family Guy” creator, Seth MacFarlane, who said, “Maybe Kanye was right.”\n\nAt the Costume Institute Gala, Swift hesitated for a second, and then, realizing that there was no time to wait for advice, continued walking up the stairs toward West. As she neared the door, he held a hand out, and the two exchanged a studiedly casual, “down low” high five. When it was over, Swift stopped just inside the museum, looking giddy. Erickson let out a breath and exclaimed, “That wasn’t bad!”\n\nFeeling my eyes on her, Swift didn’t comment on what had just happened. Instead, she said, “I’m so glad I didn’t bring a purse this year!” Erickson handed her a ticket for the ball, and she ran upstairs to the party.\n\nSwift wandered through the museum’s Alexander McQueen exhibit, passing mannequins in bondage-inspired ensembles, ominous quotations painted on the walls: “There is no way back for me now.” During the cocktail hour, in the Petrie Sculpture Court, waiters in kilts held trays of champagne, but Swift sipped soda water and chatted with Gwyneth Paltrow. “I met her at Faith’s house,” she told me, referring to Faith Hill. “She is the best. You just end up telling her everything!”\n\nWendi Murdoch eyed Swift with approval. “I have a seven- and a nine-year-old daughter, and they love her music,” she said. “She makes me want to listen to country music more. Also, she’s such a professional and an artist. You don’t hear about any of the bad kind of behavior all the other famous young stars have. I love her music.”\n\nYou Belong with Me\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\n\nShop\nEarly adulthood is an awkward time for teen stars, but Swift’s has been free of embarrassing incidents. She doesn’t drink or go to clubs, and she has avoided the trip to rehab that marked the coming-of-age of the former Disney star Demi Lovato. She also hasn’t made the jarring transition to the darker, sexier material embraced by former teenyboppers Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears. Swift describes this decision as an artistic rather than a moral one. “I don’t feel completely overcome by the relentless desire to put out a dark and sexy ‘I’m grown up now’ album,” she told me. Still, her most recent record makes subtle references to more adult relationships, including lines such as “There’s a drawer of my things at your place.”\n\nAccording to reports in the press, Swift recently bought a Colonial-style house in Beverly Hills that would be right at home on Nantucket. (“I just love New England-y things,” she told me.) But her primary residence is in Nashville, a city that she said “is just everything. It’s just my favorite place ever.” A little over a year ago, she moved out of her parents’ house, in the suburbs, into a four-thousand-square-foot duplex penthouse in a Trump-like glass building called the Adelicia, in midtown Nashville. The building has concierge service and a pool scene, where a crew of Vanderbilt grads like to socialize around a fire pit. Swift bought the apartment when she was nineteen, when her friends all went off to college, and spent two years decorating it with antiques. “I was obsessive about turning my apartment into an art project,” she told me. “Everything’s mismatched, everything’s quirky.” The condo has an indoor moat, a night-sky motif on the ceiling, and a birdcage-shaped observatory.\n\nAt home, Swift spends most of her off time with band members, friends, and family—going out for coffee, cooking group dinners. When she’s on tour, she watches TV on her computer: “Teen Mom,” “C.S.I.” (on which she has guest-starred), and, recently, History Channel documentaries. “I’m just so obsessed with the whole history of J.F.K. and R.F.K.,” she said. She recently announced that she had completed a nine-hundred-page book called “The Kennedy Women.”\n\nWhen I visited Swift, she was rehearsing inside the Bridgestone Arena, home to the Nashville Predators. Twenty-two eighteen-wheelers were parked outside, bearing gauzy portraits of her face, along with the logo of Covergirl, which is sponsoring her tour. In addition to her perfume, she has sold greeting cards, a line of fourteen-dollar Walmart sundresses, Jakks fashion dolls—they wear Swift’s outfits and carry mini versions of her Swarovski crystal-encrusted guitar—and, on her Web site, calendars, iPad skins, Peter Max posters, robes, headbands, journals, and gift bags. Swift professes a kind of auteur approach to marketing. “I don’t believe in endorsing a product that you don’t want to endorse,” she said, with feeling. “I’ve always wanted to be a Covergirl. I’ve always wanted to have a fragrance, and so when it comes time to go on ‘Good Morning America’ and wake up really early in the morning to promote that fragrance I’m going to do it with a smile on my face.”\n\nSwift approaches her career with the seriousness of a C.E.O. Every two years, she puts out an album, for which she writes about forty songs. She composes by singing melodies onto her iPhone as voice memos, and writing down lyrics in the Notes section. “When I’m eighty,” she told me, “I imagine that I’ll wish that when I was twenty-one I’d gotten up early and gone out and walked to Hillsboro Village”—a shopping area near her condo—“and gone out and hiked and taken pictures of everything. And written in my diary more.”\n\nSwift clacked around the arena’s empty concrete halls in gladiator sandals, a flowered skirt, a tank top, and a long, droopy orange sweater. (She gets cold easily.) Her hair was in a loose ponytail, with curly tendrils falling down around her face, and she had on her bright-red lipstick.\n\nOne of the dancers in the show ran by in a hillbilly outfit. “That’s cuuuute!” Swift said, pointing. The dancer did a little curtsy and said, “Do you want some grits?”\n\n“That’s Charity, who’s one of my best friends,” Swift said. She is especially close with Liz Huett, a backup singer, and Caitlin Evanson, her violinist. The three share a dressing room, and, when I was there, they were all lying on a couch with their legs draped over one another.\n\nDespite this coziness, the atmosphere of a Taylor Swift tour is professional, if not downright corporate—less “Almost Famous” than Apple board meeting. The tour is run by Robert Allen, a pudgy, gray-haired Englishman whose brother is the drummer for Def Leppard. Allen is given to rah-rah statements about the size of the production. He told me, “On the scale of all the tours that I’ve done, personally, it’s as big as it gets. The fact that we’re in seventy-one arenas and eight stadiums and two of those stadiums are back to back—that’s a ‘wow.’ That’s rarefied air there.” The other major player is Swift’s mother, Andrea, a large, imposing woman with a blond bob and Swift’s narrow eyes. When I arrived, she was holding a list of statistics to recite when giving backstage tours—“all my facts,” she called them. She handed the list to Swift, who read them out: “We travel an average of three hundred and fifty miles per night. Eighty-two set carts. Ninety instruments—violins, percussions, banjo, a harp. Approximately eight miles of electric cable get put up per day.”\n\n“Eight miles,” Andrea Swift repeated, proudly.\n\nTaylor Swift contributes to every detail of the show. “You have to,” she told me, “or else you’ll have these surprises pop up. And you don’t ever want to be caught by surprise when you’re touring.” As a manager, she cuts a figure not unlike that of the teen-age monarch in the 2009 film “The Young Victoria,” gracious and vulnerable but also, given her position of power, a bit terrifying. People bring her things: bottles of water, a Styrofoam bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.\n\nAt one point, Swift and her mother were backstage, preparing for a meeting about onstage video content. Swift said, “Do we have the DVD? Because the ones that they gave me yesterday I left in my condo.”\n\nIt turned out that an assistant had forgotten them. Andrea Swift groaned. “How many ways did we express to Britney that we needed those DVDs?”\n\nSwift took the fall. “It’s my fault, ’cause I was watching them last night,” she said, sounding dejected.\n\nHer mother adopted a gentle tone: “Honey, if we had to count on you to remember every little detail it certainly wouldn’t work.”\n\nSwift’s businesslike approach could be considered a natural result of her background. She was born not in the small-town South but in Reading, Pennsylvania. She was brought up in the nearby suburb of Wyomissing, where, she told me, “it mattered what kind of designer handbag you brought to school.” The older of two siblings—her brother is a student at Vanderbilt—she grew up on a Christmas-tree farm, but her parents were not exactly farmers. Her mother worked in finance, and her father, a descendant of three generations of bank presidents, is a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch. (He bought the tree farm from a client.)\n\n“You run into a window too”\n“You run into a window, too?”\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\n\nShop\nEarly on, Swift assumed that she would follow her parents into business. “I didn’t know what a stockbroker was when I was eight, but I would just tell everybody that’s what I was going to be,” she recalled, during an online Q. & A. with fans. “We’d be at, like, the first day of school and they’re, like, ‘So what do you guys want to be when you grow up?’ And everybody’s, like, ‘I want to be an astronaut!’ Or, like, ‘I want to be a ballerina!’ And I’m, like, ‘I’m gonna be a financial adviser!’ ” But she eventually had a country-music epiphany, inspired by listening to nineties crossover hits—Faith Hill, Shania Twain, the Dixie Chicks. The melodies were good, but she especially liked the storytelling. “It was just such a given—I want to do that!” she said.\n\nSwift’s adolescence was dominated by a yearlong period of exile, when a group of friends ditched her, pronouncing her “annoying.” “That’s quoted,” she said. “We had these catty little I.M. conversations when we were in sixth grade.” The ditching probably had something to do with the fact that Swift was becoming recognized for her singing: she had performed at a 76ers game. (There is a YouTube clip of a chubbier Swift, in a headband and cardigan, belting out the national anthem.) But it might also have been related to her natural primness. She recalled an incident from seventh grade: “At the beginning of the year, we were all sleeping over at somebody’s house and”—she broke into a mock whisper—“they were all talking about how they wanted to sneak over to this guy’s house because this guy had beer. And I was just, like”—she affected a panicked voice—“ ‘I want to call my mom! I want to call my mom! I want to call my mom!’ ” She told me, “My whole life I’ve never felt comfortable just being . . . edgy like that.”\n\nSwift had already decided to become a songwriter. When she was ten, her mother began driving her around on weekends to sing at karaoke competitions. Then she persuaded her mother to take her to Nashville during spring break to drop off her karaoke demo tapes around Music Row, in search of a record deal; they didn’t succeed, but the experience convinced Swift that she needed a way to stand out. Songwriting became a sanctuary from the horrors of middle school. “I couldn’t wait to get home every day and write,” she said.\n\nThe Swifts continued to return to Nashville, where Taylor played in industry showcases; at thirteen, she was offered a development deal by RCA, a Sony Music subsidiary. The following year, the Swifts moved. Her father transferred to the Nashville office of Merrill Lynch, and the family bought a large house on a lake in Hendersonville, Tennessee, a borderline rural area where Johnny Cash used to live. (It provided the small-town imagery for Swift’s lyrics.) Swift enrolled at a public school and experienced a social revelation: “Everybody was so nice to me! They’re all, like, ‘We heard you’re a singer. We have a talent show next week—do you want to enter?’ ” The RCA deal eventually fell apart—Swift walked away, after the label decided to keep her in development for too long—but by then she had also secured a songwriter’s publishing deal with Sony/ATV Nashville: she was the youngest songwriter the company had ever signed. Arthur Buenahora, the Sony executive who signed Swift after she played a few songs for him on her guitar, said, “The songs were great, but it was her, really. She was a star. She lit up the room.” He added, “I liked her attitude. She was very easy to root for.”\n\nSwift, as a teen-age singer-songwriter, was an anomaly in the country-music industry. The predominant model is the songwriter workshop: writers churn out material in groups of two or three, and the results are hawked by a song-plugger, so that superstars like Tim McGraw can pick their favorites. There had, of course, been other teen-age singers—from Tanya Tucker to LeAnn Rimes—but they often performed material written by and for middle-aged listeners. Swift recalled, “I remember auditioning for record labels and having them tell me”—she adopted a snobby voice—“ ‘Well, the country-radio demographic is the thirty-five-year-old female housewife. Give us a song that relates to the thirty-five-year-old female, and we’ll talk.’ ” It’s since become a Nashville truism that Swift tapped into an audience that hadn’t previously been recognized: teen-age girls who listen to country music.\n\nSwift’s songs were different both in their personal dimension and in their subject matter. Peter Cooper, of the Nashville Tennessean, suggested that the best precedent might be Janis Ian, whose song “At Seventeen” swept the charts in the seventies with its raw portrayal of adolescent angst. “At its best, country music is a reality format,” he said. “What Taylor did was to write her own experiences, nearly in real time, and speak directly to her audience about what she was going through—which was what they were going through, too.”\n\nShe didn’t do it completely alone. As part of her publishing deal, she was matched with professional songwriters. Her mother would set up the writing sessions and drive her there. She eventually began writing regularly with Liz Rose, a middle-aged Texan who co-wrote many of the songs on her first two albums. Rose perhaps has a career incentive to play up Swift’s role in their collaboration, but they both describe it as an equal one, with Swift providing a line, a scenario, or a hook—often about something that was going on at school—and the two of them improvising the rest. For the hit “You Belong with Me,” a song about having a crush on a boy who is with someone else, Swift said, “I just came in and played the pre-chorus and the first half of the chorus for Liz”—she started singing—“ ‘She wears short skirts / I wear T-shirts,’ and she goes, ‘Something about bleachers!’ ” The finished line: “She’s cheer captain / and I’m on the bleachers.”\n\nSome have objected that Swift promotes a noxious, fifties-style ideal of virginal, submissive femininity. Critics take issue with “Fifteen,” a song that Swift wrote, at seventeen, about the joys and pains of first relationships. The song sketches out the experiences of Swift and her best friend from high school, Abigail, a University of Kansas student who has become a demi-celebrity among Swifties. It moves from Swift’s positive memory (“And then you’re on your very first date and he’s got a car and you feel like flyyyyyin’!”) to Abigail’s disappointing one (“Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind”) and concludes with a coy hint about Swift’s future: “In your life you’ll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team.” Sady Doyle, the author of the blog Tiger Beatdown, interpreted “Fifteen” as an implicit morality tale. “The narrative here goes as follows,” she wrote. “There’s a girl who gets semi-sexual and regrets it (because boys want sex, and girls don’t), and a girl who doesn’t get up to much of anything sexual and ends up wise and happy.” One mother recently wrote on the Huffington Post, “Speak Now tour? More like Speak softly and smile a lot.”\n\nBut Swift’s lyrics, though they are not subversive, have a certain sophistication. There’s often a tension between the words and the music: angry songs sound upbeat, and sentimental songs are laced with intimations of future disillusionment. In person, Swift has a quietly ironic sense of humor. When I first met her, discussing the Costume Institute Gala, I asked, “So how do you feel about balls in general?” Swift seemed confused. Then she let out a cackle and said, “A-ma-zing! That was incredible. It’s going to be my new moment of the century.”\n\n“If we carpool we can all save some money on our midlife crises.”\n“If we carpool, we can all save some money on our midlife crises.”\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\n\nShop\nIn her sophomore year, Swift bought a car with the money she’d earned from songwriting—a silver Lexus SC430 convertible. “It was the car that Regina George drives in ‘Mean Girls,’ ” she said. “Because all the girls back in Pennsylvania idolized her, and I think I just thought it would be fun to have that car.”\n\nSwift’s story is often framed as an underdog saga, the triumph of a nice girl over mean ones, and of teen-age pluckiness over industry gatekeepers. It’s a legend that deëmphasizes the role of adults, although Swift’s parents have been a constant presence in her life—she has even written songs about them. I spoke to Andrea Swift one afternoon in Nashville, in what is called the T-Party Room. At every stop on the tour, six workers take five hours to transform a cinder-block holding room into an exotic tented emporium to greet fans. It feels like the refuge of a prosperous Bedouin teen-ager: a central column is decorated with snapshots (Swift making a heart symbol with Stephen Tyler), and swaths of purple, yellow, green, and red silk are draped from the top, Maypole style, forming a billowy ceiling. “Virtually everything in this room she’s picked out, either herself or through text,” Andrea Swift told me.\n\nDuring each show, Andrea Swift or an assistant scouts the arena and selects the most enthusiastic fans. She gives each lucky girl (they are usually girls) a wristband and invites her backstage later. The idea behind the T-Party dates to Swift’s early years, when she was opening for other country stars—Rascal Flatts, Brad Paisley, George Strait. “She would wait until the headliner got back to his bus, was having his nightcap, and was going to bed,” Andrea Swift told me. “And that’s when we would hit the concourse level for her to sign autographs.” She said that her daughter was unimpressed with the way meet and greets usually worked. “She was, like, ‘You know, if I was ever a headliner I would want to pick out people in the audience that were just so crazy and fanatical—they’d be the ones that got to come back.’ She didn’t want you to V.I.P. your way in or bribe someone or sob-story your way in. It’s just basically the fans who it would really mean the world to just sit down and have fun and talk to her.”\n\nAndrea Swift affected a note of nonchalance when I asked her about her involvement in her daughter’s career. “Well, you know, she’s just been doing this for so long that, to me, this is just like soccer practice,” she said. Swift’s father, Scott, whose look includes tasselled loafers, was more direct. He said, “I’m not taking her money, if that’s what you’re saying.”\n\nWhile I was in Nashville, I went to see Scott Borchetta, the head of Swift’s record label, Big Machine. Borchetta, a former Universal executive, left to start his own operation, and Swift was his first client. At the time that he signed her, he already had a reputation for being, in the words of the songwriter and producer Robert Ellis Orrall, “one of the best radio-promotion guys in the business.” His office is on Music Row, in an unmarked frame house whose exterior state of dilapidation, an assistant explained, is a disguise: “So we don’t have eight-year-old girls knocking on doors giving us their CDs.” Behind the peeling paint, the building resembles an outpost of Soho House—diamond-plate steel-covered doors and scores of gold and platinum records on the walls. In the basement is a map of the world stuck with multicolored pins. “Those are our territories,” Borchetta, a paunchy man with a goatee, told me. Swift has sold more than three million albums internationally—an extraordinary number for a country act—and Borchetta outlined the plan of attack: Australia is next. “We were able to really infiltrate Japan over the last year,” he said. “I think she’s at the point now where it’s probably time for her to do a movie and soundtrack. Because she’s gotten to this kind of embeddedness, if you will, with where we are in American culture.”\n\nSince 2007, the Swifts have been in litigation with Dan Dymtrow, a former manager of Britney Spears, who claimed that they had violated a 2004 contract with him before Taylor signed with Borchetta. In papers filed in a New York court, Dymtrow challenged Swift’s origins story: “How does an eighteen-year-old singer from a small town in Pennsylvania make it to the cover of Rolling Stone’s ‘Best of Rock 2008’? If you believe the version of the story being told to the world, Taylor Swift knocked on record-company doors when she was just thirteen years old.” Dymtrow argued that, instead, he had launched her career by bringing in branding consultants, setting up performances (one, he noted, was a venue known as Rudy Giuliani’s Camp), and securing marketing deals with companies like Abercrombie & Fitch. The case is being settled out of court; a judge threw out all of Dymtrow’s claims except one, for unjust enrichment. While the litigation didn’t derail Swift’s career, it did provide glimpses into the adult negotiations inevitably at work behind a teen-age success story. At one point, Dymtrow’s lawyers released an e-mail written by Swift’s father to Borchetta that was quoted in the press: “Enough with the Dymtrow. You asked me to break both his legs, wrap him in chains and throw him in the lake. I did.”\n\n“Hey, check, one, two. Hello? Hello, hey. Stadium. Hello?” Swift’s phone was not getting a signal. It was late afternoon, and she was now in Detroit, preparing to play the first stadium of her tour: Ford Field, which seats fifty thousand people, and, five years ago, hosted the Superbowl. Like all her tour dates, it had sold out in less than five minutes. “The only time when I’m alone is when I come into the venue earlier than everybody else,” she said. She sat on the floor of her dressing room, a bare stadium space accessorized with scented candles, puffy purple couches, and lamps with the tags still on them. She was barefoot, wearing jeans and a red plaid shirt, with her hair in a ponytail. Except for a certain high-sheen exquisiteness—thinness, the lipstick—she looked like a regular college student.\n\n“Yeah, check, one, two,” Swift said. She was talking to her management office about an album of pictures from the tour, which would be sold at merchandise stands. Beside her on the floor was a stack of dummy pages, which she’d covered with Post-it notes. She flipped through the pages and read off critiques: “I’d really like to take out the 3-D element”; “Does it bother you that I have a hair scrunchy on my wrist for some of the pictures?”; “O.K. ‘Love Story’? The one where I’m coming down the stairs? I look like a big, giant cat.”\n\n“Would it help if I trimmed my annual bonus”\n“Would it help if I trimmed my annual bonus?”\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\n\nShop\nWhen I arrived, she had been bent over a glass coffee table, writing thank-you notes to local radio-station managers. The cards, which she had helped write and design, were from the American Greetings line. Some of the styles are glitter-encrusted, with Swift’s handwriting on them, and messages that echo her song lyrics: “You know how sometimes—right in the middle of a moment—you already know it’s one you won’t ever forget?” Swift had contacted American Greetings with the idea for the cards. “Part of the reason I wanted to do it was because I go through so many cards on a weekly basis,” she said. “I like writing ’em. And I like stamps.” As she wrote her thank-yous, Swift referred to notes about each radio-station worker that she had made on her iPhone. She signed a card:\n\nEric!\n\nThank you so much for coming to my show the other night, it meant a lot to see so many of my friends from the station. And thanks for coming to say hi to me backstage!\n\nLove,\n\nTaylor\n\nSwift’s penchant for thank-you notes and thoughtful gestures may be a talisman against the fickleness of public opinion—or fate. She is an incessant worrier. “I’ve been watching ‘Behind the Music’ since I was five, and I became fascinated by career trajectories,” she told me. “Like”—she adopted a TV-announcer voice—“ ‘This artist peaked on their second album. This artist peaked on their third album. This artist peaked with every album. These are singles artists. These are album artists.’ ” She went on, “And I sometimes stress myself out wondering what my trajectory is—like, if I sleep in and wake up at 2 p.m., because I’m so tired from the night before, sometimes I’ll beat myself up, because what if I was supposed to wake up earlier that day and write a song?”\n\nSwift’s career role models are not the Madonnas and Beyoncés of the world but the singer-songwriters—Bruce Springsteen, Kris Kristofferson, and Emmylou Harris. “They’re so known for their thoughts, and the things that they’ve written, and the things they’ve created,” she told me. “They’ve evolved, but they’ve never abandoned their fans.” (Robert Christgau thought that Harris made sense, but he said that the Springsteen aspirations were a stretch: “She has a much more contained and crafty relationship with words.”)\n\nSwift told me that she is taking control of her career, now that she’s no longer a teen-ager. Her parents, she said, “have been staying home more” (although one of them was at all the shows I attended). And, although she has acted in the movie “Valentine’s Day,” and hosted “Saturday Night Live,” and plans to do more acting, she flinched when I mentioned the plan for global domination that Borchetta had mapped out for her.\n\nIn Detroit, Swift seemed somewhat melancholy. Once in a while, I had the feeling that she was on the verge of bursting into tears. She said that she had recently decided that life is “about achieving contentment. . . . You’re not always going to be ridiculously happy.” She had written about ten songs so far for her next album. Asked to characterize them, she said, “They’re sad? If I’m being honest.” The most recent one, she said, “is about moving on.”\n\nAt one point, her security guard, Greg, came in, carrying a pair of portable iPod speakers. “Yes!” Swift said. “Where did they find them?” (Swift’s life sometimes resembles an extended iPhone commercial.) She plugged her phone into the speakers, and played a mournful country song: “Well, they ain’t gonna make a movie about a couple of fools like us.” “This is my time to hang out with Lori McKenna, who I want to be when I grow up,” Swift said, of the singer. “She’s a mom, and she lives in New England with her five kids. And she wrote ‘Stealing Kisses,’ by Faith Hill. She wrote that!” She fixed me with an intense look before cuing up another song, and asked, “Have you ever had your heart broken?”\n\nListeners to Swift’s most recent album will get the impression that she has. The songs, which she wrote without collaborators, are extra long, and cover a multitude of relationships, in moods that range from regret to a surprising, and somewhat satisfying, cattiness. Besides “Dear John,” about John Mayer, the upbeat, guitar-driven “Better Than Revenge” is, according to fan speculation, a takedown of the actress Camilla Belle, who dated a former boyfriend of Swift’s. The chorus rhymes “she’s an actress” with “she’s better known for the things that she does on the mattress.”\n\nA perusal of the songbooks begs a logistical question: where does she find the time to date so many people? The answer seems to be that a little goes a long way. Many of the songs are based on a memory or on a flirtation. In “Enchanted,” Swift murmurs in a pleading voice, “Please don’t be in love with someone else.” It was inspired, apparently, by a brief conversation that she had, in New York, with the musician Adam Young, who performs under the name Owl City. The interaction was “just small talk and stuff,” Young told me. “She talked about how she grew up in Pennsylvania, I talked about how I grew up in Minnesota. She’s very genuine.” Swift’s hint in the liner notes spelled a-d-a-m. Her fans decoded it by tracking a word, “wonderstruck,” which Young had used on his blog. The word is now the name of Swift’s perfume—a seamless mixture of reality, romance, and marketing.\n\nWhen I asked why so few of her songs are about work, she said, “I don’t want to write songs like”—she switched into a monotone voice—“ ‘Today, I woke up in a hotel and went to a venue and wrote cards.’ Nobody wants to hear a song about that.”\n\nOne song from her current album is, however, about a professional dustup. “Mean,” an upbeat, unusually twangy number, calls out a bully (“You, with your switching sides and your wildfire lies and your humiliation”), and alludes to her success (“Someday I’ll be big enough so you can’t hit me”). At one point, Swift taunts, in a singsong way, “All you are is mean, and a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life.”\n\nThe consensus is that the song is aimed at Bob Lefsetz, a former L.A. entertainment lawyer who blogs about the music business. Lefsetz, who had at first praised Swift, reversed himself after her live performance at the 2010 Grammys, announcing, “Now, everyone knows that Taylor Swift can’t sing.” I talked to Lefsetz, who said that the song “Mean” had brought him daily hate e-mail. “I wrote that she couldn’t sing. People are saying, ‘Little kids like her, so who the fuck are you to speak the truth?’ ” But he stood by his argument: “Let’s say that you’re ugly, and you’re on the cover of Vogue, does that work for you? And the defense is ‘I’m a good person!’ Let’s say that you’re a really nice guy and play baseball for the Yankees and bat .100. ‘Oh, but he’s a nice guy!’ ”\n\nSwift refuses to defend her singing voice. She told me, “I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across.”\n\nA Taylor Swift concert begins with the massing, hours before showtime, of little girls outside the concert venue—the Hajj at Mecca, if it were sponsored by My Little Pony. There is a uniform: sundresses, cowboy boots. (Swift’s look during her early years.) Fans curl their hair into loose ringlets and write the number 13 on their hands. Many also carry signs, in the hope of being selected by Swift’s mother for the T-Party. For example: “I would be enchanted to see you.” Inside, video screens above the stage project text messages from the audience:\n\nTaylor you’re my idol\n\nWe love you more than we can say!!!\n\n“Its just if the TV isnt on I never know where to look.”\n“It’s just if the TV isn’t on I never know where to look.”\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\n\nShop\nAt one concert I attended, Tom Petty’s “American Girl” was playing on the sound system as fans filed in, a nod to the middle-aged chaperones in the arena. There are lots of mother-daughter pairs at Swift’s shows. In New Jersey, a mother accompanying her thirteen-year-old said, “There’s nothing like Taylor. I’m not worried about the words coming out of her mouth. Growing up, I remember my mom making me return a Rod Stewart album because of the song ‘Hot Legs.’ ” (For a contemporary example, one can attend a concert by Katy Perry and listen to a stadium full of thirteen-year-olds chant along with the song “Peacock,” which goes, “I want to see your peacock-cock-cock! Your peacock-cock!”)\n\nSwift’s entrance is all pomp and circumstance. First, her mother appears on the floor, and a wave of screaming breaks out. Andrea Swift walks the aisles of the arena, smiling and waving like a political wife, giving the occasional hug, and takes her place near the soundstage. Then Swift’s entrance is announced by sonic rumbling and by her recorded voice: “There’s a time for silence and a time for waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel and you so clearly know what you need to say, you’ll know it. I don’t think you should wait, I think you should Speak Now!” As the music starts, she sprints onstage in a glittery dress, and launches into the first song. Then she does her standing-still ritual, her eyes misting over while the audience screams.\n\nSwift’s songs may be wistful expressions of a teen-ager’s inner life, but her shows are huge externalizations of them—featuring a two-story stage, “pyro” displays, dancers, aerialists, and nine costume changes. Although the stories in her songs are somewhat oblique, her dance troupe acts them all out literally: “Speak Now,” a fantasy of a woman interrupting her crush’s wedding, is performed on a church set, complete with pews and bridesmaids. Swift, her hair in a ponytail, bobs and sings, “Don’t say yes / run away now / I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door,” and runs offstage with the dancer dressed as the groom. Cheesy, yes, but once, during this song, I noticed a grizzled rock critic in the row in front of me, cotton stuffed in his ears, tapping his feet.\n\nEventually, Swift moves to the B-stage, a little island with a glittery tree. She plays the ukulele and banters about love, saying, “We’re all hopeless romantics,” and “I think there’s really something special about a first kiss.” The subject of the songs, it becomes clear, is not really men—it’s more about the love affair between Swift and her audience. In Detroit, she said, “You know when you know someone really well and they can finish your sentences? I’m curious to know what it would be like to have fifty thousand people finish my sentences.”\n\nShe began to sing a soft, acoustic version of “Fearless”—“In a storm in my best dress, fearless”—and the entire stadium sang along. Standing on the floor in front of the stage were six sixteen-year-old girls holding hands and swaying, and a girl in a hijab sobbing as she sang the words. It was hard not to be a little moved, and not to feel relieved that the words being sung were, more or less, safe. At the show’s high point, the crowd-pleasing song “Love Story,” silver and gold confetti rains down, and Swift, wearing a princess gown, is launched above the crowd in a flying balcony.\n\nToward the end of the show, I followed a production assistant, Gabby, up to a row near the nosebleed seats, where two girls were holding a sign that read “Speak Now,” illuminated by clip-on book lights. They were Lidia Hencic and Anna McWebb, fourteen, of Waterloo, Ontario. They wore braces and Birkenstocks, and were jumping up and down like pogo sticks.\n\n“Have you ever met Taylor?” Gabby asked.\n\n“No!!!!!”\n\n“Want to meet her?”\n\n“Yes!!!!!”\n\nShe handed them wristbands and said, “Taylor’s mom hand-picked you.” The girls began convulsing with screams.\n\nIn the T-Party Room, the lights were low, and the anointed fans stood around in stunned clumps. An assistant had briefed each person on the protocol: “They have one group photo and absolutely no video. Taylor signs one thing per person. When she’s coming, that’s when to start the ‘Tay-lor!’ chant.”\n\nHencic and McWebb stood in a corner. They said they had sleepovers oriented around watching Swift’s videos. “We’re not really the boy-crazy type,” McWebb said. “We just want to be her friend.”\n\nHencic said, “I can relate to what she’s saying, even though I’ve never had a boyfriend.”\n\nAs the fans chanted “Tay-lor! Tay-lor!,” Swift appeared, in a baggy pink striped sweater, her hair in loose braids and her skin showing a faint layer of sweat. She started giving out hugs, her eyes crinkling as she smiled.\n\nSwift approached Hencic and McWebb, and said, calmly, “Hey, dudes!,” and gave them each a hug. She stood back to admire their sign, with its book lights. “This is so good,” she said, matter-of-factly. “I’ve never seen anyone do this before. It’s so crafty.”\n\n“You’re our idol,” McWebb said. “We watch all of your blogs.”\n\nSwift put a hand to her heart and said, “Thank you.

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Finds Her Place in New Orleans\n\nTaylor Swift, the young girl who sang about “trying to find a place in this world” as a self-conscious high school freshman, is without a doubt a bonafide and beautiful global sensation in the world of entertainment today. Where there is an award to be had for almost anything in the music industry, it’s usually a given that any nomination Swift earns easily morphs into a smashing and successful win for her.\n\nThe country-pop starlet recently won CMT’s fan-voted Video of the Year for “Mine” in June at the CMT Awards, the most esteemed award of the night, adding another notch to her densely-studded award belt. Swift has received awards for everything from the Academy of Country Music’s nod for Top New Female Vocalist in 2008 to Billboard’s Artist of the Year in 2009, plus a GRAMMY for Album of the Year in 2010 for her second album Fearless – and a whole slew of amazing others.\n\nBut there’s another great reason to call the golden girl of modern music a real winner: In May, Swift brilliantly turned her tour rehearsal show into the “Speak Now … Help Now” Concert Benefit, which raised more than $750,000 for victims of the recent devastating tornadoes in the Southeastern United States. Swift then kicked off the North American portion of her Speak Now World Tour 2011 at the end of May in Omaha, which will culminate in late November in New York City.\n\nNew Orleans is on her schedule as well, and Swift and her band will stop here for a sold out show at the New Orleans Arena on Wednesday, October 5. Swift recently shared with New Orleans Living magazine that she cannot wait to get here and enjoy the good food and the great people. And lucky local fans who managed to score a seat for Swift’s upcoming concert can count on not only enjoying a night of musical enchantment by a wonderfully talented young performer who has taken the globe by storm, but also bearing witness to a selfless, admirable young ambassador of good for this world.\n\nShe’s compassionate, innovative and a genius when it comes to charitable acts: “The original idea to open up our last rehearsal to the public for the “Speak Now … Help Now” Concert Benefit (came to me when) we were rehearsing for the Speak Now tour, and one of my dancers who lives in Alabama came in and showed all of us a picture of a cyclone in her backyard, and we were just floored. And then we turned on the news and we were watching the coverage. I just felt like if there was any way that I could help with all the damage done and all the families who lost their homes, I had to think of one. It came to me really quickly that here we are at rehearsal, in an arena where there are empty seats – what if we filled those seats and gave the proceeds to the victims of the tornadoes?”\n\nWhat she shared with the audience at the “Speak Now … Help Now” Concert Benefit in Nashville: “Good evening, Nashville, Tennessee! I’m Taylor! … You have never looked more beautiful! Thank you so much for hanging out with us tonight! You know, this night was originally planned as our last dress rehearsal before the Speak Now North American tour kicked off, which would have meant that it would have been us on the stage doing this for an empty arena – and I like it much better this way! What changed all of it was that one day we were at rehearsal and we turned on the news and we saw that our beloved friends and neighbors in the Southeast were losing their homes, losing their loved ones, losing everything due to tornadoes and I felt like if it was possible to help them in any way, we should do it. All proceeds tonight, T-shirts, merch, tickets, everything, will be going to the victims of these tornadoes. We don’t have the final tally yet, but we do know that so far, just based on tickets alone, you have raised over $750,000. So thank you from the bottom of my heart for being with us tonight. I cannot tell you what a difference you are making in the lives of our loved ones in the Southeast.”\n\nHer thoughts on classifying her thoughts: “These days, I’ve been trying to classify my thoughts into two categories: “Things I can change” and “Things I can’t.” It seems to help me sort through what to really stress about. But there I go again, over-planning and over-organizing my over-thinking!\n\nThe tricky, enthralling, lucrative business of love: “I write songs about my adventures and misadventures, most of which concern love. Love is a tricky business. But if it wasn’t, I wouldn’t be so enthralled with it. Lately I’ve come to a wonderful realization that makes me even more fascinated by it: I have no idea what I’m doing when it comes to love. No one does! There’s no pattern to it, except that it happens to all of us, of course. I can’t plan for it. I can’t predict how it’ll end up. Because love is unpredictable and it’s frustrating and it’s tragic and it’s beautiful. And even though there’s no way to feel like I’m an expert at it, it’s worth writing songs about — more than anything else I’ve ever experienced in my life.”\n\nIncredible milestones for a young ’un: At age 20, Swift became the youngest-ever winner of the music industry’s top honor, the GRAMMY Award for Album of the Year. At 17, she was the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a No. 1 country single entirely on her own. And at 14, she became the youngest person ever to be signed as a professional staff songwriter at Sony/ATV Music Publishing.\n\nRegarding rejection by labels over the years before her first album, Taylor Swift, was released by Big Machine Records in 2006: “I can understand. They were afraid to put out a 13-year-old. They were afraid to put out a 14-year-old. Then they were afraid to put out a 15-year-old. Then they were nervous about putting out a 16-year-old. And I’m sure if I hadn’t signed with Scott Borchetta (head of  HYPERLINK “http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Machine_Records” \\o “Big Machine Records” Big Machine Records), everybody would be afraid to put out a 17-year-old.”\n\nWhy her sophomore album was appropriately names Fearless: This is the girl, who at the tender age of 10, had the guts to take the stage at every karaoke contest, festival and county fair that passed through her hometown of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. Who at age 11 took a trip to Music City and left a trail of amused receptionists as she dropped off her homemade demo tape at every label in town. Who at age 14 became the youngest person to be sign as staff songwriter at Sony/ATV Publishing. This is the teenager who signed her first record deal before she could drive. This is the artist who had the guts to step from an ACM awards stage and into the audience to introduce herself to Tim McGraw live on national television – just seconds after playing the last chord of her first hit song that bears his name.\n\nWhy her third album, Speak Now’s sales and chart success is matched by its critical acclaim: Rolling Stone awarded the CD 4 stars, writing: “People like to fixate on Taylor Swift’s youth, as if to say, yeah, she’s pretty good for her age. But that just begs a question: Where are all the older people who are supposedly making better pop records than Taylor Swift? There aren’t any.” The New York Times calls Speak Now “the most musically diverse (album) of her career. … And it’s excellent too, possibly her best.” The Associated Press hailed Swift as “a country-pop Jane Austen.” “Brilliant,” raved the Hollywood Reporter, and Entertainment Weekly writes, “What Swift does extremely well is tell a story: Speak’s 14 tracks are perfectly contained snow globes of romance and catharsis, whole cinematic narratives rendered in four-to six-minute miniatures.” Us Weekly dubbed Speak Now “another unrestrained grand-slam,” USA Today says, “When Taylor Swift speaks on her new album, you should listen,” and People wrote that the “songs play out like journal entries in which the country-pop phenom lets it all out in delicious, narrative-driving detail.”\n\nSwift is already hungry for her October tour stop in New Orleans: “I always love going to New Orleans because it’s just the best place to try new restaurants. The food is so different from anywhere else in the country – it’s always so good! And the people in New Orleans are always so friendly!”\n\n-Christine Fontana",

      "Transcript/Content": "When Two Thumbs Down Are a Sign of Approval\nBy Marisa Meltzer\nAug. 9, 2011\n\nHAND gestures can be vulgar, but recently a demure, loving one has risen to popularity. To make it, curl the index fingers on both hands with the thumbs pointing down and join them to make a heart shape. Two people can make it together: a human version of those best-friends-forever lockets that break apart to be shared.\n\nThe “hand heart,” as it is known, has been flashed by young stars galore, including Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, Victoria Justice, Blake Lively, Jordin Sparks and an “American Idol” contestant vying for votes.\n\nKaty Perry, Lady Gaga, Steven Tyler, Jennie Garth, Wynonna Judd, Channing Tatum, Usher, Kylie Minogue and Janet Jackson have all been photographed making the gesture.\n\nAdvertisers have taken note: it has appeared in campaigns for LensCrafters and the clothing line Miss Me. A hand heart with the top fingers splayed apart like wings, however, was removed from a Virginia tourism ad after revelations that it was a symbol of the Gangster Disciples.\n\nAn intact hand heart is displayed during the credits of the reality show “Ice Loves Coco” and described (“you held you hands up / and they formed a heart in the air”) in a song, “I Corinthians 13:8-10,” by the indie rock band the Mountain Goats.\n\nThe hand heart is popular in the rave scene where tiggerlovesyou.com chronicles young people enthusiastically hand-hearting. Armin van Buuren, the popular Dutch D.J., has been known to do it during his live sets.\n\n“The heart-hand symbol means something between ‘I love you’ and ‘thank you,’ ” the country singer Taylor Swift said in an e-mail from her “Speak Now” tour. “It’s just a sweet, simple message that you can deliver without saying a word.” She added that she started doing it in pictures and out car windows during high school.\n\n“At the end of my sophomore year, I left school and went out on a radio tour to play free show after free show,” Ms. Swift wrote. “I was an unknown act playing shows night after night, and I was constantly trying out all kinds of different moves to try and get a response from the audience.”\n\nOne day during a festival, she said, she was in the middle of a song and decided to put her hands above her head in the heart shape. The crowd started doing it back and cheering.\n\nThe singer’s fans feel so proprietary about the gesture that a debate erupted on an online fan discussion board when Lady Gaga made the hand heart.\n\nA commenter going by the moniker Longlivetaylor wrote that it was “like a code word almost, special to us swifties and now everyone is going to start doing so it won’t feel special anymore.”\n\nBut will it become as universally recognizable as, say, the peace sign? Patti Wood, a media coach and the author of “Success Signals: Understanding Body Language,” called the hand heart a “trendy thing,” likening it to when in years past celebrities like Goldie Hawn would make the hands-in-prayer namaste gesture.\n\n“One performer or audience probably did it in an extraordinary performance,” Ms. Wood said. “It used to take longer for nonverbal culture to move. But now, with smartphones, it’s instant.”\n\nRegardless of its possible ephemerality, Ms. Swift still feels the power of the hand heart.\n\n“When the moment is just right and the crowd is screaming louder than any sound I ever imagined I’d hear,” she wrote. “I just want to tell them I love them over and over, but sometimes the simplest thing to do is to make a sign with your hands.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift is in the middle of a massive 99-date world tour, but she’s still managed to squeeze in a lot of him to her newest passion: American history. “I just read a 900-page book called The Kennedy Women, which dates back to the lineage of the first Kennedys coming from Ireland in the 1800s,” Swift says in the new issue of Rolling Stone, on sale tomorrow. “This morning I bought books about John Adams, Lincoln’s Cabinet, the Founding Fathers and Ellis Island.”\nDuring downtime from her tour she even attempted to visit the New York Historical Society. “But it was closed,” she says. “I almost cried.” Instead, she went to the Museum of Natural History.  “We saw the dinosaurs and stuff,” she says.  “Which was a close second.”\nShe’s also become very interested in music from the past. “I’ve been obsessed with Fifties and Sixties music, like the Shirelles and the Beach Boys,” she says. “Like ‘Wouldn’t It Be Nice’ – if I ever had a wedding, I’d walk down the aisle to that song.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "An upcoming Harmony Award and two sold out Nashville shows prove that MISS SWIFT is the city's \"it girl\" this month.\nFOR SUCH A YOUNG WOMAN, TAYLOR SWIFT HOLDS QUITE A BIT OF POWER.\n\nNot only is she one of the most gifted songwriters in the history of country music-but her stage presence only continues to improve with each tour. This month, fans and fellow music industry folk will be filling the Bridgestone Arena for two sold-out shows on September 16 and 17. Playing a show for thousands of screaming fans is something she's used to-but in front of her peers and in her home town it's even sweeter. With Sparks Fly, she hypnotizes the audience both with music and the excitement of full stage production.\nWhen not on stage, she's writing songs, spending time with her friends and posing as the face of Cover Girl cosmetics. Not such a bad gig for a girl who's barely legal. Add a new penthouse and a slew of awards to the mix and it gets even better. In fact, early this month, the committee for the Symphony Ball (one of Nashville's most prestigious events) will announce their plans to honor her with the Harmony Award at this year's ball (in December). This incredible honor only proves just how respected her talents are by her fans, peers and members of her home town community.\n\nWe got to catch up with her between tour dates about the show, biggest influences and of course, her Nashville Lifestyle:\nHow does it feel to have your own place in Midtown Nashville? I love living in Midtown. In 10 minutes, I can walk to Hillsboro Village through the Vanderbilt campus, past the gorgeous old stone buildings and churches. I love being so close to Green Hills and the Gulch and Broadway. Everything is two minutes away.\nWhat's your favorite thing about owning and having your own place? My favorite thing is getting to have my friends over and cook for them. Hanging out with friends at home always turns into some piano sing-along, so I have all kinds of percussion instru ments and guitars lying around. Also, living in an apartment motivates you to get out and get things done during the day. Something about living up in the sky, being able to see the whole city going about its day, makes you want to get up early and go accomplish things.\nIf you had a day to be anonymous in Music City, what would you do and where would you go? I'd just probably do the same things I usually do. It would be so depressing to think I couldn't go certain places because people know who I am now. I love going to the shops in Franklin and walking around the adorable areas in East Nashville (my fiddle player Caitlin's neighborhood) and walking to Starbucks in the morning. I love concerts at the Ryman, I like going to Target. These are all places where there are always lots of people around, but that's just kind of where I like going. It's not that big of a deal, really.\n\nYour top choices for a great meal in the city and what you order? Fido in Hillsboro Village-I like it for its atmosphere and energy. Everybody's always hanging out there, having lattes in mugs with cute little swirl designs on top. My friends and I like it because it's open late. Capitol Grille in the Hermitage Hotel-I took my par- ents there for Mother's Day this year, and it had this old school, back-in-time vibe to it. Sometimes I think every restaurant is trying to out-hip the others this one is really classic, and my brother and I were geeking out about the history of the Hermitage Hotel. Tokyo in Green Hills this place has a deck to sit outside and hibachi ta- bles inside, and the waiters and waitresses are so sweet and friendly.\nDo you have any favorite shops in or around Nashville? If so, any tips for great finds? I have so many favorite shops here. I love Gilchrist and Gilchrist, this family owned shop in Berry Hill. I bought a lot of cute decorations and furniture for my apartment there. For the girls who like shabby chic, go there. I really like the Hill Center area with Anthropologie and H.Audrey. Fire Finch and Pangaea in Hillsboro Village are so cute too. Fanny's House of Music in East Nashville has instruments, lessons, sweet ladies who work there and awesome vintage clothes, shoes and accessories (across the street is Pied Piper, get some ice cream there).\nIn five words or less, can you give us a few adjectives that describe your personality? Curious. Excitable. History-obsessed. Hopelessly, blindly romantic.\n\nWhat do you consider to be the best places to take out of town visitors coming to Nashville for the first time? If you're dealing with foodies, take them to City House in Germantown. If your guests like barbecue and a laid-back, front porch vibe, South Street is great. 12South is a really cool area and Burger Up is fairly new, plus the Frothy Monkey is next door for coffee. At least drive down Broadway and show them the honkytonks. Go to Pancake Pantry for breakfast. I like to drive down Music Row and show out of town guests how quaint and laid back our music industry has stayed, with major record and publishing companies in cute little houses. Also, the Belle Meade Plantation is awesome, and it's one of the first places I went when I first came here. I'm obsessed with the history of this town. I seriously park my car and read those historical marker signs when I see them.\nIf you had to leave home with only three items, what would they be? My contact lenses. My phone. A sharpie.\nWhat's on your playlist right now? Any new music you can suggest that our readers tune into? I like to listen to the radio in my car, either the country or pop stations in Nashville or Sirius XM. There's just something about the way music sounds when it's on the radio. Other than that, I'm always critiquing new mixes of songs for the next record (yes, already...). I love Lori McKenna and I think her album Lorraine is my favorite of the year.\nWho are your ultimate idols living in Music City, and do you ever get time to see them? I think my favorite person in Nashville is Faith Hill. She's been my idol since I saw her on both VH1 and CMT when I was about 10. I loved how she was taking country music to bigger audiences and her grace in the spotlight. Since I put out my first album, Faith has been a welcoming and warm presence in my life, time after time. She sends flowers on my birthday and sent me cookies when I got sick. Another one of my favorite people is Kenny Chesney. He's so supportive, and always makes sure I know he's in my corner. He sends little notes of encouragement, and I know I can ask him for advice any time. These are two people who had always been my heroes for their career accomplishments, and when I met them, they became my heroes for their characters.\n\nWhat are you most excited about going forward? Can you give us a little insight on what to expect from you in the future?\nI'm most excited about releasing more singles and making more music videos from my album Speak Now. I'm incredibly proud of this album and I can't wait to see what will happen as new songs get unveiled as singles. I love the tour I'm on, and it's a good thing because it isn't ending any time soon: I'll be on the Speak Now tour\nuntil spring of next year. I've been writing a lot lately for a new album (not to be coming out soon, I usually take two years to make an album). I have a perfume coming out in the fall, and I've been working on it all year, so I really can't wait for that. I've never launched a fragrance before, so this should be new and exciting!\n\nTell us about the single most intriguing element in your show this month. Any inside info on what to expect? My favorite thing about this show is that the stage and the mood are always constantly changing in front of you. People have compared it to a Broadway play, and I'll take that comparison any day. I love the drama of visual storytelling and the element of surprise that you can incorporate into a show. We spent half a year planning each moment that occurs on that stage, and the result is a show I'm really excited to play every night. Mostly, I'm happy that this show has become an extension of my imagination. Sparkles and all.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: The Single Life\n\nJanuary 17, 2012 1:01 AM\nby Jonathan Van Meter|photographed by Mario Testino\n\nPhotographed by Mario Testino\n\n\"This is what I've wanted to do my whole life,\" says the 22-year-old singer-songwriter.\nAs Taylor Swift embraces a glamorous new look, the country-pop sensation talks about fame, ambition, and the joys of being on her own.\n\nTaylor Swift is sitting in the front row of the Rodarte spring 2012 ready-to-wear show during New York Fashion Week looking prim, if not chaste, in an ivory-colored confection with long, lacy sleeves, a high neck, and a full-length skirt—a look from Rodarte’s fall collection that was inspired in part by the spirit of the Kansas homestead. It is the sort of getup that treads a fine line between sincerity and irony, between too-literal costume and clever fashion reference. In other words, it takes a girl with a special sort of moxie to wear it without looking like Melissa Sue Anderson from Little House on the Prairie. The fact that Swift is supermodel thin, towers over everyone (at five feet ten she clocks in at well over six feet in platform Miu Mius), and has skin as pale as a gold-rush bride’s—well, let’s just say she falls somewhere on the continuum from fetching to dazzling.\n\nThat irony is not Swift’s strong suit makes her triumph all the more satisfying: She is wearing the dress; the dress is not wearing her. Perched here among the professionally blasé, she is all smiley gee-whiz confidence, full of hugs and exclamation points. Strangely enough, her opposite is sitting just two seats down: Rooney Mara, still in Lisbeth Salander mode, wearing all black and looking pale-to-green spooky. An editor sitting nearby jokes that the two could be the good witch and the wicked witch from The Wizard of Oz.\n\nAs the models begin their procession, it quickly becomes clear that Rodarte, whose bad-witch aesthetic has made the Mulleavy sisters fashion darlings, has moved into Glinda territory. It looks as though they asked their casting director for an army of Taylor Swifts—lithe, pretty blondes with long, wavy hair, but wearing zombie makeup. Indeed, the entire collection—a parade of girly-pretty dresses, skirts, and hand-knit sweaters in a swirl of cornflower blue and sunflower yellow, with a few van Gogh Starry Night prints thrown in for good measure—looks as if it were designed for Swift. “I have never been to a show where I wanted to wear everything,” she says breathlessly.\n\nAfterward, as we plunge into the crush on the street to find Swift’s car and driver, I overhear someone describe the collection as “prom on acid.” It strikes me that Swift herself might be described as all prom and no acid—for a certain audience, her music and her look are stuck in teenage gear. Which is why it comes as a nice surprise to discover just how sharp she is. She is clever and funny and occasionally downright bawdy as we ride around town with a small entourage on this hot fall day, visiting designer showrooms.\n\nIndeed, one of the first things she mentions is the infamous honey-badger clip on YouTube that features a deadpan obscenity-laced narration. Swift knows every line—though she asks if her cursing can be off the record. She may be edgier than her image suggests, but she is not Courtney Love. She has a deeply ingrained sense of appropriateness. She also knows her audience—and knows that they aren’t ready for her to grow up quite yet.\n\nAs we crawl through lower Manhattan gridlock toward Alexander Wang’s showroom, we wind up in a conversation about how one never really gets over high school. If Swift has been criticized for being somewhat arrested in her creative development—stuck in prom, as it were—that tendency has lent her an uncanny ability to capture in her songs the vulnerable mind-set of teen girls everywhere. “Why you gotta be so mean?” she sings in the straight-up country song that defined her amazing year in many ways and has been nominated for two Grammys. Clearly, her school days remain all-too-vivid. Swift, who grew up on a Christmas-tree farm in rural Pennsylvania, tells me that when she was in fourth grade her family moved to Wyomis­sing, an affluent suburb of Reading. “So . . . middle school? Awkward,” she says, launching into the first of many comic riffs. “Having a hobby that’s different from everyone else’s? Awkward. Singing the national anthem on weekends instead of going to sleepovers? More awkward. Braces? Awkward. Gain a lot of weight before you hit the growth spurt? Awkward. Frizzy hair, don’t embrace the curls yet? Awkward. Try to straighten it? Awkward!” She starts to laugh. “So many phases!”\n\nAs hard as it is to imagine now, Swift always felt like an outsider. “I think who you are in school really sticks with you,” she says. “I don’t ever feel like the cool kid at the party, ever. It’s like, Smile and be nice to everybody, because you were not invited to be here.”\n\nWhen I confess I played the cymbals in marching band during my freshman year, she high-fives me. “All of my favorite people—people I really trust—none of them were cool in their younger years,” she says. “Because if you know how to be cool in middle school, maybe you have skills you shouldn’t. Maybe you know how to be conniving, like, naturally.” She laughs. “There’s always that seventh-grade girl who looks like she’s 25. And you’re like, How do you do it? How do you do it, Sarah Jaxheimer?” She lets out a comically ear-piercing shriek: “Why is your hair always so shiny?!” (Later, I Google Sarah Jaxheimer, and sure enough, she has perfect, lustrous Jennifer Aniston hair.)\n\nSwift finally stopped caring about being cool. “I think that happened as soon as I left school, when I was sixteen, because then all that mattered was music and this dream that I’d had my whole life. It never mattered to me that people in school didn’t think that country music was cool, and they made fun of me for it—though it did matter to me that I was not wearing the clothes that everybody was wearing at that moment. But at some point, I was just like, I like wearing sundresses and cowboy boots.”\n\nApparently, so do a lot of other people. A couple of weeks earlier I watched Swift perform for a stadium of 50,000 people in Philadelphia, for all intents and purposes her hometown crowd. I had never seen so many teens and tweens and little girls with their mothers in sundresses and cowboy boots. “I look out at the stadiums full of people and see them all knowing the words to songs I wrote,” says Swift. “And curling their hair! I remember straightening my hair because I wanted to be like everybody else, and now the fact that anybody would emulate what I do? It’s just funny. And wonderful.” The fact that Swift, at 22, already appreciates the delicious irony in that speaks volumes about her grown-up sense of perspective. That she’s also the only kid at the table when it comes to filling huge stadiums also suggests she has a heft beyond her years. How many artists can even fill a stadium these days?\n\n“Um . . . Kenny Chesney, U2, and Paul McCartney. There aren’t many stadium shows anymore,” she says. “It’s no small feat, and I know that. When you walk out onstage in front of 65,000 people, it can bring you to tears. If you really take it in at the end of a song and you hear that many people screaming, it will make you cry.”\n\nDo you ever get freaked out?\n\n“This is what I’ve wanted to do my whole life,” she says. “It never freaks me out. Never. Ever.” She pauses for a moment. “But you know what does freak me out? When is the other shoe going to drop? I am so happy right now. So I am always living in fear. This can’t be real, right? This can’t really be my life.”\n\n“You are so tall!” shouts Alexander Wang when he first lays eyes on Taylor Swift.\n\n“I think I am still growing,” she says. “I haven’t topped off yet.”\n\nWang discreetly checks out her look. “Is this Rodarte?”\n\n“Yes,” says Swift. “It’s from their fall collection.”\n\n“Well, it fits you perfectly.” And then, handing out fashion’s highest compliment, “You are sample-size!”\n\n“It’s really nice when I get on shoots and everything fits,” says Swift.\n\n“But I bet it also makes it difficult for you,” says Wang, “because they’re probably like, ‘Oh, she’s sample-size, and that means she can wear anything from the runway collection.’ And you’re like, ‘I am not wearing that.’ ” They laugh. The two head over to the clothes hanging nearby, Wang’s futuristic-BMX-sporty collection that he showed a few days earlier. He pulls something from the rack that he calls a “knit racing sweater,” and Swift says, “How Tron of you.”\n\n“She gets it! I love it!” says Wang, clearly charmed. They walk over to the accessories. “Need a motocross helmet?” asks Wang, who has designed one with flowers on it.\n\n“That’s amazing,” says Swift. “You should send one to Pink. She would love that.” There is something reflexively generous about Swift, who says to Wang as they hug goodbye, “I love how happy you are.”\n\nAs we ride the elevator down, Swift offers her take. “Some people just attract attention and excitement,” she says. “It’s kind of unexplainable. People study it. There’s a science to the It factor. There are certain people who elicit a really passionate response. It’s crazy. That’s my Alexander Wang theory.”\n\nI interviewed Taylor Swift over the phone a couple of years ago, and here are the things that I remember from that conversation that still ring true: She was (1) smarter than the average bear; (2) excessively gracious; (3) happy to talk a blue streak about music; (4) preternaturally ambitious; (5) delighted to discover that the town her family summered in—Stone Harbor, New Jersey—is the town where I grew up.\n\nNow, in the car on our way to Prabal Gurung’s studio in midtown, I tell her that I was just in Stone Harbor with my family, having lunch, and mentioned that Taylor Swift is sort of from there. “I am totally from there,” she says. “That’s where most of my childhood memories were formed.”\n\nShe goes on, “When you say, ‘I spent my summers at the Jersey Shore,’ people always say, ‘Oh, really?’ They think of the TV show. So I just say, ‘A cute little harbor town in New Jersey.’ As with her music, there is a sprinkling of fairy dust on Swift’s childhood memories of Stone Harbor. “We lived on this basin where all this magical stuff would happen. One time a dolphin swam into our basin. We had this family of otters that would live on our dock at night. We’d turn the light on and you’d see them, you know, hanging out, just being otters. And then one summer, there was a shark that washed up on our dock. I ended up writing a novel that summer because I wouldn’t go in the water. I locked myself in the den and wrote a book.” She stares at me, wide-eyed. “When I was fourteen.” She laughs. “Because of a shark!”\n\nPrabal Gurung’s studio is tiny. Five people, plus the designer—with his muscular arms and a pompadour—and the place is standing room only. Swift spots a photo tacked on the wall of a model in one of Gurung’s dresses. “I love Karlie Kloss,” she says and touches the picture. “I want to bake cookies with her!” And then she turns and looks at the racks of clothes, the collection Gurung showed on Saturday. “So, what’s going on here?” she says, taking control. Inspired by the Japanese artist Nobuyoshi Araki’s Sensual Flowers photography series, Gurung’s collection looks like a floral-print Rorschach test in violet and magenta and turquoise and black. “Very Katy Perry,” says Swift. She picks up a white blouse that is long in the back and short in the front and says, “A shirt mullet!” Finally she spots a skirt that makes her happy and sucks in her breath. “Oh, my gosh. This is beautiful. What made you think of this?”\n\n“I was thinking, What is a strong female? Doesn’t necessarily have to be tough. Could be pretty.”\n\nSuddenly, Gurung plants himself directly in front of the pop star, who is easily a foot taller, and says, “Well, I am sure you get this all the time, and I’m sure it’s redundant, but I am such a huge fan. I love your music. It’s really beautiful—but you know that. But more than anything, it’s the way that you have conducted yourself. Really. The way you handle yourself is incredible.”\n\nSwift lets out a heartfelt “Thaaaaaaank yoooooooou.”\n\n“No, no, seriously,” Gurung goes on. “Because it’s very easy to get carried away into the wrong things and be like the rest of them, but you have held your ground, and it’s really impressive.”\n\nSwift throws her arms straight out—“Give me a hug”—and envelops him.\n\nAs we leave, she says, “That kind of made my day. People don’t usually compliment your character.” She shakes her head in disbelief, and then a big smile spreads across her face. “And he had good hair. Good throwback hair.”\n\nOne day not long ago, Swift was interviewed onstage by Katie Couric at _Billboard’_s Women in Music luncheon. At one point Couric asked Swift a question she has heard many, many times before, which is, essentially, When are you going to have some sort of scandal or meltdown, or, at the very least, an embarrassing photograph? When I bring this up, Swift says, “Ever since I was sixteen, the question that I get in every single interview is ‘So, all the pop stars right now who are stumbling out of clubs and going crazy—are you going to do that?’ When I was younger, I had to be more insistent with people because they would say, ‘Yeah, they all say that when they’re sixteen, honey. Just wait till you’re nineteen or 20. That’s when it all goes off the tracks!’\n\n“But you know, as time has gone by, I’ve gotten that question less and less. I think, for me, the bigger pitfall is losing your self-awareness. Even though I am at a place where my dresses are really pretty and the red carpets have a lot of bright lights and I get to play to thousands of people . . . you have to take that with a grain of salt. The stakes are really high if you mess up, if you slack off and don’t make a good record, if you make mistakes based on the idea that you are larger than life and you can just coast.” She pauses. “If you start thinking you’ve got it down, that’s when you run into trouble—either by getting complacent or becoming mouthy.” She laughs. “And nobody likes that.”\n\nDo you ever lose it and act bratty?\n\n“Yeah, but if I do I usually spend the next four days apologizing,” she says. “I get post-conversation anxiety. ‘I am so sorry if I said something weird. Did I make that weird? I am sorry if I made that weird!’ ”\n\nI ask Swift what she frets about, and her answer reveals a potential downside to being born with so much drive. “I fret about the future,” she says. “What my next move should be. What the move after that should be. How I am going to sustain this. How do I evolve.” She lets out a big sigh. “I get so ahead of myself. I’m like, ‘What am I going to be doing at 30?’ But there’s no way to know that! So it’s this endless mind-boggling equation that you’ll never figure out. I overanalyze myself into being a big bag of worries.”\n\nBut Taylor Swift is a girl who likes to be one step ahead of everyone, even herself. “Lately I’ve been focusing on trying to be here,” she says. “Trying to be who I am, where I am, at the moment.” She laughs. “But, you know, I am having a big meeting with my team next week, planning 2013. Which makes it hard!”\n\nSwift splits her rare days off between her condo in Nashville (“very Alice in Wonderland imaginarium”) and a little cottage she recently bought in Beverly Hills (“cozy, Anthropologie, grandma chic”). She’s been spending time in L.A. because she’s quietly looking for the right role in the right movie. Does she feel pressure to work out? “I don’t ever want to be that person whose self-image overtakes who they are. I am not a fan of working out that much. There’s no regimen. There’s no personal trainer. I love to go hiking because it’s an experience. If I need to gain stamina for a tour, I will run every single night on the treadmill, but I don’t necessarily like being at the gym.”\n\nSwift is very close to her parents, Andrea and Scott Swift, both of whom are very involved in her career. I ask her to describe them: “Mom is calculated, logical, business-minded; kind but very, very direct. Makes you better by giving you these little pointers but doesn’t baby you. My dad is a Chatty Cathy, the social butterfly; friendly; knows everybody in the whole world by six degrees; tells me that every performance is the greatest he’s ever seen, every new outfit is the coolest. Constant cheerleader. It’s cool to have pie-in-the-sky Dad, down-to-earth Mom.”\n\nShe seems to bring both worldviews to her romantic life. As she puts it, “I think I am smart unless I am really, really in love, and then I am ridiculously stupid.” Swift has famously dated some famous boys—Joe Jonas, Taylor Lautner, John Mayer, Jake Gyllenhaal. When she was eighteen, Jonas notoriously broke up with her over the phone—in a call that lasted 27 seconds—an experience that fueled her songwriting. She wrote a damning song about Mayer called “Dear John.” She dated Gyllenhaal through the fall of 2010 (he broke up with her around the Christmas holidays). When I ask her if she is seeing anyone, she says, “I got nothing going on! I just don’t really feel like dating. I really have this great life right now, and I’m not sad and I’m not crying this Christmas, so I am really stoked about that.” Were you crying last Christmas? “I am not gonna go into it! It’s a sad story!”\n\nSwift is working on her fourth album: “There’s just been this earth-shattering, not recent, but absolute crash-and-burn heartbreak,” she says, “and that will turn out to be what the next album is about. The only way that I can feel better about myself—pull myself out of that awful pain of losing someone—is writing songs about it to get some sort of clarity.” Swift’s music is not exactly straight diary entry—it’s cleverer than that—but somehow the specifics of her past relationships continue to have a universal appeal. When I ask her if she can detail a few things she’s learned along the way, she seems delighted to play along. “I have red flags now,” she says.\n\n1. “If someone doesn’t seem to want to get to know me as a person but instead seems to have kind of bought into the whole idea of me and he approves of my Wikipedia page? And falls in love based on zero hours spent with me? That’s maybe something to be aware of. That will fade fast. You can’t be in love with a Google search.”\n\n2. “If a dude is threatened by the fact that I need security, if they make me feel like I am some sort of princessy diva—that’s a bad sign. I don’t have security to make myself look cool, or like I have an entourage. I have security because there’s a file of stalkers who want to take me home and chain me to a pipe in their basement.”\n\n3. “If you need to put me down a lot in order to level the playing field or something? If you are threatened by some part of what I do and want to cut me down to size in order to make it even? That won’t work either.”\n\n4. “Also, I can’t deal with someone who’s obsessed with privacy. People kind of care if there are two famous people dating. But no one cares that much. If you care about privacy to the point where we need to dig a tunnel under this restaurant so that we can leave? I can’t do that.”\n\nOur next stop is Joseph Altuzarra’s studio in the Garment District. “How did Alex’s stuff look?” says Altuzarra, referring to his good friend Wang. “His collection was supersporty like mine, right?”\n\n“It was great,” says Swift. “It was very race car–driver slash Tron slash ski slope slash parka-without-being-a-parka.” They walk over to a rack, and Altuzarra picks out a very sexy black dress. “That is soooo Jada Pinkett Smith,” says Swift. “She would look great in that.” Swift heads toward another black dress. “Ooooh. I like that. That’s what you wear if you are a spy.” Pause. “Or if you’re playing a spy on TV.” She holds the dress under her chin. “This is me if I was on Covert Affairs.” She pulls a sweater dress from the rack, and Altuzarra says, “You could wear that on Covert Affairs as well.”\n\n“No,” says Swift. “I would wear this on Without a Trace, if I was playing Samantha Spade.” She laughs at herself. “I watch so much TV.”\n\nIf at times she seems far younger than her age, Swift can also seem far older. At Madison Square Garden in November, near the end of her yearlong, 80-city, sold-out Speak Now tour, she invited Selena Gomez and James Taylor, two performers who couldn’t fall at more opposite ends of the spectrum. Even though Swift is “best friends” with the nineteen-year-old Gomez, one got the sense that she was much more excited about—and has more in common with—James Taylor, the 63-year-old songwriting legend.\n\nIt turns out that Swift has a laundry list of iconic American figures to whom she feels some sort of connection. “The only time in my life I have ever been starstruck was meeting Caroline and Ethel Kennedy,” she says. “I got to spend the afternoon with Ethel a couple of weeks ago. She is one of my favorites because you look back at the pictures of her and Bobby and they always look like they are having the most fun out of everybody. You know, eleven kids, all these exotic animals on their property. I’ve read a lot about them.”\n\nWhen I ask whose career she would most like to emulate, she places herself squarely in baby-boomer territory, identifying in some ways more with her parents than with her peers: “I look back and I think about Kris Kristofferson,” she says without missing a beat. “He is so versatile and so appreciated for all of the things that he has done. The fact that he shines in songwriting, shines in his solo career, shines in movies and does it all so tastefully. I got to meet him last year, and he’s just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn’t chewed him up and spit him out. He just seemed like the human embodiment of gratitude.” She ponders for a moment. “Sometimes you see these people who are just so—God—so affected by all of it, where ambition has taken precedence over happiness. But when I meet people who really embody this serenity of knowing that they have had an amazing life—James Taylor, Kris Kristofferson, and Ethel Kennedy. . . .” She smiles her twinkly-eyed smile. “They just seem to be effervescent.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "With a year to go before Taylor Swift expects to put a new album in stores, the singer says she's already recorded enough tunes to fill a double disc CD. During an interview with Ryan Seacrest Thursday morning, Swift revealed that she's been writing and recording since her last album 'Speak Now' was released. \n\n\"I've recorded 25 so far, and we have a year to go,\" Swift said. While most of the material on 'Speak Now' came within six months of the album's completion, the singer says she's been active for over a year. Many of the songs were written on her own, just a girl and her guitar with pen and paper at three o'clock in the morning.\n\n\"Being so busy there's not a lot of time to stop in the middle of the day and just kind of think about this feeling that you just realized about a relationship you had a year ago,\" Swift commented when asked why her best ideas come so late at night. \"The ones I love the most end up happening very quickly.\"\n\nTwo weeks ago, an article in the New Yorker shared that Swift hasn't been happy lately. When asked about the songs she'd written for the new album, she said, \"They’re sad? If I’m being honest.\" The most recent one, she revealed, \"is about moving on.” There's speculation that Swift has gone through a tough breakup this summer.\n\n\n\nRead More: Taylor Swift Reveals She Has 25 Songs Recorded For Next Album | https://tasteofcountry.com/taylor-swift-new-album-25-songs-recorded/?utm_source=tsmclip&utm_medium=referral",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift on ‘Speak Now’ Follow-Up: ‘I’ve Written 25 Songs So Far’\nThe songstress tells THR that she expects to have a new offering by this time next year.\n\nBy Sophie Schillaci\nOctober 19, 2011 8:37pm\n\nTaylor Swift is a busy woman.\n\nIn the midst of her worldwide Speak Now tour and promoting the launch of her very first perfume, Swift is also hard at work on what will be her fourth studio album. The songstress spoke with The Hollywood Reporter on Tuesday, Oct. 18, while meeting with Los Angeles fans who were anxious to get their hands on a bottle of her new scent, Wonderstruck.\n\n“I’ve written 25 songs so far, so it’s coming along really well,” Swift said of her follow up to 2010’s Speak Now. “I’ve been writing a lot, and I like to take 2 years to make a record. We’re at the end of year one and I still have a year left to go to write.”\n\n“It’s looking really great,” she added.\n\nBased on Swift’s three previous album releases, fans should likely expect a new offering in the fall of 2012. Her debut release, Taylor Swift, hit stores on Oct. 24, 2006. Her sophomore album, Fearless, followed on Nov. 11, 2008, while Speak Now made its debut on Oct. 25, 2010.\n\nThe 21-year-old is known not only for her heartfelt and storied lyrics, but a signature style both on and off stage. It isn’t often that Swift parts with her signature blonde curls (save for one show-stopping appearance at the 2010 American Music Awards, where she debuted bangs and a sleek, straight ‘do), but will she ever pursue a more drastic change?  \n\n“Yes, I have considered that on certain days,” she confessed. “I think about either cutting bangs, or cutting it. But I don’t think I’m ever gonna cut it drastically — at least not in the near future, because my publicist right now is sort of twitching with fear.”\n\n“I don’t want to shock people, that’s never been the goal,” she added. “But it might be nice to change things up every now and then.”\n\nPHOTOS: Teen Choice Awards Red Carpet\n\nThe singer’s scent is on sale now, retailing at $49.50. The Elizabeth Arden fragrance features notes of fruit and floral, with a touch of “sweet indulgence.” Swift is hardly the first musician to expand into the world of cosmetics, but she specifically credits Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani as her inspiration for creating a truly “signature smell.”",

It's very different in what it's about, but it's no different in the fact that it has its own name.\" Swift was on hand at the event with another honoree, Nicki Minaj, who is also set to release her new album in 2012, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded.\n\n\"I love her,\" Swift said of Minaj. \"One of my favorite moments of the tour was when she came out at the Staples Center and sang 'Super Bass' with me, which was, like, the coolest thing. It was like a dream come true, so it's amazing to get to run into her and see her around, and I'm just such a fan.\"\n\nSo would Swift possibly collaborate with Minaj on her next album? \"I mean, we're not working on anything right now,\" Swift said. \"But I would love to at some point. That would be amazing.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift ‘Daydreaming’ of Next Tour, Makes CMA History\n\nPublished: November 10, 2011\n\n\"The reason why we celebrate like we just won the Super Bowl is that my band and crew, the dancers, the aerialists, the catering crew, my family, friends and fans all over the world were paying attention tonight, and they were excited because they're part of this,\" Taylor Swift said backstage at the 45th annual CMA Awards, after scoring her second Entertainer of the Year win, the night's top honor.\n\nAccording to the CMA official website, the Entertainer award is given to the act \"displaying the greatest competence in all aspects of the entertainment field.\" In voting, CMA members are encouraged to consider not only an artist's recorded music but also his/her live performances, along with \"staging, public acceptance, attitude, leadership, and overall contribution to the Country Music image.\"\n\nWe'd say that pretty much defines Miss Swift, especially coming off of her elaborate, record-breaking Speak Now World tour. \"To look out into a stadium full of people is the most overwhelming feeling – it's a sea of people and you can't see the end of it,\" Taylor said Wednesday night after her big win. \"They're the ones who decide whether you're playing in a theater or a stadium. I'm absolutely in awe of the fact that they have taken it further and further and topped themselves every single year.\"\n\nLooks like the country superstar is topping herself every single year, as well. This was her second Entertainer of the Year win, with the first being in 2009, and her seventh career CMA victory. This year, Taylor beat out Jason Aldean, Brad Paisley, Blake Shelton and Keith Urban for the Entertainer honors in what was one of the most unpredictable categories of the night. Taylor now joins Barbara Mandrell as the only women in the CMA's 45 year history to score two CMA Entertainer of the Year trophies, and at 21-years-old she's the youngest lady in history to do so.\n\nThe North American leg of the songbird's Speak Now World tour wraps up later this month with two sold-out shows at New York's Madison Square Garden. She'll take a short break for the holidays before packing her passport for dates in Australia and New Zealand next year. And in true, hard-working Taylor style, she's already thinking about her next headlining journey.\n\n\"I am so proud of this tour, and the reason why it's so much fun is because I obsess over how to treat each song,\" says the newly-crowned CMA Entertainer of the Year. \"One of the things that I love about the Speak Now tour is that it's very theatrical, and each song has its own treatment. The reason I obsess over it so much is that I obsess over writing them so much ... With this next album, I'm so excited because I've been writing so much. We're still in the first gear of making it, so as we finish songs and demo them in my producer's basement, I can picture them being played on the stage.\n\n\"It's such a fun, daydreaming job to have,\" she continues. \"You spend so much of your time planning and daydreaming about the future, and it's a blast to get to call that a career.\"\n\n\n\nRead More: Taylor Swift ‘Daydreaming’ of Next Tour, Makes CMA History | https://theboot.com/taylor-swift-cma-awards-2012-tour/?utm_source=tsmclip&utm_medium=referral",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Bliss Exclusive: Jumping for Joy! \nShe's had her most successful year ever! Here's how Taylor took over the world - and how 2012 is set to be even better...\n\n\"Girl next door' must be one of the most abused clichés ever. You're more likely to live close to a little old lady or a grumpy man with a scary dog than the sweet, rosy-cheeked, gorgeous-but relatable I'll-tell-you-anything instant best mate. But Taylor Swift is the ultimate, made of fairytale girl next door- so much so that you expect to see her face pop up  when you Googlemap your house. BLISS has been lucky enough to hang out with Taylor a few times - we've even met her Mum and cooed over pics of her adorable new roommate, Meredith the Scottish Fold kitten. \nShe's so blimmin' down to earth that it's easy to forget how successful she is and just how much she's achieved. It's not just that she's beautiful, or that she has such a strong sense of style that her papped-getting-coffee look is as cute and distinctive as the outfits she wears to wow us on the red carpet. It's the blinding amount of talent. The talent to write songs that you, your big sister, your Mum and your Granny can all connect with. The talent to explore her deepest feelings with style and dignity. The talent that has everyone from J Biebs to T.I. queuing up to work with her. Even her ex-boyfriend Joe Jonas told us 'there's a great opportunity for the two of them to do a song together in the future. \nHer star just keeps getting bigger and brighter, and 2011 really was The Year of Taylor. Her tour took her everywhere from Canada to Australia, not letting a pesky bout of bronchitis stop her. In the meantime, she picked up a couple of awards-Entertainer of the Year, Top Country Artist, Top Country Album and Billboard Woman of the Year. Oh, and she's the youngest artist EVER to get that one! Obviously we'd love just a milligram of her success, but we're thrilled to see her get such recognition-it really couldn't happen to a nicer girl. So what is it that makes Taylor so lovely and shiny and sparkly? \n2011 was AMAZING for you! Can you fell us about your favourite parts? \n\"There were so many highlights of this year! The live shows and the touring was definitely magical. And, I got the idea to start inviting other artists to come out onstage and sing their hits with me, completely surprising the audiences-artists like Usher and Nicki Minaj and James Taylor! I loved how spontaneous that was.\" \nWe LOVED seeing you and Selena performing together on stage! Was that your idea? \n\"I wanted to have Selena come sing with me at my last show of the tour at Madison Square Garden because it really. meant a lot to me to be surrounded by people I love on such an important night. And after four years of friendship, we'd never performed together beforel It was such a blast-and something I'll always remember.\" \nIt sounds like it was as much fun to sing with her as it was for us to watch! Was your Christmas great too? \n\"I think what I love more than Christmas itself is the preparation and when all of the garlands and ribbons and lights are up everywhere. And everybody's thinking about snow and what to get for people they love. It's not hot here in Nashville at Christmas. It's pretty cold but it doesn't usually snow.\" \nAny other particular highlights for you from this past year? \n\"I also loved travelling all over the world playing shows. I'd never played big shows in Europe or Asia before this tour, and it was so exciting. Also, winning Artist of the Year at the American Music Awards, surrounded by friends and my brother, was definitely a highlight, and a feeling of accomplishment and shock! \nYou've done so much! Were there any fough parts that were difficult to get through? \n\"The toughest parts of the last year all had to do with jet lag and sometimes getting really tired after being gone for so long. But I've been on the road for a few years now, so you get used to being able to handle it.\" \nDid you get to meet new people and make new friends in 2011, or are you very protected by your security team? \n\"I meet a lot of new people all the time. I have security simply for the sake of making sure nothing goes terribly wrong. I don't have security so that they can keep new people from entering my life. I really love talking to people. I love meeting people.\" \nIs it easy for someone like you to make new friends? \n\"I have no qualification system for being my friend. It's really fun to go to a café and meet somebody new or hang out with a new group of friends. I just like taking chances like that. I don't ever want to get to the place where I'm a product that needs to be protected and shielded at all times and less of a person. That's just not really my style. I'm more casual about life than that.\" \nWe know your lucky number is 13-do you have any other lucky charms or superstitions? \n\"I love the number 13. It seems to pop up in front of me whenever something good is about to happen, and I've come to look at it as a sign that things are going the way they should be e going. The number 13 is definitely my luckiest lucky charm, but I also pick up heads-up pennies any time I see them.\" \nWould you consider yourself to be naturally lucky? \n\"I certainly think that I've been incredibly lucky, but I have also worked really hard. I think luck can help you on the way, but it can't build and sustain a long career. You have to do that by staying focused and always trying to outdo your past accomplishments. \nYou always seem really poised-do you ever get nervous? \n\"I've gotten starstruck a few times in my life. I got starstruck when I met Paul McCartney. I had no idea what to say to someone I admire that much. And another time was when Bruce Springsteen came to one of our shows and was watching from the front row. My band and I were so nervous and excited throughout the entire concert. But later, when I met Bruce, he was so engaging and down to earth that all of my nerves suddenly went away. It was just like talking to a friend, really. That was the most impressive thing about him to me.\" \nYou're kind of our idol when it comes to love advice! We're always looking to your songs for inspiration. Who has given you the best advice about love and relationships? \n\"I think my best advice has come from my Mom. She's always got an honest opinion that she never refrains from sharing, but she always seems to be right in the end. I've found that when it comes to love and relationships, my parents are almost always right!\" \nIs there a particular song of yours that gets misinterpreted, or do you think people can find their own meaning in your music? \n\"I like it when people make my songs their own by applying their story to my music. I may have written a song about one particular thing that happened to me, but the cool thing is that somewhere out there, it means something different to someone else. I like knowing that.\" \nThere's something in there for everyone! What do you enjoy most about the songwriting process? \n\"One of my favourite things about the last album is that I didn't have any co-writers Sometimes my strongest ideas come to me at the most inopportune times-like at 3am, or the middle of a meet and greet, or in the middle of a conversation. Those are usually the best ideas and often the most intense. I will end up tuming around and running away from the conversation so that I can go and record the idea.\" \nSo you find that songwriting still surprises you? \n\"Sure! Like, on Speak Now I did the pre-production work in this tiny studio the producer had set up in his basement. I'd come in to the studio with an idea that I thought was probably going to end up being a demo. Instead, it would end up being this magical recording that we couldn't bear to part with. We ended up recording about 60% of the album in his basement!\" \nAmazing! Where is that? \n\"It's here at home in Nashville. And then if we needed to, we go back and re-record some drums or a bass track or something. But everything started out in Nathan's basement with me playing acoustic guitar, him playing electric and singing background vocals.\" \nHow long did it take to write? \n\"I actually scrap a lot more songs than I record because I'm really picky about it. If you're gonna put out an album after two years, make it the best thing that you've done and have the best songs you've written in the last two years. I could have stopped writing after 14 songs and called it a day, but I wouldn't have been satisfied.\" \nWe're a bit obsessed with your sense of style-do you spend ages planning outfits? \n\"I am definitely guilty of throwing something on and going out. I don't really put much time into putting together outfits, but when I'm standing there in the closet I think, \"Focus! You only have 30 seconds before you go!' But I love doing my own make-up. I think it's really fun playing with colours and figuring out what I want my hair to look like. I'll take 25 minutes on that because it's just such a blast. And I'm obsessed with headbands! I have so many of them so I just love to pick which one will go with the outfit.\" \nOK, so what's the one thing you'd try to save if your wardrobe caught fire? \n\"None of my clothes matter. I'd just grab Meredith and run!\" \nHow is the adorable Meredith? You must miss her when you're travelling \n\"She's a really awesome cat -I've never had a pet that's just mine before! I take her with me when I travel, so she's gotten used to being in dressing rooms and planes.\" \nShe sounds very jet set... we're glad she's there to keep you company! \n\"It's really nice to have that constant source of humour and entertainment and companionship. Cats are always doing something ridiculous!\" \nTAYLOR TELLS US \nOne of my favourite movies is... Love Actually \nOn my last day offl \nWrote thank you aster, baked gingerbread cookies and watched TV. \nLast week I feasted on.. \nLots of lattes and tea, probably pizza at some point, and way pitty pleasure. meal, a cheeseburger and fries. \nWhen I do my make-up I always... Draw cat eyes with eyeliner. \nWhen I'm on my own l \nGet ansions that I'm missing set on something or not working hard carogh Then I give myself a pep talk that it'る okay to relax for a minste. Then I put sa music and realise I like alone time. \n24 BLISS ",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: Billboard’s Woman of the Year\nThe youngest superstar ever chosen as Billboard's Woman of the Year, Taylor Swift has enchanted fans, fellow stars and the music business alike. The \"Speak Now\" singer spoke with Billboard about her r…\nBy Tom Roland 12/2/2011\n\nAre there people you look to on the business side of what you do?\n\nThe business aspect is one of the most important things about having a music career, because every choice you make in a management meeting affects your life a year-and-a-half from now. I know exactly where I’m going to be next year at this time. That’s because I’m sitting there in those management meetings every single week and scheduling everything and approving things, or not approving things, based on what I feel is right for my career at this point.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, someone I look up to, [because] he’s gotten to a place where he’s one of the only artists playing stadiums, is Kenny Chesney. Seeing a live Kenny Chesney show, you know what you’re going to get. You know it’s going to be an all-day party. He loves to sing about things he’s passionate about, and he’s made a brand without seeming like it’s a brand. I love that he’s gotten to a place where he can play such huge stadiums, and even when he’s supposedly taking downtime he’s playing stadiums. He’s always been a huge hero of mine.\n\nI saw the Speak Now tour in Des Moines, Iowa, then a truncated version of it at the CMA Music Festival and then saw the show again in Nashville. Even though it was a production and certain things had to stay the same, it felt like the show had evolved.\n\nThank you. One of my favorite things about this tour-although it’s a very theatrical show, and it really reminds me a lot of my favorite musical theater productions in its scenery, costumes and production-there are a lot of moments in the show that are very spontaneous. I’m singing a different cover song every night on the B stage [at the other end of the arena], just me and my guitar. In those moments I can choose to play whatever the fans are wanting to hear or whatever I feel like playing that night. It’s been fun to be able to vary up the show so much, especially because you’ll have a lot of people who will come to more than one show, and I want them to get a different experience every time.\n\n\n Explore\n\nSee latest videos, charts and news\n\nYou’ve released a DVD of this tour. What went into the decision to do that? Why was it important to document this tour?\n\nI really wanted to make a DVD of this show because I felt this is a year of my life that I’m going to want to remember. Every single night I stand on that stage and it feels like it’s the best crowd of the tour every night. They are so loud and emotional and so passionate, and these crowds that we’ve played for this year have been unlike any crowd we’ve played for on any other tour, and this show has been different than anything we’ve ever put on. I want to look back on this years from now and show it to my kids and my grandkids.\n\nHave you ever had a year you just wanted to forget?\n\nNot an entire year, but I’ve had a six-month period I’ve wanted to forget-whether you’re talking about criticism or an awful breakup or whatever trauma you happen to be going through. Every single one of us has a few months here or there that feel like dark months. For me, what helps me with sad times or frustration or rejection is writing songs about every one of those emotions, and for some reason, after I do that and I’m proud of the song, things make a little more sense to me.\n\n\nYou said earlier that you already know what you’re doing a year from now. Dolly Parton has talked about mapping out her life in seven-year plans. How far in the future do you look? Do you have an idea where you want to be in 2018?\n\nI love that Dolly Parton plans out her life in seven-year plans. I thought that was brilliant. There’s so much about Dolly Parton that every female artist should look to, whether it’s reading her quotes or reading her interviews or going to one of her live shows. She’s been such an amazing example to every female songwriter out there. As far as in the next seven years, I’ll be 28 or 29, so I don’t know. It just depends who I meet. But I’ve always hoped that I continue to write music for the rest of my life, and the clearest future I see is always my next album because I’m always obsessed with the latest song I’ve written, my newest idea about the newest thing for my newest album. That’s been my obsession for the last six months to a year.\n\nIn country music, women were often marginalized, and Roy Acuff famously told Kitty Wells’ manager in the ’50s that a woman could never headline a tour. Clearly you’ve proven that’s wrong. Do you feel those barriers are broken down? Or is there still more work for women to do in the business?\n\nFor me, I’ve never really thought about boys versus girls. I’ve never thought about any kind of prejudice about women in country music because I never felt like it affected me. I was fortunate enough to come about in a time when I didn’t feel that kind of energy at all, and it was always my theory that if you want to play in the same ballgame as the boys, you’ve got to work as hard as them. I was always playing just as many shows as they were and playing on the same shows as they were. I was willing to pay my dues as an opening act, playing in clubs and bars and playing in tiny venues. The new male artists were doing the same thing, so I never saw an issue there.\n\nYou have scores of teenage fans, and many of them look to you as a leader and role model. Do you feel like you are a role model? How do you handle the idea that your words or actions may influence others?\nAs you enter down a career path it becomes very clear what that career path is going to ask of you. One of the things that is a huge part of making music and putting it out into the world is understanding that you now have a role in shaping the lives of the next generation. And you can either accept that role or you can deny it and ignore it and say it’s a parent’s job to raise their kids. But the reality is what you wear matters. If you’re a singer and on TV and in the living room of some 12-year-old girl, she’s watching what you’re wearing and saying and doing.\n\n\nFor me, when Faith Hill performed on an awards show, everything mattered-everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it. That’s what little girls do, so there is a big responsibility and I take it very seriously.\n\nBig Machine Records founder Scott Borchetta said that when you were starting out, you’d take your guitar everywhere and play for anyone to attract attention. Now there’s so much demand it could overwhelm you. Was there a moment when you realized you had crossed that line?\n\nI’ve always had a huge goal of never becoming one of those guarded, semi-paranoid, privacy-obsessed celebrity people. I don’t feel comfortable around people who always think someone’s trying to get something from them. I like having friends, and I like having a lot of friends. You end up with a very small group of people that can be around you if you’re very guarded, so for me I like to hug my fans and talk to them about their breakups and problems just like I did when I was 16.\n\nA lot has changed since then, but a lot hasn’t as well. I don’t want to be one of those people that doesn’t trust anyone. How are people supposed to trust you if you don’t trust anyone?\n\n\nYou’re known as a savvy user of social media, particularly in country music, and there are days when you’ll tweet a few times and then sometimes not at all. There are many people who tweet more than you do, so it seems the messages you send are pretty effective. In your view, how often should an artist tweet, and what do they need to be about?\n\nI don’t want my Twitter page to turn into something that’s operated by other people, and I don’t ever want it to be like, “Team Taylor fans, attention! This will be happening,” from some sort of webmaster. Sometimes I feel Twitter pages can become very promotional in their nature, and I don’t want that. I just want it to be where I can tell them, “Thanks so much for the [American Music Award] nomination,” or tell them what I’m watching on TV at that moment. I like for it to be a little bit random and spontaneous. I want it to be as human as possible, because it’s just me sitting there with my phone deciding what to tweet.\n\nIf you could go back to 2006 and offer yourself any advice, what would it be?\n\nI wouldn’t offer myself any advice, because I love how this has gone.",

She already has written 25 songs for her next release. “Speak Now,” by comparison, had 14 titles on the album’s standard version and 17 tracks on a Target-exclusive deluxe edition.\n\n“During the first year of writing the ‘Speak Now’ album, I was really writing songs that didn’t end up on the record because I didn’t know what the record was going to be,” she says. “Once I kind of locked into what the record was going to be, in the second year I wrote the songs that I was most proud of, like ‘Back to December’ and ‘Mean’ and the first single, ‘Mine,’ and a song called ‘Ours.'”\n\nNathan Chapman, who produced her albums, is overseeing the next as well.\n\nSwift wrote the songs on “Speak Now” by herself, though the credits will likely include a few collaborators the next time out.\n\n“I’ve had two co-writes, and I’ve written the rest of it by myself,” she says. “Co-writing is so much fun when you have time to schedule it in, but for me, usually songs hit me in the middle of the night and I end up writing it before dawn, so there’s no time to call somebody. When there is time and you can get in a room and talk it out and work it out with somebody, it’s like the coolest form of therapy.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Woman of the Year\n\nShe entered the music industry as a 14-year-old girl, but it's only now that Taylor Swift, 22, is being recognized as the grown-up artist she has become. Not only did she show off a sophisticated new look on the cover of Vogue, but Billboard named her its Woman of the Year. \"Whether I'm a woman now, or whatever, is up to my fans to decide, not for me,\" Swift told Billboard. The six-time Grammy Award winner has already amassed a life's worth of accomplishments, including selling 19 million albums and 42 million singles and helming one of the most successful concert tours ever. Firmly established as an industry player with clout, in 2011 Swift enjoyed dabbling in film (voicing a character in The Lorax), donating $1 million to charities, and launching her own perfume. Most likely, there will be no public melt- downs or rebellions from someone who is able to channel hurt into a song and have it go platinum, as \"Mean\" did last year. \"I really haven't felt the need to make some bold statement of maturity or make the 'dark' record yet.\" Swift said. Instead, \"I'm always looking ahead at what's next, and I'm intensely writing my next record right now.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Looking To 'Evolve' On Next Album\n'Love is always going to be a huge theme in what I write about,' singer tells MTV News after premiering 'Safe & Sound' video.\n\nIn 2010, Taylor Swift released the Grammy-winning Speak Now. The album was a study in the complexities of love and life, full of ponderings on the romance of new love and the pain of a broken affair. Drawing inspiration from her own life, the album topped the charts and kept Swift ever-present.\n\nAs she embarks on her next album release, she tells MTV News that she's still got work to do, even if her bosses at the record label are ready to pull the trigger on it.\n\n\"So far, I've been writing so much in the last year and the label keeps telling me, 'All right, we're finished; all right, we're satisfied; OK, this is done now.' And then I just keep writing and I keep turning it in in different versions,\" she told MTV News' Sway during \"MTV First: Taylor Swift,\" when she dropped her video for her \"The Hunger Games\" track, \"Safe & Sound.\"\n\n\"I'm going to work on it until I literally have zero time left to work on it, because I'm having so much fun working on this album,\" she explained. \"I made my last album, Speak Now, with this idea I really wanted to make an album without writing with anyone else just because I always wanted to do that. And now I have a different approach to this record. I'm getting to work with people that I've always wanted to work with.\" That means that she's seeking out some assistance \"from all different places in music.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to be as much of a sponge as possible,\" she explained. \"You have to evolve and try new things and change and that's what I've loved to do with this album.\"\n\nBut just because she's trying some new things musically doesn't mean she's quite ready to move on from writing about love.\n\n\"I think that love is always going to be a huge theme in what I write about just because there are no two similar relationships, there are no two times that you feel love the same way or hurt the same way or [feel] rejection [in] the same way. It's all different and I'm fascinated by that,\" she said. \"I really love to go back to human interaction and the way we make each other feel. But that at 22 is different than it was at 18 or 19 when I made my last album and 16 and 17 when I made Fearless. As you grow, you change in the way you process emotion.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift maps out film career\nBy: Ruben V. Nepales - ColumnistPhilippine Daily Inquirer / 07:21 PM April 01, 2012\n\nFollowing the huge success of “Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax,” where she voiced one of the characters, Taylor Swift is mapping out her movie career. Taylor told us that she had been reading scripts in recent years and looking out for roles that she could be passionate about and which could be worth taking a break (from her hectic music career schedule) for.\n\nBelow are excerpts from our recent interview with the singer-songwriter:\n\nWhat kind of movies would you like to do?\n\nI’ve been reading scripts for about five years— just kind of under the radar, asking my agents to please send me everything that might be good. In my free time I just read and read. When I look at acting careers that I really admire, I see that it’s been a precise decision-making process for these people. They make decisions based on what they love and they do only the things that they are passionate about. They play only characters that they can’t stop thinking about.\n\nIf I got a script that I thought was OK and a character that I kind of liked and could pull off but wasn’t obsessed with, that would be unfair to someone else who might be obsessed with that character. So if I do a movie, you will know I cannot think of anything other than that character. I’m such a fan of great writing and great storytelling. I’m looking for great, powerful writing behind whatever cast is surrounding it, whatever director is steering it—that would all be peripheral to the fact that the story is brilliant and has to be told.\n\nWho among today’s actors do you look up to?\n\nJennifer Lawrence is my favorite, and Emma Stone is one of my best friends. We’ve been best friends since we were 17.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis is so impressive, but I also love how, when Will Smith does something, everyone stands at attention. He’s made such brilliant decisions. He’s so charismatic.\n\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\nHave you taken acting lessons?\n\n\nI actually started out in theater. When I was growing up in Pennsylvania, auditioning for Broadway was my dream. I went to several auditions in New York. I was always going there for vocal and acting lessons…and for auditions, where you stand in line in a long hallway with a lot of people. (I’ve always been freakishly tall, like a giant.)\n\nAfter a few years of auditioning in New York and not getting anything, I started writing songs. But I never lost my love for theater.\n\nI’ve had an acting coach for a few years. I like getting to do things like host “Saturday Night Live.” I had a tiny part in “Valentine’s Day” where Taylor Lautner and I got to ad lib this entire scene. We got to make up our characters and everything, which was really fun. And I just feel so lucky to have been a part of “Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax” because it’s interesting getting to do voice work.\n\nCan you talk about your seemingly easy rise to success?\n\nI grew up on a Christmas tree farm. I put my first album out when I was 16. I’m 22 now. I had been writing songs since I was 12. That was when I discovered that that was what I loved doing more than anything in the world, and I’d be so lucky if I got to do that all my life. So it was a series of begging and pleading and just annoying my parents to the point where they finally moved the family to Nashville.\n\nI got a job as a songwriter in a publishing company there. There’s a lot of songwriting in Nasville, unlike in any other town. You have an office and you set up writing appointments every day. That was my first job.\n\nI was 14 at the time. I would go to school during the day and then write songs at night. It was kind of like having a double life. Eventually, going through meeting after meeting, doing showcase after showcase, I got a record deal with a tiny indie record label. I got to write all the songs on my record and then put out my first album in 2006. I went on a radio tour, where you go from door to door of radio stations and ask them to play your music. This was all on country radio.\n\nThe next record I made was when I was 17. I wrote a song sitting on my bedroom floor called “Love Story” that we put out as the first single and it ended up being No. 1 all over the world. That was my first song that ever went on pop radio, so that was kind of the breakout album. That was also the one that ended up being the Grammy album of the year.\n\nWhat kind of interaction do you have with your fans? Any strange encounters?\n\nYeah, it gets a little strange sometimes, but it’s amazing. The passion level is so wonderful. When I look out at a crowd of people, and sometimes we were lucky enough to play stadiums on our recent tour, it was an overwhelming experience because you’re looking out at 60,000 people. They all have ticket stubs in their pockets with your name on it. It’s a crazy feeling but then you look out and like a lot of people are crying, weeping, especially on the world tour…It was such an amazing experience, being in countries where they don’t speak English as primary language and they’re crying…and they know all the words.\n\nThe world tour was one of my favorite things about this past year, but I’ve noticed a lot more  reaction that sometimes when I run into fans in public, they’ll start crying. It’s so sweet. It used to start off going, “Omigod, let’s get a picture.” Now they just make weeping sounds which is really very sweet and I love it. I think it’s endearing.\n\nWhat is it like when you, Emma Stone, and your other friends get together?\n\nI cook and Emma bakes. Those are our specialties. We just talk about our lives. That’s how I feel when I’m with friends that I’ve had for years. Those are the people that I can just rant to. These are the people who know me the best. It’s crazy with all of my friends having such busy schedules and me always being gone. When you do see your friends, you value the time with them.\n\nCan you talk about your first love?\n\nOmigosh, it’s so hard because I’ve considered three different people (as my first love).\n\nI dated a guy in high school for a while and I think that was, in a way, first love-ish. But then there’s the first time that you love someone more than you’ve ever loved anything, ever. That’s a different thing. Then there’s the time after that where you feel like you’ve loved a man more than anyone you ever loved in your life and that must be your first love because that must be the only time you’ve ever felt that kind of love. I think your life is full of first loves because every time you love someone new, you love them in a different way.\n\n\nWhen you meet someone that you’re attracted to, do you go, “Here’s a song”?\n\n\nThat can happen. I get inspired by the smallest or the biggest things. You meet someone and you wonder if you’ll ever see them again. I could write so many songs about that. I have written so many songs about that. Wait till you hear my next record, it’s all about that.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift 'Absolutely Traumatized' By Justin Bieber's 'Punk'd'\nSinger rules out revenge on Justin after he made her believe she had ruined a couple's wedding day.\nBy Jocelyn Vena\nApril 9, 2012 9:03 PM\n\nOn the season premiere of  \"Punk'd\" on March 29th, Justin Bieber had some fun pulling pranks on his pals Sean Kingston, Rob Dyrdek, Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift.\n\nSwift's punk was particularly memorable, as the singer was left in tears after Bieber made her believe she ruined a wedding. The premise: Bieber and his pal, Ryan Good, talked her into launching off a special firecracker that was sent to them. That firecracker launched off farther than they could have expected and set a boat on fire. That boat had a wedding party on it. And, Swift believed she ruined a couple's big day. Of course, she hadn't.\n\nWhen CMT Insider asked if she would ever get back at him by, say, flour-bombing, she replied, \"No, I'm not gonna do that to somebody! I love Justin. I would never do that to him and I'm not really that girl that's like, 'I'm gonna get him! I'm gonna get him back!' ... cause he's too smart. I'd never be able to punk him. Like, he'd figure it out, then turn the tables on me and then it would be Justin: two, Taylor: zero.\"\n\nAll eyes were on Swift throughout the specially designed prank, eyes that she later learned included the youngest members of the First Family when she caught up with Sasha and Malia at the Kids' Choice Awards. \"They told me they saw the 'Punk'd' episode, so now I know they've seen me absolutely traumatized and terrified, so that was good.\"",

At Bonnaroo this weekend, Foster sat down with Fuse and explained that they actually met up to work on a song together.\n\n\"It's a really cool song, you know?\" said Foster during their interview. \"We kind of just went into it casually, like let's just jam and just have fun, and something really cool came out of it.\"\n\nIt isn't yet known if and when the song will be released, but it's clear that they enjoy working with each other. \"It was a lot of fun working with her; she's super talented,\" remarked Foster.

      "Transcript/Content": "After claiming writing credits for her entire 'Speak Now' album, Taylor Swift seems to be taking a completely different creative approach to her next studio album. The country superstar has added Foster the People's Mark Foster to her long list of collaborators, recently penning a tune with the punk band frontman and rumored love interest. The new pairing is one of many confirmed creative partnerships for the upcoming release.\n\nIn an interview with Fuse during Tennessee's famed Bonnaroo concert festival, Foster spoke about the the new tune, solidifying the pair's work together. \"It’s a really cool song, you know?”  says the singer. “We kind of just went into it casually, like let’s just jam and just have fun, and something really cool came out of it.”\n\n\"It was a lot of fun working with her. She’s super talented,” remarks Foster. \"We'll what happens with it.\" With no official track listing for the album -- expected to be released later this year -- it remains to be seen whether the new songwriting team's track will be included on the upcoming project or a future one.\n\nSpeaking on her new album, Swift says, \"Being so busy, there’s not a lot of time to stop in the middle of the day and just kind of think about this feeling that you just realized about a relationship you had a year ago,” Swift reveals. “The ones I love the most end up happening very quickly.” The 'Safe & Sound' singer admits the new album will be full of \"sad\" songs.\n\nFoster joins a list of eclectic Swift collaborators, which includes British rocker Ed Sheeran, producers Butch Walker (P!nk) and Dan Wilson (Adele) and singer-songwriter Lori McKenna. Nathan Chapman -- the producer responsible for her first three multi-platinum album -- will also help Swift craft her newest project. No specific release dates have been announced.\n\nRead More: Taylor Swift Pens Tune With Foster the People Frontman Mark Foster | https://tasteofcountry.com/taylor-swift-mark-foster-the-people-song/?utm_source=tsmclip&utm_medium=referral",

      "Transcript/Content": "[From Taylor Swift: The Rise Of The Nashville Teen] One of her many admirers was Blu Sanders, a local songwriter who - taking a proactive approach - propelled himself to the front of the queue. \"She was writing with someone else and I stuck my head in the room and told her I wanted to write with her,\" Blue revealed to the author of that first meeting. \"In songwriting, everyone's looking for someone young and good to latch on to in hope that they do well and you can be part of it as it grows. Taylor was writing around town, so people knew about her and that she had something happening.\"\n\nBy the time they first started working together, Taylor hadn't even reached her 15th birthday. However, her reputation was already beginning to precede her. Blu had high expectations - in fact, she had him feeling \"intimidated\" by her lyrical prowess from the first verse.\n\n\"If I Remember correctly, she came in with the first couple lines which I thought were some pretty heavy lyrics for a 14-year old,\" Blu recalled incredulously. \"I was a bit intimidated, frankly. Guy in mid-thirties with confident teenage co-writer. People like to bash young, successful artists. Attribute it to their label, marketing, the target market, but Taylor was the real deal. I know first-hand that the girl at a young age, before her first record ever came out, was more driven and focused that I've probably ever been. When I was 15, I was kicking the soccer ball around, not writing songs!\"\n\nDespite their differences in age, they soon found a winning formula with which to work together. Taylor offered the first few lyrics of the track, while Blu began to experiment with some alternative tunings and the pair also collaborated on suitable melodies, until eventually the framework of a song came together.\n\nHowever, Taylor knew what she wanted in some regards from the outset. \"I remember throwing chorus ideas to her and she was certainly not afraid to say no to things she didn't like,\" Blu explained.\n\nWhen the track took shape, it was called 'Is This Really Happening?' and it became an ode to a love affair that seemed almost too good to be true. \"It's about being in a relationship or a moment with someone and it's amazing and you sort of have to pinch yourself and wonder if it could be as good as it seems,\" he added. However, while Blue connected instantly to her as a writer, he wasn't so sure how to relate the teenage optimism that flowed through her work. \"The challenge in writing with someone else is making [the lyrics] mean something to two different people with completely different lives,\" he revealed. \"I'm a jaded 30-something. If I had to guess, I'd say a teenager has more of those moments than I do. Maybe I need to rethink my approach!\"\n\nDespite spending several hours on the track, it was never recorded in the studio with a band - instead it seemed destined to remain an acoustic demo forever. The irony was that, just like the song Taylor had been picturing, the love affair was more of a fantasy than a reality and never really got off the ground.\n\n\"I still think the song stands up on its own,\" Blu declared. \"I love the lyrics and I love the melody and I actually thought it was going to make her first album. But then I'd be [speaking to you] from my beach house, instead of my brother's air mattress, if it did.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Exclusive: Taylor Swift Spills Makeup Secrets & Previews Her New CG Ad\nMegan McIntyre\nJuly 9, 2012, 9:20 PM\n\nWhen Taylor Swift first emerged on the scene, we got a glimpse of a fiercely talented star with a sweet and girly style that showcased her teen queen status. But as Taylor has grown and matured before our eyes, we've seen a total transformation from the gifted singer-songwriter. In the last year, the golden girl of country has slowly morphed into a burgeoning fashion maven, trying on some very cool new styles that venture outside of her normal aesthetic of sparkly gowns, swinging curls, and romantic makeup.\nPlaying up this new attitude, Taylor's latest CoverGirl commercial has her trying on a plethora of personas, from boho babe to edgy rockstar. We've got your exclusive first look at the new ad and a behind-the-scenes chat with Taylor as she plays dress up on set. We also scored a Q&A with the sweet-as-pie star, and delved into everything from her thoughts on the evolution of her look and what it was like to shoot that Vogue cover to why you really should avoid using Sharpie as eyeliner. She may have started out all cute and sweet, but we're discovering there's a bit of an edge to Swift, and that's only making us fall more in love with her.\n\nYour style has evolved a lot over the years. How would you describe your current look, in three words?\n\"I think that happens naturally over time, since it's always fun to try out new styles. In three words: classic, feminine, and retro.\"\n\nWho and what have been the biggest influences on your off-duty style, over the past year?\n\"I love looking at photos of Ethel and Jackie Kennedy back in the '50s and '60s. Something about that elegance is really lovely and makes me want to dress more like they did. I'd never thought about wearing pearl earrings or head scarves before [being inspired by] them.\"\n\nSpeaking of style evolution, you've really transformed into a sophisticated, style-savvy woman over the past few years. The culmination of that obviously being your Vogue cover. How did you feel about those pictures?\n\"Seeing my Vogue cover for the first time was a moment I'll never forget. It was a dream come true to be a part of such an incredible shoot. I loved the vintage inspiration and the fact that they let me pose with my instruments and my band for the inside shots. I was so excited to be shooting the cover of Vogue that I let them cut bangs for me at the shoot. It turned out to be one of my favorite changes I've ever made to my hair. Moral of the story: Always trust Vogue.\n\nWhat's the process that goes through your head when you decide between curly and straight hair? It's so stunning both ways!\n\"I decide based on what I'm doing on any given day. Lately, I've been doing my hair in a way that's sort of a combination of the two, smooth on top with a loose curl at the bottom. My go-to easy hairstyle at the moment is a ponytail with some kind of headband or scarf.\"\n\nThis CoverGirl commercial is all about transforming your look — which was your favorite look of the variety that you took on, here?\n\"I really like changing my look around. My hair and make up really determine how I look, and we played around with so many cool looks on the shoot. I really liked the natural one the most, though.\"\n\nWhat's the coolest beauty look you've ever tried?\n\"My favorite looks to try out are the ones I end up sticking with. I love red lips and a cat-eye. That's been my go to for a few years now.\"\n\nWhat's the craziest beauty trick you've ever tried?\n\"I once used a Sharpie as eyeliner in an airplane bathroom because I didn't have any with me. I don't recommend it.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] 'Music Is Everything That I Am'\n\nSpeaking her mind with her lyrics hasn't done\nTAYLOR SWIFT any harm. She's dating a Kennedy and is the world's richest young celebrity, leaving even Rihanna and Gaga trailing behind.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS BY DAVID ROEMER. STYLING BY JAYNE PICKERING WORDS BY TONY HORKINS\n\nTaylor Swift is feeling the burn. With a new album on the horizon and a promotional schedule to rival that of a presidential nominee, she thought she'd prepare with a little extended time in the gym. But while she's been busy eyeling to nowhere, strutting her stuff on the cross-trainer and working extra hard on those abs, her body has said a big thank you by delivering a cough. The result? A pain like a sashimi knife through the ribs with every convulsion.\nI thought that if I don't get my stamina up, I'd just be passing out from exhaustion, she says mid hack, holding her torso tightly as if it were about to split open from the pain. 'Working out is hard and I don't like it, but I do it because I am about ready to go crazy promoting stuff, flying all over the world. But, she splutters again, \"the pain!\"\nTaylor has brought her 'no pain no gain' attitude to NYC, flying in from her native Nashville for a day of primping, pouting and posing for Marie Claire. After the shoot, she's slipped into her own clothes-polka-dot, slim-fit J Brand jeans, Pretty Ballerinas gold flats, Helmut Lang white linen shirt, light Gorman sweater and a blue polka-dot headhand she picked up from Urban Outfitters for less than a tenner. The look is all very late 50s/early 60s modern gal on the go I'm obsessed with it right now,\" she says. \"I can't get enough of going to vintage shops and buying dresses.\"\nNot that she's going to have much time for that over the next... well, who knows-50 years? Swift is in it for the long haul. A singing, writing smiling, hit-making machine, her outrageously successful career since releasing her 2006 eponymous debut album at just 16 years old has smashed multiple records and won her more than 100 awards worldwide, including an impressive six Grammys.\nThe week before we meet she hits another milestone: being named by Forbes magazine as the highest-paid celebrity under the age of 30, beating the musical heavyweights that are Bieber, Gaga, Rihanna and Perry and pulling in a wallet-straining 857 million in a single year of work. That's a pretty impressive day rate.\n\"Yes, I heard about that and I think. I called my dad and said, \"How did that happen? she says. \"I just wake up every day and go about my life and do what's on the schedule. I don't think in terms of how much money it's making. 1 just knew the crowds were getting bigger and the shows were selling out faster. For something like that to come out is certainly unexpected and nice.\"\n\nWhile most may feel a $57 million pay day to be a little more than 'nice\", Swift has never been motivated by the cash, despite attracting it by the shedload. Instead, as a pre-teen living in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania- famous for being the home of American commercial giants like Toys R Us and Old Navy she had her sights set on Nashville, the hub of country music giants such as The Dixie Chicks, Shania Twain and Faith Hill.\nWhile the young Swift may not have been the first American schoolgirl to dream of life as a country singer, she may be the first to have convinced her parents to move across the country and relocate to Nashville to pursue her aspirations. At just 14 years old, most of us were barely able to convince our parents to let us stay up late, let alone ap roots and move across the country I know she agrees, smiling at the memory. I was just constant, non-stop annoying, perpetually bringing it up. At this point I'd been playing shows every weekend, and then most nights in coffee houses, and my parents saw that I was so obsessed, that I wasn't going to drop it, that it wasn't some adolescent phase.\" On one of their regular trips to the southern state, Swift's mother found a house on a lake and, knowing her husband had a penchant for boats, she finally managed to convince him to make the move. They were far removed from the classic showbiz parents: mother Andrea was a stay-at-home mum, her father Scott a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch. Now, Swift says, they're very involved.\n\"My parents were thrown into this they never had any desire for me to do music,\" she says, 'itut now my dad tells me what to invest in and what not to, and my mum has a great marketing mind she always has a good gut instinct on things.\n\nBrother Austin, who at 20 is two years her junior, is also involved in the family business: while studying at college he works freelance as a photographer for Getty Images. Some of his Taylor pics have appeared in People and Rolling Stone magazines.\nThe instinct to make the big move turned out to be a wise one for the whole family: shortly after hitting Nashville -and still only 14 years old-Taylor got a job at Sony Publishing as a songwriter.\nI would go to school during the day and then Mum would pick me up and I'd go and write songs at Sony in this office after school, she says. It really taught me about songwriting.\"\n\nIt's been Swift's songwriting that's really got her noticed, and in more than a little trouble too. Her three albums-and her soon-to-be-released fourth, Red -are spilling over with pre-and post-teen confessionals, occasionally naming names and always casting blame. With a love life that's like a roll call of young Hollywood-exes include Joe Jonas she wrote Better Than Revenge about his ex girlfriend, Camilla Belle). Taylor Lautner Rack To December is suspected to be about him and is written as something of an apology), Jake Gyllenhaal (who broke up with her over the phone and may have had the song Mean penned about him) and John Mayer her Deur fohn track apparently 'humiliated the singer and guitarist) she's entirely unapologetic about turning her experiences into verses and choruses.\n\nShe also went on to write about the incident with Kanye West. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards the rapper stormed the stage as she was accepting her award for best video, stealing her shining moment by shouting, 'But Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!\" into the mic while Taylor was trying to thank her fans. It became a national news story, with even President Obama chiming in to call West 'a jackass. Taylor got her revenge in the song Innocent; on the CD's lyric sheet, where Swift always puts coded messages in capital letters, the letters spell out life is full of little interruptions\".\nMeanwhile, her most recent single which broke Lady Gaga's record to become the fastest single to reach number one on iTunes ever- has the brutally illustrative title of Together (which includes the rather abulous lyric, And you will hide away nd find your peace of mind with some nidie record that's much cooler than mine). Does she issue a warning at the beginning of a relationship, something ke: just beware that if you piss me off, twill be used in a song against you?\n\"Ha!l Well it's not like it's in fine print,\" she grins, \"but music is absolutely everything that I am and everything that I stand for. It's not my fault if someone gets into a relationship with me and then cheats and I write a song about it.\"\n\nUnapologetic, she's most recently been seen at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port on the arm of Conor Kennedy, grandson of the late Robert Kennedy and part of a family that's the closest America has to royalty. Despite the age difference at 18 years old Conor is Sour years her junior and still at boarding school-Taylor seems to be throwing herself into the relationship, and has even been rumoured to have purchased $5 million mansion next to the Kennedy family estate (now that's smitten).\n\nWhat's more, the love-in between Swift and the usually private Kennedys seems mutual: Conor's grandmother Ethel says the family would be \"lucky' to have Swift as a future family member, while the singer herself says the only time she's been star struck was when she first met Ethel.\nRegardless of her standing in America's original First Family (you've got to admit \"Taylor Kennedy has a sort of ring to it) she says that love is something I've always been fascinated by, ever since I was a little kid\". And despite the well-documented failures, both in the press and on her records, she still loves the idea of love.\nEven after it explodes into a million pieces and burns down and you're standing in a pile of the ash of what it once was thinking, \"Why did I have to meet this person, why did this have to happen? she says, momentarily pausing for breath. 'But then, when you make eye contact with someone across the room and it clicks and, bam, you're there. In love again.\"\nDoes she fall in love easily?\n'Not if it's the wrong person, yes if it's the right person,\" she says after an extended pause.\nShe says her experiences both good and bad have taught her plenty, and that she now knows when to walk away and how to be a better person in the process. Which begs the question: why, having been burned by high-profile types who virtually scream 'this a bad idea' does she keep inviting trouble and dipping back into that dating pool? After all, these are not people known for having an interest in the meaningful, long-term relationships she craves.\nI agree with everything you're saying she says slowly, a smile creeping over her face. I think I have to trust that you end up with the person you're supposed to end up with, and that everything in between is there to teach you stuff. Plus it makes for great stories when you're older The way things are going for Taylor Swift, she'll be able to write a whole anthology of stories by the time she hits her thirties. She's got no plans to stop this train rolling, but she does have her sights set on a life beyond the globetrotting. She may have blown. some of that hard-carned cash on a house, a condo and a car, but the rest is earmarked for a more settled future.\nThat money will be really good for sending my kids to college some day-or maybe I'll have a few more kids than I thought,' she muses. \"I want a bunch of them running around, minimum four. I want to wait a while, but... the idea of pouring everything you are into another person when you become a parent has always been amazing to me.\nShe says that a lot of the choices she makes are ultimately for what her kids. would think one day.\nThat factors into everything 1 do,' she says. \"They're going to have computers and they're going to be able to read what I said in this interview.\nShe's right there: Taylor's digital footprint has enormous reach. She's been using her MySpace, Twitter and Facebook accounts to communicate with her fans from the beginning of her career, and insists that she does all the updates herself. 'What else am I doing when I wake up early?\" she says. The attention to detail is paying off she currently has around 34 million Facebook 'likes', her Twitter feed has nearly 18 million followers and her MySpace page has had a staggering 120 million views. All followers are treated to daily updates and insights into the minutiae of her life. All of which makes Taylor Swift one very busy pop star, a star with one wish left to fulfil: to stop over-analysingand just to enjoy. She says she's already spent way too much time thinking too hard about what others think of her, and she's decided it's time to stop. At some point you have to snap yourself out of it and go, \"You know what? Right now your level of insecurity is bordering on vain. Stop it.\" That's when I stop myself and go, \"Everything's fine, your family's healthy, life is good.\"\nRed will be released on 22 October.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift has written the next chapter of her \"Love Story,\" and she means business.\n\nThe six-time Grammy winner debuted the name and cover of her brand-new album, \"Red,\" which will be out on Oct. 22, and premiered the album's first single, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" during a live Webcast today in Nashville, taking fan questions in real time afterwards. Aug. 13 was an apt choice for the announcement date because 13 is the Swift's lucky number and over 72,500 viewers tuned in.\nSwift said she decided to use the title \"Red\" because \"it was really simple\" and epitomized the different emotions she experienced in the crazy, \"semi-toxic\" relationships she's had in the past two years, and \"there's nothing beige about that.\" The singer also revealed that she wrote \"30 to 35? songs for the album and but whiddled it down to 16 tracks, which includes a duet with recording artist Ed Sheeran.\n\n\"I am so excited for you to hear the new direction of things,\" Swift said, adding that \"really disfunctional\" and \"not good\" relationships can provide \"a lot of inspiration.\"\n\nHer new song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" which is about ending a bad relationship, is out today on iTunes and GooglePlay. While at a shoot for Glamour magazine, the 22-year-old singer told \"Nightline\" anchor Cynthia McFadden exclusively that the song was about something that actually happened to her.\n\nTune into \"Good Morning America\" October 22nd and 23rd to watch Taylor Swift's first live concert of her brand-new album, \"Red.\"\n\n\"Writing 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together' was one of the most hilarious experiences I have ever had in the studio because it just happened so naturally,\" Swift told McFadden.\n\nSwift said the song was born while she was in the studio with songwriters Max Martin and Johan Shellback and a friend of her ex's - she declined to name names - walked in.\n\n\"He starts talking about how he's heard we were getting back together and that was not the case,\" Swift said. \"When he leaves, Max and Johan are like, 'so what's the story behind that?' And so I start telling them the story of break up, get back together, break up, get back together, just, ugh, the worst.\"\n\n\"Max says, 'this is what we're writing. We're writing this song,' and I picked up the guitar and just started singing, 'we are never-'\" she continued. \"It just happened so fast. It was so much fun.\"\n\nSwift, who is one of the most successful country-pop crossover artists ever and has over 17 million Twitter followers, has made a career out of turning feelings of heartache and longing into smash hit singles, including \"Love Story,\" \"Sparks Fly\" and \"You Belong With Me.\"\n\nRed will be the singer's fourth studio album. Swift's previous 2010 album, \"Speak Now,\" won her two Grammys and sold over one million copies in its first week.\n\nThe rest of McFadden's interview with Taylor Swift will come later this fall in a Glamour profile as well as on \"Good Morning America\" and \"Nightline.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift in Wonderland\nThe reckless heart, restless nights and lovable quirks of pop's unstoppable princess\n\nBY BRIAN HIATT - OCTOBER 25, 2012\n\nThis is what it sounds like when Taylor Swift totally loses it: “Oh, my God. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.”\n\nHer summer tan is turning ashen; her very blue eyes are practically pinwheeling with panic. But she didn’t do anything that bad just now, didn’t start a nuclear war or curse on country radio or upload her new album to BitTorrent: We’re on a bleak industrial road outside a Nashville rehearsal studio one stiflingly hot late-August evening, with Swift behind the wheel of her black Toyota SUV – which she just backed directly into a parked car.\n\nShe’s never learned how to use her SUV’s built-in GPS, was messing with Yelp and Google Maps on her iPhone instead, realized she was going the wrong way, started to turn around, still clutching the phone, and . . . crunch.\n\n“Oh, my God,” she repeats, pausing for air. She takes another look at the car she hit. “Oh, is that my bass player?”\n\nIt totally is. “It’s fine, it’s my bass player!” She couldn’t look more relieved if she had received a death-row pardon. Popping out of the SUV, she apologizes to her bemused employee, a Ben Stiller look-alike named Amos Heller, who had been walking toward his now slightly dented car. “I’m gonna pay for it, I promise! I’m good for it! Oh, my God, Amos, I’m so sorry. I freaked out ’cause I went the wrong way and he was gonna think I’m a bad driver and then I backed into another car. This is the worst interview he’s ever had, already!”\n\nInside Taylor Swift’s ‘Rolling Stone’ Cover Shoot\n\nOne of her security guys, who was supposed to be discreetly trailing us, gets out of his own SUV, looking shaken: “You OK?” Soon enough, we resume our journey to a local restaurant, this time with Swift following her bodyguard, who’s serving as a human GPS at her behest. Problem solved.\n\nSwift is still recovering for the whole 10-minute drive. “I cannot believe there was a car behind me. I thought that – because I could only see the security car, and Amos’ car was so low and I didn’t look in the back camera and I was so sure no one was behind me and . . .”\n\nThe moment she crashed, she pictured herself being taken away in handcuffs, sitting in jail in her blue polka-dot shirt-dress. “I have a lot of anxieties that end in me being put into a police car,” she says, ponytail bopping as she shakes her head. “I am so, like, rules, and not getting into accidents. So this is perfect.”\n\nAt 22, Swift is always waiting for her luck to run out. This week, her new single, the irresistible, distinctly un-country “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” became her first Number One Hot 100 hit – and for all she knows, it could all be downhill from here. “I’m always terrified that, like, something’s going to happen,” she says, “and I’m not going to be able to do this anymore and it’s gonna all end in one day. Part of the fear comes from loving this so much and not wanting to lose it.”\n\nWatch her segment of MTV’s Punk’d, where Justin Bieber goads Swift into setting off fireworks from a waterfront balcony – then makes her think that they started a huge fire on a nearby boat: Her face betrays the same ohmygodohmygod terror. “You know I had serious nightmares where I’d wake up in the middle of the night for, like, three weeks after that? I really thought that was it for me. I was thinking, ‘Justin is 17, so he’s going to juvie, but I’m going to big-girl prison.’ ”\n\nShe nearly made it all into a self-fulfilling prophecy during her performance at the 2010 Grammys, when stage fright knocked her voice flat during an awkward duet with Stevie Nicks on “Rhiannon.” Nonfans were instantly, and unfairly, convinced that she was an AutoTune baby who can’t sing live. “I had a bad night,” says Swift, who’s since refocused on vocal lessons. “It’s one of those things where you’ve rehearsed over and over and when the camera turns on, the nerves kick in and you just can’t think straight.”\n\nMostly, though, it’s been a smooth ride, with so few speed bumps she could practically tick them off on crimson-tipped fingers: She was terrible at fourth-grade soccer, couldn’t parlay her height into basketball glory, never managed to do a split, had a hard time with math. There were some mean middle school girls, and more recently, as you may have heard, a few totally exhausting boyfriends. She has that slight overbite; at five feet 11, her posture isn’t great. And yeah, there was that time Kanye West snatched her microphone and started yelling stuff about Beyoncé – still not funny, as far she’s concerned.\n\nBut she’s come to understand that life – even hers – is unpredictable, uncontrollable. Messy. The Kanye episode helped her to “realize nothing is gonna go exactly the way that you plan it to,” she says. “Just because you make a good plan, doesn’t mean that’s what’s gonna happen.”\n\nCase in point: Later that evening, Swift is driving back from dinner, singing along to Third Eye Blind’s “Never Let You Go” (which came out when she was nine) – when, unbelievably, we get into another car accident.\n\nThis one is random, terrifying and utterly not her fault. As Swift cruises down a four-lane street, what looks like an old Corvette blazes out of an intersection and veers into our lane – smacking the driver’s side of Swift’s SUV, then speeding off. They were driving, as Swift later puts it, like they had just robbed a bank.\n\n“OK, that was my life flashing before my eyes,” she says, voice trembling. “What is this day? This is some strange alternate reality where things just go wrong a lot. That was the second time today! I’m going to have a nervous breakdown!” Her phone rings – it’s her poor security bro, who sounds like he’s already had one.\n\nThere is a pond, complete with koi fish, in the middle of Swift’s astonishing, many-colored Nashville condo. It sits beneath a wrought-metal spiral staircase leading to a human-size birdcage that faces floor-to-ceiling windows, with a view stretching to the green mountains beyond downtown. (“It’s the most comfortable place in the world,” she says of the wooden cage, built from a sketch she made. “It’s just, like, pillows and comfiness.”)\n\nUnder the previous owner, this was an ultramodern bachelor pad. Over 18 months of remodeling, Swift gave the condo a heavy dose of well-funded OCD whimsy. The ceiling is arranged in multiple motifs – billowing curtains here, a painted indigo night sky there. In one corner, under hanging crystalline stars, sits a giant bunny made of moss. He’s wearing a hat. “It’s a whole Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland structure here,” she says, welcoming me the next morning. “It’s what the inside of my brain looks like, essentially.”\n\nOn the custom-built walls – some brick, some purple-wallpapered – are an endless array of photographs in ornate gold frames, some with matching gold-cursive captions: Swift with her high school friend Abigail (complete with lyrics from “Fifteen,” in which said friend gave a boy “everything she had”); Swift with James Taylor; Swift making that heart-hand-symbol thing with buddy Selena Gomez. Above the fireplace, which is emblazoned with a small heart, there’s even a photo of the moment Kanye stormed her VMA stage (captioned, “Life is full of little interruptions,” a phrase that’s also in the liner notes of her last album), right next to what is presumably the actual award in question under glass.\n\nThe place is immaculate, and there’s no sign that any other living thing – besides her unusually friendly Scottish fold cat, Meredith (named after a favorite Grey’s Anatomy character) – has been here recently. But a gossip item circulating that morning suggests otherwise: As the story goes, she missed her boyfriend, 18-year-old Conor Kennedy – an incoming prep-school senior – so she “kidnapped” him, via private jet, flying him to Nashville.\n\nSwift stopped reading her own press after the Grammy incident, and instituted a self-Googling ban. “What did I do? Don’t tell me! Is it bad?” she says, clutching a pale-blue knitted pillow and curling her mile-long legs beneath her on a swiveling love seat. She’s barefoot, wearing a V-neck white blouse and high-waisted, vintage-y floral shorts. Her knees have some fresh white scars on them (“I fell on rocks on the beach, and I fell during volleyball. Kind of eight-year-old-child injuries”). When she hears the day’s gossip, her eyes widen under feline makeup. She looks faintly nauseated: “How did I kidnap him? You can’t kidnap a grown man! These are serious accusations, now!”\n\nShe laughs, but she’s swiveling furiously in the chair, like it might move her away from this topic. “It’s an interesting way to spin something into a story,” she says. “See, this is why I don’t read stuff.”\n\nSo is Conor chained to something upstairs, then? “What? God!”\n\nShe is aware of another recent rumor: that she and Kennedy crashed his cousin’s wedding, then flatly refused to leave. “I have no idea what happened there,” she says, spinning again, fidgeting with some chipped nail polish on her index finger. “I think that story was based on the biggest misunderstanding, ’cause I would never knowingly show up somewhere that I thought I wasn’t invited to. And I would never want to upstage anybody.”\n\nShe’s come to grips, sort of, with the fact that her days of exclusively good press are over. “I just gotta take it day by day,” she says. “I don’t think anyone is ever truly viewed as only one thing, as only good, as only well-behaved, as only respectful. In the beginning, when there would be a tiny news story about something that wasn’t true, I thought that meant my fans weren’t gonna show up to my next concert. But now, knock on wood – where’s wood? I need to knock on wood – I feel like my fans have my back and I have theirs.”\n\nAnd she knows that she can’t always be the good guy. “It’s just part of the dynamics of a good story,” she says. “Everybody is a complicated character.”\n\nIt’s somehow not surprising to learn that Swift had her first drink ever on her 21st birthday. “I knew I couldn’t get away with it until then,” she says the night before, sipping a Diet Coke through a little red straw that matches her lipstick. We made it into the restaurant without fuss, except for a pigtailed little girl who gaped with I-just-saw-the-Easter-Bunny joy. “I didn’t really care to know what I was missing, and I knew it was illegal, and that my luck would be that I’d get caught. And then you think about all the moms and little girls who would have thought less of me. I’m still not much of a drinker, but I’ll have a glass of wine every once in a while.” And has she gotten drunk? “I’m not gonna talk about that! No one wants to picture that!”\n\nIt can’t be easy, living like this. Gomez recalls going out to dinner with Swift when she noticed another patron eavesdropping. “She got startled that they were listening,” Gomez says, “and she got nervous, and then the person left and she felt awful. She was like, ‘I hope he didn’t leave because of me. I hope he doesn’t think I’m mean. Do you think he’s going to tell everyone I’m mean?’ She cares so much.”\n\nSwift has recurring anxiety dreams, and, predictably enough, one of them involves being arrested for something she didn’t do. “I keep trying to tell them that I didn’t do anything,” she says, “and they won’t listen, or my voice doesn’t work.”\n\nAnother one is quite vivid. “I’ll be in a room with piles of clothes all over the floor, and I can’t clean it. And no matter what, they keep piling up and I can’t move. It freaks me out! It makes me wish I could clean it, ’cause I love cleaning. But the piles get bigger, or there’s piles on the ceiling, and I don’t even know how that’s possible.”\n\nShe knows what that one’s about. “I think I have a big fear of things spiraling out of control,” she says. “Out of control and dangerous and reckless and thoughtless scares me, because people get hurt. When you say ‘control freak’ and ‘OCD’ and ‘organized,’ that suggests someone who’s cold in nature, and I’m just not. Like, I’m really open when it comes to letting people in. But I just like my house to be neat, and I don’t like to make big messes that would hurt people. . . . I don’t want to let people down, or let myself down, or have a lot of people that I know I wronged.”\n\nSwift has never seen a therapist. “I just feel very sane,” she says.\n\nIt takes only a cursory listen to Swift’s songs – or a visit to TMZ – to figure out the one part of her life where she allows messiness to reign. “The way I look at love is you have to follow it,” she says, “and fall hard, if you fall hard. You have to forget about what everyone else thinks. It has to be an us-against-the-world mentality. You have to make it work by prioritizing it, and by falling in love really fast, without thinking too hard. If I think too hard about a relationship I’ll talk myself out of it.”\n\nAnd why would she go from dating men in their 30s – John Mayer, Jake Gyllenhaal – to her current, SAT-prepping guy? “I have rules for a lot of areas of my life,” she says. “Love is not going to be one of them.”\n\nBefore she got together with Conor, she was publicly touting her interest in the Kennedy family’s history, and had mentioned reading a 960-page book called The Kennedy Women. “Weird,” she says. “Oh, my God, I know. It’s like – things happen in my life in coincidental ways that are weird.”\n\nBut it does look funny. . . . ”You’re telling me,” she says. She looks comically aghast at the idea of Elvis superfan Nicolas Cage marrying Lisa Marie Presley – he got the ultimate collectible. “That’s not what’s happening,” she practically yells, sending her eyes skyward.\n\nIt may also help that a friend did it first. Ask Gomez if Swift got the idea from her relationship with Bieber (who’s almost two years younger), and her answer is quick and cheerful: “Probably!”\n\nSwift has written some of her generation’s most seductively romantic songs – she may be the world’s leading proponent of kissing in the rain. “I love the ending of a movie where two people end up together,” says Swift, who further explores this theme on a new collaboration with Snow Patrol. “Preferably if there’s rain and an airport or running or a confession of love.”\n\nShe’s also written breakup tunes that, in their own way, rival “Idiot Wind” for mercilessness. “Dear John,” 2010’s presumed John Mayer evisceration, may be the most brutal: “Don’t you think nineteen’s too young to be played by your dark, twisted games?” But the new album’s “Trouble” comes close: “You never loved me or her or anyone,” she sings.\n\n“In every one of my relationships,” she says, “I’ve been good and fair. What happens after they take that for granted is not my problem. Chances are if they’re being written about in a way they don’t like, it’s because they hurt me really badly. Telling a story only works if you have characters in it. I don’t think it’s mean. I think it’s mean to hurt someone in a relationship.”\n\nMayer told Rolling Stone that “Dear John” “really humiliated” him, and accused Swift of “cheap songwriting.” When I first try to ask her about that over dinner, she literally presses her hands against her ears, saying, “Be kind, and don’t tell me.”\n\nThe next day, I’m unkind enough to relay Mayer’s quotes, and she turns steely. “I didn’t write his first and last name in the song! So that’s him taking it on – when he had an album to promote.”\n\nBut didn’t she use his first name? “I didn’t say anything about the person’s identity. ‘Dear John’ is a well-known concept.”\n\nAnd why not just pick up the phone and tell these guys off directly? She looks at me like I’m insane. “What’s the fun in that?” (“She’s so tough,” says Gomez. “Sometimes she’ll tell me, like, ‘You should be a little mean sometimes.’ ”)\n\nIn addition to heavy rom-com viewing (Love Actually is her favorite), Swift’s daunting ideal of love comes from her maternal grandparents, who were married for 51 years, and died a week apart. “They were still madly in love with each other in their eighties,” she says.\n\nThere are no mere hookups in Swift-land. “No,” she says, nose wrinkling. “Where’s the romance? Where’s the magic in that? I’m just not that girl.” And by the way, hackers shouldn’t bother with her cellphone: “There’s interesting things on there, like text messages,” she says. “But you wouldn’t find any naked pictures.”\n\nShe’s uncomfortable discussing a line from her new album – “I’ll do anything you say if you say it with your hands” – that seems to break new ground. “I don’t know if I’m interested in writing about, um, blatantly sexual things out of the context of how it affects a relationship,” she says, then pauses. “Oh, I should just totally say that Dan thought of it,” she adds, meaning co-writer Dan Wilson. “I could get myself off the hook so quick!”\n\nSwift loves the idea of long relationships, though she’s never really had one. “It usually lasts four and a half months, and then it all just disintegrates. Then I spend, like, a year and a half mourning the loss of it.”\n\nEventually, she would like to have a lot of kids: “Like, minimum, four,” she says. “My fantasy has always been having a bunch of kids running around. I would love to become as dedicated a mom as my mom was.” Which brings her to another recurring nightmare. “I have a kid and the paparazzi is taking pictures, and it’s scaring my baby. And I know that I caused it, and I can’t figure out how to stop it.”\n\nAfew days later, Swift is sitting in a dressing room in MTV’s New York studio, wearing a fluffy blue bathrobe and borrowed hotel slippers, talking business on her phone. Her two beauty coordinators are ministering to her wavy hair with a flatiron as she speaks. She waves me in, midconversation.\n\n“I resent the idea that you can just start a sentence with ‘respectfully’ and then you can just say whatever you want,” she says, sounding like someone with whom you wouldn’t want to negotiate. “I don’t understand how we resolve this – is it him giving points? Ah, OK, good call. Absolutely, if he calls me I’ll tell him that. OK, cool. Mm-hmm. Yeah, respectfully.” Instead of a manager, Swift has a management team, which she leads herself.\n\nHer parents, Scott and Andrea, both have business backgrounds and have been involved in her career from the start. “I think my earliest memory is my mom would set up an easel in the kitchen when I was three,” says Swift. “And she’d give me finger paints and I’d paint whatever I wanted, and it was always good enough.\n\n“My mom would have conversations with me before I could talk,” she says. “So I started talking really early.” Her first word was ‘yellow,’ which had something to do with fellow tall creature Big Bird.\n\nThe rest is already a familiar story: She grew up on a Christmas-tree farm in rural Pennsylvania, became unaccountably obsessed with Shania Twain and the Dixie Chicks, started singing and writing songs, and by age 14, persuaded her parents to move near Nashville. They signed to a fledgling label called Big Machine Records, founded by a former Universal executive named Scott Borchetta. Swift’s dad, a Merrill Lynch stockbroker, was a minor investor in the label, which was more of an idea than a company when they signed: “Scott Swift owns three percent of Big Machine,” Borchetta says. “But I hear people go, ‘Oh, well, he funded the whole deal, and that’s why Taylor’s Number One.’ It’s like, ‘Please, people.’ Everybody wants to say, ‘Well, there’s a reason.’ Yeah, there is a reason. ‘Cause she’s great. That’s the reason.”\n\nAs she prepares to release her fourth album, Red, Swift is at the very center of pop – more than any other putatively country artist before her. That’s why MTV is sacrificing valuable Teen Mom airtime to debut her new video in a live segment tonight. But first, she has to endure nine or so taped interviews with various network offshoots. Now in a tight red top and blue pants, she displays such ease with a parade of interrogators – and the random little kids who come by for autographs – that it’s not hard to imagine her running for office someday. “Really? I might have to be a college graduate, though,” she says. “I guess I better start figuring out my platform.”\n\nThis ease with glad-handing comes from her father, who, as Borchetta says, “never meets a stranger. You send him into a room, and he’ll walk out and go, ‘Hey, I just met a guy on the board at Papa John’s.’ True to form, when I eventually meet Scott Swift – an affable silver-haired guy in a Brooks Brothers-y suit and rimless glasses – he immediately goes for common ground, sharing tales of a brief stint in journalism.\n\nTaylor’s maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, was a professional opera singer who sang around the world. “I feel like my karma in life is being in a backstage area or being in front of the house,” says Andrea Swift, whose mother died around the time Taylor was signing her record deal. “We were in Nashville when she passed away, and it was a surreal moment, because I knew we were doing what she wanted us to do. There was a kind of passing of the torch.”\n\nSwift is convinced she’s an exact mix of her parents’ personalities – she thinks like her mom but acts like her dad. “My mom is, like, all about the worst-case scenario,” she says. “My brother and I call her Central Intelligence Andrea. If you have a headache, she could tell you 15 different things it could be, all of which end in emergency room or death. But she also knows how to throw the best party. She’s also really compassionate and kind and disciplined and has a really good head on her shoulders for advice.”\n\nHer father is the designated dreamer, though she won’t say if her lyric about “a careless man’s careful daughter” is autobiographical: “My mom thinks of things in terms of reality and my dad always thinks in terms of daydreams – and, ‘How far can we go with this?’ ” He was the one who envisioned her success: “I never really went there in my mind that all of this was possible. It’s just that my dad always did.”\n\nAs Swift waits for her video debut, racing around the room on a wheeled ottoman, network executives Van Toffler and Amy Doyle show up. Many smiles and hugs ensue. “How huge is that single?” says Toffler, who’s wearing jeans and a blazer, his hair slicked back. “It’s like the most ginormous thing in history.”\n\n“It’s the highest female debut in iTunes history,” Swift says. “I’m, like, what?”\n\n“And you know,” says Toffler, “or I don’t know if you do know, but you’re going to be closing the VMAs.”\n\n“Oh, my God,” says Swift. “I’m gonna pass out. What? When were you guys gonna tell me that? Thank you, that’s amazing. Now I really do feel like I might pass out.” She’s happy, but there’s a familiar hint of terror in her eyes. Ohmygod.\n\nAviral video called “Taylor Swift Can’t Believe It” shows Swift winning award after award, acting lottery-winner astonished every time, continually mouthing, “What?” (See Kristen Wiig’s brutal Swift impression.) Needless to say, Swift has never seen it. “I really get my feelings hurt when people make fun of me,” she says. “I never won anything in school or in sports, and then all of a sudden, I started winning things. People always say, ‘Live in the moment’ – if you really live in the moment at a big awards show and you win, you freak out!”\n\n“Those are just her mannerisms,” says one of Swift’s best friends, stylist Ashley Avignone. “She does the same thing if I tell her something on the couch at home.”\n\nThe morning after the VMAs, we meet for breakfast in Beverly Hills – her security sneaks her through the back of the restaurant. Us Weekly‘s headline for the performance was “Taylor Swift Gets Sexy” – because she wore shorts. “It’s a really interesting idea that you wear shorts and all of a sudden it’s very edgy,” she says. “Which, you know, on the bright side gives you room to grow – I don’t have to do too much to shock people.”\n\nIt’s 11 a.m. and she’s totally bright-eyed and un-hung-over in her cream-colored blouse and polka-dot pants (“not shorts,” she says, “that would be too sexy”). She skipped the afterparties and had sushi with her band instead. When she hears that Lady Gaga tweeted, “Swifty is so cute” after her performance, she offers a taste of jaw-drop-awards face: “No way! Are you serious? I need to see that! Thank you for telling me that.” She spends three minutes trying again and again to load the tweet on her phone, without success.\n\nIt would be easy to watch Swift at those awards shows and conclude that she’s a phony – in her terms, a cheerleading captain pretending she still belongs on the bleachers. But if she lacks self-consciousness, that’s the idea. “I just don’t want to live that way,” she says. “I never want to get jaded, because then you get really protective and hard to be around. That’s what can happen if you’re too aware of people second-guessing every move you make. So I try to be as blissfully unaware of that as possible.” She laughs. “Please don’t ruin it. I’m living in such a happy little world!”\n\nSwift may just experience life a little more intensely than the rest of us, which is one reason her songs can hit so hard – along with the ache in her voice, and her instinct for the minor fall and the major lift. Her songs sneak past our emotional defenses because she has so few of them.\n\nSwift has one more thing to do before she leaves L.A. – a performance at a Stand Up to Cancer telethon, broadcast live on more than 20 channels. She has a bunker-buster of a song for the occasion, called “Ronan.” Swift’s eyes grow wet telling me about it: It’s the true story of a not-quite-four-year-old boy who died of cancer, told from the perspective of his mother. (Swift incorporated ideas from the mom’s blog, giving co-songwriting credit.) Nearly every line is unbearably upsetting – it makes “Streets of Philadelphia” sound like “Party Rock Anthem.” (The lyric that keeps getting me: “It’s about to be Halloween/You could be anything you wanted if you were still here.”) Andrea – blond, warm-eyed – passes out tissues as Swift rehearses the song at the Shrine Auditorium. I take one.\n\nAs showtime approaches, Swift keeps her mind off the song, doing her extensive vocal warm-ups (which, at one point, involve actual meows) and discussing food options for tonight’s plane back to Nashville. She’s sprawled sideways in a director’s chair; her flats have cartoon-cat heads by the toes. “Buffalo tenders? OK! And rigatoni with truffle meat sauce – can I get it with spaghetti, though? Rigatoni makes me feel weird. It’s like a wheel, and what’s it trying to do? It’s like an unfinished ravioli.”\n\nSoon, trailed by a small entourage that includes her mom and her stylist, Swift enters the theater’s darkness. She stands just offstage, biting her lip, head down, as Alicia Keys sings. In a similar moment before this year’s Grammy performance – which earned her a redemptive standing ovation – Swift told herself, “This is either where you prove the people who like you right, or prove the people who hate you right. It’s up to you. Put on your banjo and go play.”\n\nShe un-hunches her shoulders, breathes deep, and walks toward the stage. “Come on baby with me,” she sings with exquisite tenderness, over a hushed guitar. “We’re gonna fly away from here/You were my best four years.”\n\nSwift makes it through the song. But afterward she breaks into a jog toward her trailer, weeping uncontrollably the whole way, smudging her eye makeup into wild streaks. Ten minutes later, when I say goodbye, she hasn’t stopped. “I was trying not to cry the whole song,” she says, shrugging helplessly.\n\nSome of the event’s stagehands were watching Swift from the sidelines, beefy arms folded. Goateed, ankle-tattooed, wallet-chained, they would’ve looked at home wielding pool cues at Altamont. But they’re soon frozen in place, transfixed by Taylor Swift, and by the time she’s halfway through “Ronan,” I catch one of them silently brushing away a tear.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: ‘Men hand me inspiration on a plate’\nBy Lina Das\n\nUPDATED: 06:57 EST, 21 October 2012\nWhen it comes to relationships – and revenge – pop superstar Taylor Swift lets her music do the talking…\n\nSinger Taylor Swift arrives at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards\n‘I’ve found that men I’ve dated who are in the same business can be really competitive,’ says Taylor\n\nIt 22, Taylor Swift is one of the biggest singer-songwriters in the world. Already the recipient of six Grammys and cited by Forbes magazine as the highest-paid celebrity under 30, having earned £35 million last year, Taylor has, in just a few short years, moved seamlessly from the country charts to mainstream popularity.\n\nHer songs, paeans to young love and the delicious pain of heartbreak, have an added frisson given that Taylor freely admits she writes songs about her life, and given, too, that she has an impressive back catalogue of boyfriends. Rumoured exes include actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Twilight’s Taylor Lautner, musician John Mayer and singer Joe Jonas, and they are all believed to have been subjects of Taylor’s catchy songs.\n\nWhile she scrupulously avoids mentioning them by name, they aren’t always shy about outing themselves (Mayer declared himself ‘humiliated’ by Taylor’s 2010 song ‘Dear John’). The release of every new album sends her legion of fans – commonly known as Swifties – scurrying to decipher her lyrics with the zeal of Bletchley Park code-breakers.\n\nGrowing up in Pennsylvania with her younger brother Austin, it was clear that Taylor was always destined for showbusiness. By the age of ten she was auditioning for Broadway shows and by 14 she had convinced her parents – father Scott, a stockbroker, and mother Andrea, a housewife – that a move to Nashville, the heart of country music, was essential if she was to succeed in her chosen career. She proved them right when her eponymous debut album, released when she was 16, was a hit with both critics and fans alike, and two further albums – Fearless and Speak Now – soon followed, giving Taylor record sales of over 20 million albums worldwide.\n\nWe meet prior to her storming performance at this year’s MTV Video Music Awards, where, in very short shorts and trademark red lipstick, she crowd-surfed with abandon. It was a far cry from her appearance at the VMAs three years ago, when collecting her award for Best Female Video for the song ‘You Belong With Me’, Kanye West famously interrupted her acceptance speech, announced that Beyoncé should have won instead, and exited the stage to a chorus of boos, leaving a shell-shocked Taylor speechless.\n\nToday, though, Taylor is a very different animal. Wry and seemingly older than her years, she’s intensely driven but also curiously tough on herself, despite all she has achieved at such a young age. Not content with a hugely successful music career, she has also launched a fragrance, Wonderstruck, and is looking to break into acting, too, with roles in movies such as Valentine’s Day and the animated film The Lorax already under her belt.\n\nTaylor Swift and her boyfriend Conor KennedyFirst lady Michelle Obama presents the big help award to Taylor Swift at Nickelodeon's 25th Annual Kids' Choice Awards\nFrom left: Taylor with latest beau Conor Kennedy, and receiving an award from Michelle Obama earlier this year\n\nNow with her new album Red and a rumoured romance with 18-year-old Conor Kennedy – son of Robert F Kennedy Jr – things couldn’t be looking better for Taylor. Here she talks love, lyrics, being mates with Spider-Man actress Emma Stone and the benefits of not wearing jewelled bras…\n\nIf a man dates me, he’s kind of signing a waiver saying he’s cool with me writing songs about him. I write songs about my life: it’s not something I’ve kept secret and pretty much everyone knows that, so no, I don’t worry that a new man will get upset about something I write. That being said, it’s mind-blowing how some guys have just handed me inspiration for some of these songs on a plate. Some have said, ‘Please don’t write about me,’ but only when we’re in the process of breaking up.\n\n‘We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together’ [rumoured to be about Jake Gyllenhaal, whom\nshe dated in 2010] is a song on the new album celebrating the end of a relationship. It’s a relationship where you’re stuck in an awful cycle of being together, breaking up, being together, breaking up, and it’s just so exhausting that by the time it’s completely over, you’re just relieved and excited that you’re finally done. He didn’t call afterwards – you don’t call someone when they’ve written that song about you. It’s not a subtle song at all.\n\nI’ve had a few semi-toxic relationships, but it’s not what I look for when I’m seeing someone. On my new album there’s a song called ‘Trouble’, which describes a relationship where you see all the red flags, but you ignore them and regret it and feel mad with yourself afterwards. It’s like walking into a burning room and being surprised that your clothes end up smelling of smoke.\n\nIf I get happy, will I stop writing songs? I’ve been asked that a lot recently. There are a few with a positive outlook on love on my new album, but there are also some about the dark, twisty, awful emotions you feel during a break-up. I’d really like to end up being happy most of the time, so I’m hoping that doesn’t go hand in hand with being creatively stifled.\n\nI’ve found that men I’ve dated who are in the same business can be really competitive. I’ve found a great group of girlfriends in the same business who aren’t competitive, but a few times guys have started comparing careers and it has been…challenging. The last thing I think about when I fall for someone is what they do for a living as I like to get to know that person, but sometimes guys start acting weirdly towards me, especially if I get good news and they get bad… It’s usually downhill from there.\n\nTaylor Swift \n‘I write about the dark, twisty, awful emotions you feel during a break-up’\n\nEd Sheeran and I wrote a duet called ‘Everything Has Changed’ while sitting on a trampoline in my back yard. It’s a lot easier than you think. We had one guitar, which we passed back and forth, and then we baked an apple pie, or rather my friends and I baked it and Ed watched and then\nate it afterwards. His performance at the Olympic closing ceremony was incredible – I really think that was his big breakthrough moment in the US.\n\nYou can’t generalise about an entire country, but I like the energy of British men. Ed’s such a good friend of mine now – he’s just the coolest guy and so much fun. I love that British dry, sarcastic sense of humour.\n\nWhen I first started writing songs I was pretty lonely. I was about 12 and at school in Pennsylvania. I wasn’t popular and didn’t have many friends, and never knew where to sit at lunch. But songwriting became a release. I’d think, ‘OK, three more classes to go and then I can write about this’, so it became a reward. I didn’t know how to articulate my feelings, but I’d strum my guitar and the words would come out. It allowed me to understand better the way I felt and get through it.\n\nI was never a boy magnet at school. There was always the girl all the guys liked and wanted to date, but it was never me. It would have been fun to find out what that would have been like, though. I’ve always been a girl’s girl.\n\nI used to hate being tall. All the cool girls were the same perfect height and I was a head taller than them. I felt weird about it until I got older and then every once in a while someone would compliment me on my height. I started thinking, ‘Well, maybe this isn’t something I should hate any more.’\n\nMeeting Michelle Obama was like an out-of-body experience. She was presenting me with a Kids’ Choice Award [in March] and she said, ‘Come by the White House any time.’ Unfortunately, I haven’t done it yet, but I might just pop in for tea one day. She was so lovely and approachable.\n\nEmma [Stone] and I are great friends. It all started when we turned up at an awards ceremony wearing the same shade of purple. Although it could have been a disaster, we were so excited about it that we ran up to each other and started talking. That was five years ago and we’ve been friends ever since. We spend hours talking on the phone about life and love, but never business. She doesn’t give advice – she asks you a dozen questions about your problem so you end up figuring it out on your own. She’s like a therapist and she doesn’t even charge.\n\nMy brother gives really good advice from a guy’s perspective. He’ll always tell me, ‘You know there are no rules, right? So if you want to text this guy back, text him back.’ Saying that, I don’t do the chasing. You kind of learn that in school.\n\nMy parents moved to Nashville because of me. I was desperate to move there as a kid because I thought it would be the best place for me to break into the music industry, but my parents took all the pressure off by saying, ‘We’re just moving because we love the area, so don’t worry.’ They knew nothing about the industry and had no involvement in entertainment, but I was obsessed with it and so they did their research and read up about it to help me in every way they could. They’re amazing people.\n\nKanye West jumps onstage after Taylor Swift won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music AwardsTaylor Swift performing onstage 2012 MTV Video Music Awards Show\nFrom left: Taylor at the VMAs three years ago, when Kanye West interrupted her acceptance speech for Best Female Video and announced that Beyoncé should have won; and at this year’s VMAs, crowd-surfing with abandon \n\nIn case you can’t tell, I’m a really big worrier. I can’t believe I get to have the life I have, so I’ve got a complete fear of messing up, of making a misstep where it all comes crumbling down. It’s a high-wire act in my brain all the time.\n\nWhen I was naughty as a kid, I used to send myself to my own room. My mum says that she was afraid to punish me sometimes because I was so hard on myself when I did something wrong. I haven’t changed much since then. I live half my life in the present and half of it as an 80-year-old grandmother. My grandkids will be able to read about what I got up to as a 22-year-old, so I want to make sure that they’re reading things that are good. I know that’s forward planning to a crazy degree, but I want them to be proud of me.\n\nWhen coming up with a new fragrance, I wanted the crew from Elizabeth Arden to come to my apartment so they could see what the inside of my mind looks like. It’s very Alice in Wonderland meets Harry Potter and I wanted to have some of those influences when it came to designing the bottle. I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of creating a fragrance and tying it in with a song. The name of my perfume, Wonderstruck, comes from the song ‘Enchanted’ from my album Speak Now. The lyric goes, ‘I’m wonderstruck, blushing all the way home’, and it describes that first moment when you meet someone new.\n\nSinger Taylor Swift arrives at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards\nI’d like people to remember me for my songwriting, not my hotpants. As soon as I turned 18, I noticed, particularly during the edgier photo shoots, that people were saying, ‘Well, you can wear this shirt or this bra with jewels on it,’ so there’s always the option of going down that road if you choose to. I love a jewelled bra on someone else. Me, I’d rather wear the shirt.\n\nI don’t read the gossip pages and if I see my name on a website, I click off immediately. I’m not thick-skinned at all, so if I read something mean about myself, I become really insecure and obsess over it. The thing is, if somebody has said something bad, I’ve probably said that stuff to myself a hundred times already. When you have a tendency to over-analyse, you have enough of an idea of what you’re insecure about already – you don’t need to be reminded of it in an article.\n\nI think I’m the one person in the world who hasn’t read Fifty Shades of Grey. I read anything that people say is good, but I tend to read books mainly when I’m on tour. The last ones I read were the Hunger Games books. Suzanne Collins writes in such a way that you’re itching to read the next chapter – it’s almost musical in a way.\n\nI don’t really feel the need to party like crazy. I drink occasionally but I usually have something to do the next morning so I don’t drink a lot. But I love having fun with my friends. I’m really not as dull as I’m making out right now.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Aside from acting on the impulse to drive former boyfriends aurally insane, Swift continues to make dramatic artistic strides on Red, the 22-year-old's fourth studio album, out Monday. Her lyrics are less likely to take on a petulant tone; she's less apt to play the victim, more willing to own up to a role as willing participant in relationships, even the ones that aren't healthy.\n\nRed also shows Swift expanding her musical vocabulary. She recorded duets with British singer/songwriter Ed Sheeran and Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody. After recording her first three albums in Nashville with Nathan Chapman, she worked with seven sets of producers, including Chapman, on Red's 16 tracks.\n\n\"It was almost like an apprenticeship,\" she says.\n\nThat collaborative impulse grew out of her 2011-2012 Speak Now world tour, in which she covered different songs in nearly every city and invited artists including Justin Bieber, Nicki Minaj, Usher and James Taylor to sing onstage with her.\n\n\"We had so much fun pulling other artists in and letting their styles rub off on our performances, singing their songs and having it become sort of a duet,\" Swift says. \"(So) it just felt natural to want this to be a group album.\n\n\"Writing Speak Now was a very solitary experience. It ended up being something I was so proud of, but it was a very different dynamic than getting text messages from 12 people when something good happens.\"\n\nBefore the tour wrapped in March, Swift already had an album's worth of material in the can. Only about half those recordings made the final version of Red.\n\n\"During Speak Now, when I went to (label head) Scott Borchetta and said, 'The album's finished,' he said, 'No, it's not -- you need to keep writing.' With Red, he came to me in January and said, 'I think the album's finished.' This time, I said, 'No, it's not -- I need to keep writing.' \"\n\nAt that point, she went to Chapman, with whom she had sold 16 million albums, and told him she wanted to work with other producers, too.\n\n\"I encouraged her to branch out and to test herself in other situations,\" says Chapman, who co-produced half of Red's songs. \"Her artistry is so strong that I wasn't worried if she were to work with other people that she would chameleon into their sound. I was more excited for these other guys to get to have Taylor's sound on their stuff.\"\n\nSwift wound up writing and producing songs not only with Martin and Shellback, but also Jeff Bhasker (fun., Kanye West) and Dan Wilson (Adele, the Dixie Chicks).Butch Walker, who once covered Swift's You Belong With Me, produced Everything Has Changed, her duet with Sheeran, while Snow Patrol producer Jacknife Lee produced The Last Time, her duet with Lightbody. Dann Huff, who has produced Keith Urban and Rascal Flatts, worked with Swift and Chapman on three songs.\n\n\"I chose the artists and the producers because I like their style,\" Swift says. \"I didn't choose them because I wanted to force my style on them; I chose them because I wanted to learn from them. So they're true collaborations, it's not just somebody else singing on one of my songs that sounds like one of my songs. It's a real mixture of the two influences.\"\n\nOn the resulting album, Swift sounds less like the country-pop singer of Our Song and Mean and more like the young woman once obsessed with Dashboard Confessional who now runs with Selena Gomez and Hot Chelle Rae. Swift has always had a thread of heart-on-the-sleeve punk-pop melodicism running just beneath the pedal steels and guitar banjos, but it shows more prominently on Red.\n\nRed begins and ends on romantically hopeful notes with State of Grace and Begin Again, respectively. \"This is the golden age of something good and right and real,\" she sings in State of Grace. But Swift's history with men being what it is, things head south quickly.\n\nChronologically, the album began with All Too Well, a song she wrote almost two years ago with Liz Rose, one of her earliest and most regular co-writers. The song came after a six-month writing drought that followed a particularly toxic relationship.\n\n\"There's a kind of bad that gets so overpowering you can't even write about it,\" she says of that time. \"When you feel pain that is so far past dysfunctional, that leaves you with so many emotions that you can't filter them down to simple emotions to write about, that's when you know you really need to get out.\"\n\nAnother track, Treacherous, written with Wilson, is one of the most overtly sexual songs Swift has ever written and includes the line, \"I'll do anything you say if you say it with your hands.\"\n\n\"That song was about a person that I knew, from the minute I saw him, that it would end in fiery, burning wreckage,\" she says. \"There's something about that magnetic draw that doesn't really let up. You walk toward it anyway.\"\n\nAfter a string of bad relationships, Swift says, \"I can say I'd honestly rather be happy than have 30 to 40 songs that I've written about these thrilling, exciting, horrible, unhappy times. I know red flags, and I steer away from them, because I have a priority on being happy.\n\n\"At some point, you grow out of being attracted to that flame that burns you over and over and over again. Thankfully, I hadn't learned that lesson yet when I wrote this record.\"\n\nAs usual, Swift avoids discussing identities when it comes to the subjects of the new material. Asked about her relationship with 18-year-old Conor Kennedy, the son of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., she gets practically non-verbal.\n\n\"I like the way the stories of my relationships sound to music more than the way they look in print, in gossip columns or in me talking about them in interviews,\" she says. \"I think it's a better way of telling the stories.\"\n\nBesides, if Swift declines to discuss a current relationship, she believes fans will get the story eventually.\n\n\"My fans don't feel like I hold anything back from them,\" she says. \"They know whatever I'm going through now, they'll hear about it on a record someday. They'll hear the real story. There's a little bit of lag time. It's not as instant as going on a gossip blog. But it's much more accurate.\"\n\nIn addition to We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, Swift already has released four other songs to iTunes: Red, State of Grace, Begin Again and I Knew You Were Trouble. Together, they outline the album, musically and thematically, while leaving several surprises for the album release. However you hear them, though, there's not much country.\n\nSwift fans that also like country music may love Red, but country music fans who also like Swift might not find it so appealing. The country mix of We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together stalled at No 16 on USA TODAY's country airplay chart shortly after its release. (It's No. 3 on USA TODAY's top 40 chart.)\n\n\"Her single was not met with a lot of love from our audience,\" says Gregg Swedberg, program director at country station KEEY-FM in Minneapolis. \"I honestly believe this album is as good or better than the last one was. That doesn't mean it's as good for country as the last one was.\"\n\nFor Swift fans, though, she's practically her own format. She has already sold more than 3.8 million downloads from Red, and the anticipation for the album's release shows an eagerness on the part of her audience to hear more of her new directions.\n\n\"I've grown in the sense that I've allowed my influences to infiltrate my music more,\" Swift says. \"Going into the studio with producers I had never worked with before was definitely a way of stretching musically. I knew I couldn't make the same record twice. I mean, I could have, but I'm not going to. With my fans, I've established a level of trust, and part of that trust is that I really don't want to bore them.\"",

You want to provide your fans with something exciting, but you don’t want them to be listening to the album going, ‘I don’t recognize her.’ So it’s somewhere in the middle. You have to find a balance.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Backbeat: Big Machine's Scott Borchetta On Taylor Swift Going Pop, Clear Channel Royalty Pact\nSeptember 24, 2012   |    By Andrew Hampp, Las Vegas\n Big Machine Label Group CEO Scott Borchetta (left) who told Taylor Swift (right) when she was making her new album Red the she had \"artistic license\" to head in any music direction she wanted. (Photo: Andrew Hampp)\n\nBig Machine Label Group CEO Scott Borchetta brought radio and labels back together in a landmark royalty deal earlier this year with Clear Channel that compensated a record label for pay-for-play performance royalties in addition to the historical compensation awarded to songs' writers and publishers. Next, Borchetta would like to see some similar cooperation between streaming music services like Spotify, where Taylor Swift's \"We Are Never Getting Back Together,\" his label's biggest hit, has yet to appear.\n\n\"I personally struggle with that model - I don't think that it should be free,\" Borchetta told Billboard. \"We've spoken with the services, and spoken with Spotify in particular - I'm meeting with them next week - and we've talked about a lot of different things. We just haven't hit on the right model that works for us. I don't have thousands and thousands of albums and hundreds and hundreds of artists, I have a finite artist roster and finite number of releases. If you're a big battleship like Sony or Universal and have tens of thousands of masters, that income stream makes sense at a big corporation. It doesn't make sense to a small record company.\"\n\nBorchetta is also pleased with the progress with Big Machine and Clear Channel's royalty pact, which was the result of a conversation he had with CEO Bob Pittman and entertainment president John Sykes at this year's Grammys. \"What it gets down to is, 'if you're not making a dollar in broadcasting, how can we ask for a dollar? But hey, where you are doing business, include us, and where you're not, we support you. We support the growth of radio -- we love radio.\"\n\nAs for Swift's \"Red,\" out Oct. 22, Borchetta is excited about the singer's stylistic shift to more rock and pop-oriented music. The record features collaborations with Max Martin and Shellback on \"Never Ever\" as well as Jackknife Lee (U2, R.E.M.), Train's Pat Monahan, UK singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, producer Jeff Bhasker (fun.'s \"We Are Young\") and Semisonic's Dan Wilson (Adele's \"Someone Like You\"), as well as continued work with longtime producer Nathan Chapman and a first-time team-up with Nashville mainstay Dann Huff, who pitched in for a few songs and re-worked \"Never Ever\" for country radio.\n\nAlthough the latter has helped Swift maintain airplay with her country base, \"There was a really specific moment that she and Max Martin and Shellback created and it's very much a pop record. We've never hidden behind what it is,\" Borchetta says. To that end, there likely won't be a dual commercial release of the song's country version a la Shania Twain's \"Up!\", her 2002 record that famously featured dual versions of every song to please pop and country fans alike. \"As of now we have no plans\" to release the country mix of \"Never Ever,\" Borchetta added.\n\nThat similar lack of forcing genres translated to the rest of his input on the making of \"Red.\" \"We were in the studio pretty early on and the songs she was writing I would say, 'if it's country run toward it, if it's rock run toward it. You have the artistic license.' Our music needs to explore the edges like I feel it always has.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Tells Glamour the Stuff She Usually Only Tells Her Girlfriends in Her November 2012 Interview\n\nSeptember 30, 2012\nIn six short years, Taylor Swift has gone from a precocious teen country singer to a major (major!) pop star. In her November 2012 interview with Glamour, she opens up about her career, her friends, and her own latest \"love story.\" Read on for a sneak peek at what she told Cynthia McFadden.\n\nTaylor Swift on her songs about past relationships and not listening to the gossip…\n\nGlamour: And \"Dear John,\" also about a failed relationship, still seems to be resonating strongly. Does that surprise you?\n\nTaylor Swift: I think that song really hit home with a lot of girls who had been through toxic relationships and had found their way to the other side of it. I've never looked out while singing a song during a concert to see so many girls crying.\n\nGlamour: You never identified who it was about, but John Mayer recently told Rolling Stone that it was him.\n\nTaylor Swift: How presumptuous! I never disclose who my songs are about.\n\nGlamour: He said he felt…\n\nTaylor Swift: No! I don't want to know, I don't want to know.\n\nGlamour: You don't? [Mayer told Rolling Stone that he was \"humiliated\" by the song, and that Swift's releasing it was \"a really lousy thing for her to do.\"]\n\nTaylor Swift: I know it wasn't good, so I don't want to know. I put a high priority on staying happy, and I know what I can't handle.\n\nGlamour: It would hurt too much to hear?\n\nTaylor Swift: It's not that I'm this egomaniac and I don't want to hear anything negative, because I do keep myself in check. But I've never developed that thick a skin. So I just kind of live a life, and I let all the gossip live somewhere else. If you go too far down the rabbit hole of what people think about you, it can change everything about who you are.\n\nTaylor Swift on her new relationship and the Kennedys…\n\nGlamour: So there's a lot of talk about you and the Kennedys these days. There are reports that you are dating Conor Kennedy.\n\nTaylor Swift: I don't talk about my personal life in great detail. I write about it in my songs, and I feel like you can share enough about your life in your music to let people know what you're going through.\n\nGlamour: Ethel Kennedy, Conor's grandmother, was asked what she would think of having you as a \"granddaughter-in-law,\" and she said, \"We should be so lucky.\"\n\nTaylor Swift: She's fantastic. I love her.\n\nTaylor Swift on the importance of having girlfriends and maturing with celeb-besties Emma Stone and Selena Gomez…\n\nGlamour: I know you have many close girlfriends. Are they helpful in keeping your worries in check?\n\nTaylor Swift: They are so important in my life right now. I'm the kind of girl who needs to tell her friends everything. I've developed this really close-knit group of girls. Two of my close friends are bandmates. My other close friends are Ashley, Claire, Diana, Emma, and Selena.\n\nGlamour: Emma is Emma Stone, and Selena is Selena Gomez. Is it nice to have friends who are also famous?\n\nMost Popular\nThe Best TV Shows of 2024, According to Glamour Editors\nEntertainment\nThe Best TV Shows of 2024, According to Glamour Editors\nBy Monique Wilson\nThe Best Shapewear Pieces That Actually Wow’d Us\nStyle\nThe Best Shapewear Pieces That Actually Wow’d Us\nBy Brigitt Earley\n44 Yankee Swap Gifts Everyone Will Fight to Keep\nGift Guides\n44 Yankee Swap Gifts Everyone Will Fight to Keep\nBy Malia Griggs\nTaylor Swift: I met Emma when I was 17, and I met Selena when I was 18. So they've experienced all of this with me, and they've also experienced their own amazing success, and somehow through all of it, we've stayed close.\n\nTaylor Swift on being misunderstood and not being dark, twisty or complicated…\n\nGlamour: As a very public figure, how do you think you are misunderstood?\n\nTaylor Swift: I think some people think it's just apple pie and sunshine and sprinkles and ponies. Which is just funny. But I never feel the need to go out and make some grand statement that I'm dark and twisty and complicated, because I'm not that either. It's just not as simple as ponies and rainbows, though I do love ponies and rainbows.\n\nTaylor Swift on if she is wary of people using her for her fame and money…\n\nGlamour: Are you wary of people using you for your fame and money?\n\nTaylor Swift: I think you can tell who's a good person to be around, who makes you laugh, who's fun, whom you can trust. And, yes, you're going to get burned a few times, but I'd really rather get burned a few times than sit alone in that house with the curtains drawn. So God forbid this person you're hanging out with gets a bit of validation out of the fact you're famous. Is that the worst-case scenario? You know, it doesn't seem that bad.\n\n__To read the complete interview and see the entire November issue, pick up a copy of Glamour on newsstands October 9, or download the digital issue right now!

      "Transcript/Content": "Ensconced in a comfy office on Music Row where she’s been doing interviews all day, Taylor Swift looks casually chic in a sleek pair of black pants and sleeveless black top with white accents. Bestowing a hug before she settles back onto a black leather chair and puts her bare feet on the footstool, it’s easy to forget she’s a global superstar.\nThough polished and poised, Taylor exudes a disarming girl-next-door charm that makes\nan interview feel more like a fun conversation with a friend than a celebrity promoting a new project. There’s talk about clothes, hair and girl stuff before settling into the topic at hand—the Oct. 22 release of her new album, Red.\n\nThe project has already made history as the first single, “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 all-genre chart. The song’s debut sales of 623,000 downloads made it the biggest opening week for a song by a female artist in history.\n\n“‘We Are Never Ever Ever Getting Back Together’ was a song that just said something that I hadn’t said before,” Taylor tells Country Weekly. “[It’s about] the moment where you’ve been in and out of a bad relationship and you are so done. You are so done in fact that it feels like a celebration to talk about how done you are.” Though there was speculation in the press about who Taylor wrote the song about, she prefers not to name the ex-boyfriend who inspired it. “I’ve never named who anything was about. People make their assumption and then it becomes fact,” she says, obviously a little frustrated by the misinformation that swirls around her life and career. “One of the things that I always keep with me is the ability to be the only one who knows who these songs are really about.”\nThough she refuses to name names when it comes to her relationships, Taylor is known for opening up her\nheart and pouring all her emotions into her songs. The whole world is listening, but that hasn’t caused Taylor to censor herself or become more guarded in her writing. “Writing songs is something\nI’ve done since I was 12 years old. I’ve always done it for the same reasons and it hasn’t always produced the same result,” she explains. “The songs that I wrote when I was 12 ended up being played in coffeehouses when I’d sing them, and then they would just kind of disappear when I outgrew them. The songs that I write now end up all over the world for everyone to hear, so I think it’s the fact that I’ve been writing since I was so young that my motivations behind it haven’t changed. I haven’t started to guard myself in the form of songwriting. I’ve learned to guard areas of my life that I have to keep for just me, like my personal life.\n\n“I’d so much rather sing about it in songs than have it be me talking about what’s going on in my personal life all the time or ever in the media,” she continues, “but I somehow feel like it’s OK and actually helpful for me to write about it. People read theories from gossip blogs as to what’s going on in my life and there’s something really fun about knowing that they don’t really know what really happened from my perspective until I put out an album and there are songs about it.”\n\nIt’s no secret that much of Taylor’s inspiration comes from relationships, and whether she’s writing a song or chatting with strangers, love is always a favorite topic. “I end up in conversations about relationships no matter what,” she says with a smile. “When I talk to fans and I see them in public or I run into them at Starbucks or at the airport or something, they always ask me about their boyfriend issues and I love it! It’s like my favorite thing to talk about.\nI was in the park the other day and I ran into these two 16-year-old girls and one was talking about her boyfriend. We got into this whole conversation about him and I just love talking about love. I love writing about love. I love thinking about love because it’s so unpredictable.”\n\nNeedless to say, many of the 16 songs on the new album are about relationships. Taylor penned 10 of the tunes by herself and co-wrote the remaining tracks. “Trouble” is a song about a guy who’s bad news. “I came up with that melody months before I went into the studio with [songwriter and producer] Max [Martin],” she says. “I walked into the studio and I was like, I want to write this song about how I felt this different kind of heartbreak recently where I’m not like, ‘Shame on you, you broke my heart’; I’m thinking, ‘Shame on me, you broke my heart. I knew the red flags. I saw them. I saw the warning signs. I walked right past them, right into your arms and then I got absolutely tricked.’ The feeling of being tricked is almost worse than being heartbroken because you knew better. You’re not blindsided. You saw this coming, but you let wishful thinking get in the way, and that’s what I’ve been guilty of a few times.”\n\nAmong the album’s many highlights is a song titled “All Too Well,” which Taylor cites as the hardest song she’s ever written. “It’s about this relationship that I had and it tells the story of it from start to finish, so it’s all these pieces of memories, one by one listed off. It’s one of the most vivid pictures that I’ve ever gotten to paint with a song,” she says of the song she co-wrote with Liz Rose. “It’s the first song I wrote for the record a year and a half ago. I called her and said, ‘I’ve been working on this song and it’s going to be nine minutes long if I finish it the way that it is. You’ve got to help me edit this down, make it more concise and make it a story that can be told in the form of a song that isn’t going to be an hour long because I’ve written so much.’ She came over and we sat down and wrote it and it became one of the songs on the record that displays the most amount of hurt. It starts off with the innocent beginnings and goes all the way down to the bitter end and follows the relationship as it’s crashing down, and the hook of it is, I was there. I remember it all too well.”\n\nIn recording her first three albums, Taylor worked with producer Nathan Chapman and the two still collaborated on Red, but she also reached out to some different producers this time, including Nashville producer Dann Huff, whose credits include Keith Urban and Rascal Flatts. She also worked with Max Martin and Swedish writer/producer Shellback, well known for their work with Britney Spears, and Butch Walker, an acclaimed musician/writer/producer who has collaborated with P!nk, Avril Lavigne and All-American Rejects. “I’m really excited about the lyrics and the stories told on this record, but I’m also really excited about the different people that I reached out to who painted the picture in a different way productionwise,” she says. “I’d always been curious about working with Max Martin, so I wrote with Max Martin and Shellback and did some production work with Jeff Bhasker, who does the band Fun who have that song ‘We Are Young’ that’s so good. I worked with Dan Wilson, who is amazing. He was in Semisonic. . . . I did a collaboration with Ed Sheeran and did a duet with Snow Patrol and then had a song that Butch Walker produced, so there are a lot of collaborations.”\n\nTaylor is a big fan of British-born singer/ songwriter Ed Sheeran and is excited about him being on her new album. “His music video was playing in Australia when I was on tour there and I loved his voice and the way he sings and the way he crafts his songs,” Taylor says. “I came back to the States and I said to my management company, ‘I really want to work with this guy,’ and they said, ‘That’s really funny because we just got a request from him to write with you.’ It just worked out perfectly. I met up with him at one of his shows and we wrote some songs that day. He came to California and we wrote some more songs. The one that made the album is a duet called ‘Everything Has Changed.’”\n\nTaylor says it’s hard to pick a favorite song from the new album because they are such an “eclectic bunch,” but she chose “Red” as the title track because it anchors the collection. “‘Red’ defines what this album is about,” she says. “I called the album Red because when I started really thinking about what red is as a color, it defines the most intense emotions, whether you are dealing with love, passion, intrigue or you are dealing with anger, hurt, jealousy. It also is a color for adventure and that’s what this record was. It was a big adventure.”\n\nBeyond the recording process, most every aspect of Taylor’s life these days is a big adventure. Two days after this interview, Taylor was flying to Paris to shoot a video for “Begin Again.” She has lots of traveling in her future as she’ll be promoting Red all over the world. “I will be in Japan for Thanksgiving, so I probably won’t be having the traditional Thanksgiving dinner at all,” she says with a smile. “Directly after that, I’ll be in Australia.”\n\nWhen she is finally at home, Taylor says she likes to unwind by ordering food in, catching up with friends and simply relaxing. “I love my own space! I love it,” she says of life in Nashville. “I have an apartment that overlooks the whole city, which is nice because I get to look out and see my favorite place.\n\n“My life is spent having people surrounding me all the time, either hair and makeup or walking into the next interview or . . . there’s an audience and I’m signing autographs,” she continues. “It’s a very social experience living my life, so when I get home, it’s so nice to live alone. It’s so nice just to collapse into bed and watch TV for a few hours.”\n\nTaylor enjoys having time to unplug and relax, but she’s worked hard to get to this point in her career and she’s grateful for all the opportunities. There’s no grousing about her hectic life. She’s gracious and appreciative and remarkably down-to-earth, especially considering her level of success. “I never have a normal day, which is so much fun because my life is never the same two days in a row. It’s never routine,” she says, smiling.\n“I’m always somewhere different. I’m always somewhere new. The TV shows are different in every country. The interview is always different. The concert experience is the closest thing I get to a normal routine, but that’s in a different state every day. This job was perfect for me because I love that adventure!”\n\nTaylor followed up the feisty break-up anthem with a new single, “Begin Again.” “Putting out ‘Begin Again’ was something that we felt was the right thing to do from the perspective of the story that we’re telling,” Taylor explains. “We started with ‘We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,’ which is like ‘we’re done,’ and ‘Begin Again’ is much more of an introspective look on the fact that you don’t get to a point of being done with a relationship without experiencing some sort of hurt. This was a song that I wrote much later on after the relationship ended and I looked back at it and thought, ‘I really lost myself there.’ That’s a hard thing to come to terms with, realizing that you’ve changed something about yourself every day, little by little, and woke up and really didn’t recognize yourself anymore. So to have that song go to No. 1 on iTunes, within hours of it being put up, was really gratifying because you’ve got a song that’s dealing with all your insecurities and it’s sitting at No. 1.”\nTaylor Swift Fills In the Blanks\nI would never . . . sky dive or bungee jump.\n\nI wish I were better at . . . sports.\n\nI’m trying to quit . . . midnight snacks that turn into meals at 4 in the morning. [I’m trying to quit ] eating after 10 p.m.\n\nMy favorite hobby is . . . antique shopping.\n\nI always make sure I . . . talk to people politely.\n\nMy biggest fear is . . . losing someone I love.\n\nI never leave home without . . . my phone.\n\nMy perfect day is . . . hanging out with my friends, going on a girls’ trip to the beach, running around acting like little kids, having a kitchen dance party, laughing, talking, catching up with all my friends that I haven’t seen in forever.\n\nTaylor Swift’s Fans Want To Know\nWhat is the greatest change you see in yourself on Red compared to who and where you were two years ago and on Speak Now? —Amy Curzenski\nTaylor: I think the biggest change and the best change is my sense of curiosity when it comes to wanting to learn more, wanting to expand what I do. I think the best thing that happened was a year in [to making this record] my label said, “You’ve made a great record. You’re done. Congratulations! If you want to be done you can be,” and I just looked at them and said, “No I’m not. I need to go and work with new people and learn more than what I know now.”\n\nWhat are you listening to lately? Any albums or songs you can’t go without? —Yael Spivakovsky\nT: Listening to that song [by Florida Georgia Line] “Cruise” and One Republic, Rihanna, Coldplay, Tim McGraw, Jimmy Eat World, of course Ed Sheeran, pretty much everything, Nicki Minaj. It’s all over the place.\n\nDo you think it was important for you to live the normal high school experience before becoming fa- mous? Do you think that’s why your fans can identify so much with you? —Alexandra Behrens\nT: I really liked going to school when I moved to Tennessee. It was amazing because I had friends. I went to class. I left class. My mom would drive me downtown. I’d write songs with other songwriters. I’d go home, do my homework. It was kind of a fun balance of things, and then I don’t necessarily feel like I missed out on something big because I didn’t physically go to school my junior and senior year. I just felt like I was doing what I wanted to do with my life. I was getting the best education I possibly could out on the road. I was definitely inspired a lot by being in school and all the social observations you make being there, but I don’t think I needed to go to those last two years to be able to understand what I needed to do with my life. I figured it out pretty early.\n\nIf you could relive any moment in your life, what would it be and why? —Anna Caneato\nT: It would be the jumping up and down and dancing in the street that I saw my record label executives\nand president do in L.A. when we won the Album of the Year Grammy. I had to go straight to Australia after the Grammys, but I stopped by my label party and I saw these seasoned executives just jumping up and down like little boys and I’d just never seen them act like that. To see people act so out of character and celebrating some- thing that happened with me, it was amazing.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing to do to unwind after a long day? —Zack Hourihane\nT: Order take-out food or delivery food and sit there, watching TV with my cat and maybe call my friends that I hadn’t seen in a while. I spend a lot of time on the phone with my friends.\n\nWhere did you draw your inspira- tion from for your upcoming album? —Samantha Matta\nT: I drew inspiration from my own story lines, my friend’s story lines, movies, things that I would see happening around me, people, places. I’d watch a movie and think, “If I could write a soundtrack to this moment, what would it sound like?”\n\nWhat’s one goal you have for your- self that you hope to accomplish but haven’t yet? —Morgan Feyedelem\nT: I would love to be in a movie and have me be really proud of the way that it turned out.\n\nWhat happens to the songs that don’t make it on the album? —Stephanie Orta\nT: They either end up being bonus tracks down the line, or they get just shelved.\n\nWhat’s the hardest song you’ve ever written? —Bethany Polson\nT: Probably “All Too Well” [on Red] because it took me a really long time to funnel it down to the story line that it needed to end up being.\n\nHow is Meredith, your cat? —Janie Ziegle\nT: She’s fantastic. She’s just laying around being a cat.\n\nDoes she travel with you?\nT: Yeah, except out of the country, but everywhere else she is with me.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: 'I want to believe in pretty lies'\nThis article is more than 12 years old\nHer country-tinged pop narratives of love and romance have made her a superstar. She talks about her new album Red, the importance of fairytales – and her fear that the magic won't last\nAlex Macpherson\nThu 18 Oct 2012 18.06 CEST\nShare\n114\nWhen Taylor Swift talks about love and relationships, she dwells on them at length and in detail. \"My girlfriends and I are plagued by the idea, looking back, that [some boys] changed us,\" she muses. \"You look back and you think: I only wore black in that relationship. Or I started speaking differently. Or I started trying to act like a hipster. Or I cut off my friends and family because he wanted me to do that. It's an unfortunate problem.\"\n\nOne gets the impression that Swift, who describes herself as a \"girls' girl\", has many such conversations: the skilful way in which her music untangles the minutiae of feelings has won her the hearts of a devoted fanbase to whom she is somewhere between a best friend and a big sister – awe-inspiring, but relatable. \"She's just – perfect,\" gasps Mica, 18, one of around 30 fans – mostly teenage girls – who have gathered outside the Connaught Hotel in London in the hope of a meet-and-greet. \"It's like she knows you,\" says Megan, 16, whose favourite Swift song is Back to December – one of the most accomplished numbers in a catalogue deep in detail-rich, resonant narratives. \"There are so many emotions that you're feeling, you can get stifled by them if you're feeling them all at once,\" Swift says. \"What I try to do is take one moment – one simple, simple feeling – and expand it into three-and-a-half minutes.\"\n\nHer gift for this has ensured a seamless rise from country starlet to pop megastar. At 14, Swift began working the Nashville songwriting circuit; when she was 22, MTV declared her to be \"single-handedly keeping the [music] industry afloat\", after she easily topped Billboard's list of top money-makers in 2011. As the sales, awards and plaudits have poured in, the closest Swift's poise has come to slipping is her infamous expression of surprise when Kanye West stormed the stage at the 2009 MTV Music Video awards to protest at Swift receiving the Best Female Video award.\n\nAs a songwriter, Swift draws on familiar, even well-worn, references, but she navigates her way through cliches to bring her romances to life. The subtle shift in tense in Back to December, for instance, underlining the futility of obsessive regret; or the way in which Begin Again – the closing track on her fourth and latest album, Red – tells two stories in tandem, the shadow of the past implied in every line behind the hope of the present. \"In this moment now – capture it, remember it,\" sang Swift on 2008's Fearless – a perfect summation of her musical MO. \"I'm really intrigued by that,\" she reflects. \"Whether it's taking a photograph, or painting a picture with your words that make a song as vivid as a photograph. I've always felt music is the only way to give an instantaneous moment the feel of slow motion. To romanticise it and glorify it and give it a soundtrack and a rhythm.\"\n\nSwift's tendency to romanticise has not gone uncriticised. Detractors have accused her of everything from peddling false fairytales to young girls, to continually complaining about ex-boyfriends. She dismisses the snark curtly: \"When we're falling in love or out of it, that's when we most need a song that says how we feel. Yeah, I write a lot of songs about boys. And I'm very happy to do that.\" But what's more interesting about Swift's penchant for romance is the conflict that's underpinned it ever since she gently, sadly called it out in the very first line of her career: \"He said the way my blue eyes shine put those Georgia stars to shame that night. I said, that's a lie.\" Swift may buy into a patriarchal fantasy on Love Story, but she rejects it precisely for being a fantasy on White Horse. And the counterpoint to Swift's love of capturing moments is her obsession with impermanence and the passing of time.\n\n\"I think that one thing I'm really afraid of is … that magic doesn't last,\" she says. \"That butterflies and daydreams and love, all these things that I hold so dear, are going to leave some day. I haven't had a relationship that's lasted for ever. I only know about them starting and ending. Those are my fears. I spend a lot of time balancing between faith and disbelief.\"\n\nDoes she think the way fairytales are sold to young girls can be damaging?\n\n\"A fairytale is an interesting concept. There's 'happily ever after' at the end, but that's not a part of our world. Everything is an ongoing storyline and you're always battling the complexities of life. But what I got from fairytales, growing up, was a beautiful daydream. I'm glad I had the craziest imagination and believed in all sorts of things that don't exist.\"\n\nSwift acknowledges her propensity for sentimentalising childhood, though. \"I think there's something we have as little kids that goes away sometimes. I don't care about looking youthful for ever, but I care about seeming youthful.\" Today, Swift eventually comes down on the side of hope – but it's the vertiginous way in which escapism can crash up against reality that is the true hallmark of her music. \"I want to believe in pretty lies,\" she smiles wryly. \"But unfortunately that can lead you to write songs like the ones on my new record.\"\n\nSwift possesses a fervent faith in the power of the pop song: she reminisces about the Shania Twain songs from her childhood \"that could make you want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\"; last year, she scrawled the Bruce Springsteen lyric \"We learned more from a three-minute record than we ever learned in school\" on her arm for a live show. Now, she is a voracious pop fan. Anyone familiar with either her impromptu cover of Nicki Minaj's Super Bass last year or the Eminem cover with which she used to open her shows will be unsurprised to learn of her love of hip-hop (\"One of the things people don't really recognise about the similarities between country and hip-hop is that they're celebrations of pride in a lifestyle\"); lately, she has been researching Joni Mitchell in preparation for an as-yet-unconfirmed film role. \"She's gone through so many shades of herself,\" Swift says, admiringly.\n\nAll of this shows on Red, which finds Swift dipping a toe into waters that, for her, are hitherto uncharted: working with heavyweight pop producers and writers such as Max Martin and experimenting with slick, electronic beats. There's even a dubstep drop on I Knew You Were Trouble: remarkably, it ends up being rather amazing. Swift's line is that, following 2008's Fearless (written with a tight-knit cohort of collaborators) and 2010's Speak Now (entirely self-penned), working with established names on Red is another means of challenging herself – rather than a deliberate attempt to crack open a country-shy international market. Nonetheless, there's a trace of smugness when she declares: \"What ended up happening is, we ended up using the ideas that I brought into the studio sessions.\" Indeed, the pop sheen is limited to a handful of tracks sprinkled among more recognisably Swiftian fare: sweeping, soft-rock arrangements as the unassuming backdrop for narratives with twist endings that cast the whole song in a different light, like a subtly adjusted rearview mirror.\n\nSwift maintains a non-negotiable policy of never explicitly linking her songs to any of her various famous beaux – despite providing feverishly analysed clues in her liner notes. She views the speculation with schoolmarmish equanimity, declaring approvingly: \"It doesn't bother me when people try to deconstruct my songs – because at least they're looking at the lyrics, and paying attention to the way the story is told.\" But one of the more amusing aspects of Red is the recurring shade Swift throws at indie hipsters: it's fair to assume that it stems from firsthand experience. On her current single We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together she offers a sarcastic dismissal: \"Hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.\"\n\n\"That was the most important line of the song,\" Swift says. \"It was a relationship where I felt very critiqued and subpar. He'd listen to this music that nobody had heard of … but as soon as anyone else liked these bands, he'd drop them. I felt that was a strange way to be a music fan. And I couldn't understand why he would never say anything nice about the songs I wrote or the music I made.\"\n\nIn many ways, Swift – a \"hopeless romantic\", sincere to a fault – is the antithesis of cool; the writer Erika Villani has astutely identified this very uncoolness as the basis of many of her critics' arguments. It's long been so: Swift rattles off her favourite quotes from Mean Girls, arguably the defining teen movie of her generation, with relish, but the one time that her poise is even slightly shaken today is when she talks about the first car she bought with her earnings. It was a Lexus SC430 convertible – as owned by Regina George, ringleader of the film's bullying Plastics – an odd choice for a goody-goody like Swift?\n\n\"All the girls who were mean to me in middle school, like, idolised the Plastics,\" she explains. \"I think I chose that car as a kind of rebellion against that type of girl. It was like – you guys never invited me to anything, you guys are obsessed with that car and that girl and what the Plastics wear and how they talk and you quote them all the time, but I've been working really hard every single day.\" She bangs both fists on the arms of her chair in frustration. \"And instead of going to parties I've been writing songs and playing shows and getting these really small pay cheques that have added up and now I get to buy a car – and guess which one I'm going to buy? The one that the girl you idolise has.\"\n\nIt's an illuminating insight into the points of connection that make Swift so adored by her fanbase – and also the revenge of someone who believes in narrative resolutions; not necessarily happy endings, but poetic ones. In Swift, the traditions of storytelling and confessionalism are intertwined, held together by an instinct for the universal. \"I think that all we have are our memories, and our hope for future memories,\" she smiles, her serenity restored. \"I just like to hopefully give people a soundtrack to those things.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "PRIMARY COLORS. The story behind Taylor.Swift's blockbuster \"Red,\" iand the palette of producers, songwriters, experiences and emotions used to create it\n\nBy Phil Gallo 10/22/2012\n\nTen days before the release of Taylor Swift’s fifth album, “Red,” Scott Borchetta is in “redundancy mode.” That means checking, double-checking and triple-checking every aspect of the 16 tracks on the album. Nothing about the process is musical; it’s all a case of security.\n\nEvery day that the album doesn’t leak is a victory,” says Borchetta, president/CEO of Big Machine Label Group. “It’s out in the field — it’s being manufactured, it starts shipping — so there are a lot of daily phone calls. I only sleep three or four hours a night and get back to it, adrenalized.”\n\nThe clampdown isn’t just in Borchetta’s office. People who worked on the album have been asked to not say a word until it’s released Oct. 22. Swift and her band have a string of nine TV performances during the album’s first 10 days of release, and they’re sticking to the four songs that have been prereleased on iTunes.\n\n“We’re really paranoid, knock on wood, about a leak,” Swift says, “so we don’t even go near a song that hasn’t been released. We don’t even practice them.”\n\nThe concern is understandable. “Red” sits atop a list of anticipated albums, but few are seen as so bankable, with so much potential to be the biggest seller of 2012. Indications, based on sales figures of the tracks released prior to that of “Red,” are that Swift will again have a strong out-of-the-gate performance: The lead track, “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” has sold 2.3 million downloads since it hit iTunes in late August, according to Nielsen SoundScan. “State of Grace,” released a week prior to the album, immediately shot to the top of the iTunes sales chart, pushing Swift’s “I Knew You Were Trouble” to No. 2.\n\nBeyond that, the album represents a significant transition for Swift, who ventured into multiple contemporary genres by working with seven new producers, instead of just Nathan Chapman, the composer/musician/producer who has collaborated with her regularly since her first single, “Tim McGraw,” in 2006.\n\n“On this particular record I tried to operate from an emotional place,” Taylor says during a 45-minute interview that focuses strictly on the creation of “Red.” “I made the emotion of the song a priority rather than asking, ‘What should we do from a production standpoint, or what works in this genre?’ Instead, it was, ‘What did that emotion feel like when I wrote the song?’ And whatever the answer was determined what the track sounded like and what my vocals were supposed to sound like.”\n\nSwift chose to dive head-first into dance-pop with Max Martin — who’s been crafting clubby chart-toppers from the mid-’90s (Backstreet Boys) to now (Justin Bieber) — and his frequent collaborator Shellback (Maroon 5, P!nk). Similarly, she relied on producers Butch Walker (Avril Lavigne, Fall Out Boy), Dan Wilson (Josh Groban, Weezer) and Jeff Bhasker (Kanye West, Beyonce) to steer her through sonic territory closer to their past successes than hers. Swift’s vocal performances are indeed noticeably different from track to track — “I Almost Do” and “Sad Beautiful Tragic” are decidedly country vocals; “The Lucky One” is a country-styled story-song about fame given a pop presentation; her duet with Ed Sheeran, “Everything Has Changed,” is Swift at her most plaintive.\n\nThroughout the conversation, Swift refers to the emotions behind the songs and how they drove the entire album’s creation, even if it meant less cohesiveness from track to track. “I’m 22,” she says. “I’m all over the place, so my record is all over the place. Part of this record is acknowledging [that] all these emotions are very loud and very different from one another. At one end of the spectrum you have ‘Sad Beautiful Tragic,’ which is a breakup song in the form of a funeral march, and you also have ‘Never Ever Getting Back Together’ again, which is a breakup song in the form of a parade.”\n\n\"She made a record the same way she listens to music,\" Borchetta says. \"One of the things we talked about early on was, when it's country, run toward it. When it's rock, run toward it. When it's pop, run toward it. You've got creative license; I've got your back. On Speak Now, she tried to pull everything to the middle, and that's what a pop hit will do to you. Coming off You Belong to Me' and 'Love Story'-they were so big and so loud, and they worked-you catch yourself saying, 'I can still be country and be pop.\" When Swift began work on Red (she says she started writing new songs as soon as Speak Now wrapped in 2010), her intention was to stick to the formula that had worked previously. She achieved her goal of writing all the songs by herself with Speak Now, and she repeated that process for Red, turning in 20 songs to Borchetta, who accepted them and said, \"You have an album here.\" From Swift's point of view today, there was an uneasy feeling that perhaps it was too easythat she hadn't stepped out of her comfort zone. \"I knew I wanted to stretch as a writer and learn from people I've always admired from afar,\" she says, \"but I have never been brave enough\nto sit in a studio and make music with them.\" Sessions began with Chapman producing and playing an extraordinary number of the instru- ments-yes, that's him on \"ganjo.\" But while working on the title track, Borchetta pointed out that they weren't reaching their usual standards. \"I said, 'You know, this song isn't work- ing yet. They both looked at me with a blank stare, Borchetta recalls. \"The chorus isn't elevating like it needs to. Where you're wanting to take the song, it's not going there. It needs a Max Martin type of lift. We talked about a couple different pieces, and they tried record- ing it again and didn't hit it.\" Swift, in nearly every instance, records a song or two at a time and finishes them one by one. It's rare that anything sits unfinished or that four or five tracks are created simultaneously in different sessions. \"Red\" was left incomplete, only to be revisited several months later. At that point, Borchetta called Martin. Both Swift and Borchetta agree that was the turning point for Red. Martin and Shellback embraced the idea of working with Swift and immediately suggested they write something new together. They completed four songs, three of which made the album, and the process instilled a confidence in Swift to reach out to other producers. \"I wanted to work with Jeff Bhasker because he is able to adapt to different artistswhat he does with Alicia Keys is so differ. ent from what he does with fun.,\" Swift says. \"When I reached out to Dann Huff, it's because he knows how to make a rhythm section sound like feelings. When I reached out to lacknife Lee to produce the ducts I did with Gary Lightbody from Snow Patrol, it was because I wanted to study what he does and how he made those Snow Patrol records and how he made those U2 records. I want to experience it and be around that kind of energy.\" Gut feeling. Swift says, was often her guide in choosing the producers. She brought songs to Butch Walker and began collaborating, but then worked separately with Sheeran on \"Everything Has Changed.\" \"1 immediately realized Butch would be the guy to go to to do it because he's such an artist's producer, one who lets everybody bring their own thing to the studio. I knew he would approach it from an organic place, which is where Ed comes from. I hoped-and ended up being right-that they would get along.\" Swift and Wilson wrote two songs in their two days together in Los Angeles-\"Come Back... Be Here,\" which appears on a special edition for Target stores, and \"Treacherous,\" a song that showcases Swift's vocals at their most vulnerable and emotional. On her ride to meet Wilson, Swift came up with the concept, melody and overall vibe for \"Come Back,\" he says. They finished the song by the end of the day. On day two, Swift said she wanted to write a song based on the word \"treacherous.\" \"She sketched out the melody and we were off to the races in 20 minutes,\" says Wilson, a Grammy Award winner for his songwriting work with Adele on 21 and the Dixie Chicks on Not Ready to Make Nice. \"We thought we were done, and then we decided it needed a more rocking ele- ment, so we added [another) chorus after the chorus. It was almost an afterthought, but the new section wound up defining the song.\" With the writing done, Swift asked Wil- son to produce the songs, and he reached out to Andy Thompson, a colleague from his hometown of Minneapolis to record some of the instruments. Wilson wound up using Swift's vocal from the demo recorded in Los Angeles. \"An interesting quality, objectively speaking, was how on fire she was, the clarity she had.\" Wilson recalls. \"She was so open and excited about the things I would add. She works at a very high level of positivity, and that is rare. I followed my own joy [in producing the tracks). We both had such similar visions of what the songs should sound like.\" In hindsight, Borchetta connects Swift's experiences in the studio with the Speak Now tour, specifically the cameos by guest artists from a multitude of genres, including James Taylor, Nicki Minaj. Kenny Chesney and Justin Bieber. Borchetta believes the collaborations sparked ideas about new places her music could go. \"It kind of liberated her,\" he says. Throughout the conversation, Swift refers to the emotions behind the songs and how they drove the entire album's creation, even if it meant less cohesiveness from track to track. \"I'm 22,\" she says. \"I'm all over the place, so my record is all over the place. Part of this record is acknowledging (that] all these emotions are very loud and very different from one another. At one end of the spectrum you have 'Sad Beautiful Tragic,' which is a breakup song in the form of a funeral march, and you also have 'Never Ever Getting Back Together' again, which is a breakup song in the form of a parade.\" When it came time to decide the track order. Swift had only a starting point: \"State of Grace\" and \"Begin Again\" were the bookends, as both were about a \"significant and kind of damaging relationship.\" \"I never like to put two happy songs in a row or two of the same kind of sadness in a row,\" she says. \"It's just about establishing a flow and playing it over and over again so it sounds like that's the order of things. It's a gut -feeling thing.\" Swift has certainly done well trusting her instincts. She's the reigning Billboard Woman of the Year, an honor that recognized her sales (more than 50 million digital tracks and 22 million albums at the end of 2011, according to SoundScan) and multitude of awards (Academy of Country Music and Country Music Assn. entertainer of the year; Billboard Music Awards for top country album. top Billboard 200 artist and top country artist). Since receiving the Woman of the Year honor, she's branched out elsewhere, voicing a character in the animated film \"Dr. Scuss' The borax,' hosting \"Saturday Night Live,\" acting in film (\"Valentine's Day\") and TV (\"CSI\"), and collaborating on a song for the \"Hunger Games\" soundtrack with the Civil Wars. The expanded résumé didn't hurt her day job though: “Speak Now” has sold 4.2 million copies in the United States (according to Soundscan), and the tour that followed grossed $123.7 million from 110 shows (according to Billboard Boxscore). More than 1.6 million fans came out to see her on the “Speak Now” tour, which wrapped in March in Australia. It was a highly theatrical event, one that saw Swift in numerous vignettes on a collection of elaborate sets. The tour took nearly nine months to plan, Swift says, noting that she was concerned because the set list was devised so far prior to the release of the album, before knowing which songs would be hits or fan favorites. This time, neither Borchetta nor Swift offered any details on plans for the “Red” tour, beyond a goal to not repeat the “Speak Now” shows. “I would love for there to be elements of theater on the ‘Red’ tour, and I would also like it to be even bigger and wilder than we thought before,” Swift says. “I don’t know how, but we have to come up with ideas that will surprise people, ideas that will make people feel like it was worth spending an evening with us. I’m already thinking about different ways to do that.”\n",

      "Transcript/Content": "There’s a reason why Taylor Swift has graced so many covers of DOLLY over the years - she’s one of the most down-to-earth celebs we know! From schoolyard bullies to boys who broke her heart,Taylor’s talked about it all, both in song and in her ever-candid interviews. Now, as she readies for the release of her fourth studio album, Red, Taylor shares her latest lessons in love and life.\nWhat inspired the album, Red?\n“The inspiration came mostly from the relationships in my life. Most of them were fat-paced and out of control, resulting in a lot of good and bad feelings. In my mind, that intensity looked ‘red.’”\n\nDo you have a ritual when it comes to songwriting?\n“I don’t have any specific rituals and I’ve never written two songs the same way. An idea could hit you in the middle of the night, or you might say something in a conversation that would make a great lyric. I’ve written songs in airports, tour buses, hotel rooms and on my bedroom floor. Writing songs is my way of dealing with love, feelings and relationships.\n\nWhat’s the biggest lesson you’ve learnt since the last album?\n“I’ve learnt so many lessons in the past few years. I’ve experienced great joy and great pain, and had to learn how to balance the two. I’ve learnt that love has absolutely no pattern, and no one will ever be perfect. Mostly, I’m just proud that this is the diary of my life. And I figure that if I rite songs and my life and my life is always changing, my music will be too.”\n\nHow have you stayed grounded through all the success?\n“I’ve always just figured that life will be much more enjoyable if I stick to what I love. I love music. I love my family. I love my friends. I love my fans. I love dresses and winter and cooking. I don’t necessarily love going out into noisy bars, so I don’t do it.”\n\nSo what do you get up to when you’re just hanging out?\n“My friends and I like to talk, vent and laugh about everything from life, to love, to relationships, to work. And we love coming up with activities like face painting, cooking something new, or playing games. My friends love to be spontaneous, loud and fun. That’s why I love them.”\n\nWhat’s your number one rule when it comes to friendships?\n“I think it’s important to keep friends around you who are brutally honest. It’s easy to gravitate towards the people in your life who tell you exactly what you want to hear, but that’s not always the best thing for you. If one of your friends has the nerve to tell you, ‘No, I don’t think you did the right thing,’ it can be a good thing for your character. I also don’t get caught up in trying to trying to be cool. The coolest people I know don’t care about being popular or trendy.”\n\nSo what makes Selena Gomez the ultimate BFF?\n“Selena and I are like sisters. We tell each other everything and laugh for hours about stupid inside jokes we’ve had for years. She knows my quirks and I know hers, and it's so great to have a friend who know your storyline.”\n\nSo many girls get super nervous around guys. What’s your advice for staying boy-confident?“\nMy advice about boys has to do with how you prioritize them. They can be a part of your life, but never let a boy BE your life. They can live in your world, but never make a guy your world. Knowing who you are and being independent and strong on our own will be attractive to the right guy; one of my goals is to always be OK with who I am, aside from love and boys. I love for someone who has passions that I respect and his own career. Someone who loves what they do is really attractive to me.”\n\nWhat’s the best way to deal with a broken heart?\n“When someone has affected me emotionally, the only way for my to get past i or make sense of it is to write a song. And time is a big healer too.”\n\nWhat’s your advice for someone having a touch time as school?\n“I’d tell them they’re not the only one who feels out of place. Everyone does. Also remember that the friendships you should focus on are the real ones, and that high school isn’t everything!”\n\nHow would you describe your style?\n“I would define my fashion style as feminine, retro and classic. I have so many dresses ad skirts in my closest. My favourite thing to wear is a dress. It’s my immediate go-to-piece.”\n\nWhat’s your latest DIY project?\n“My last DIY project was blackberry jam. Everyone loved it! I made labels that said things like ‘I don’t think you’re ready for this jelly’ and ‘jam session.’ And then laughed, by myself, in my kitchen.”\n\nTaylor’s Hit List\n\nForget raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens! Here are a few of Taylor’s favourite things.\n\nFragrance:“I like a daring fragrance that’s sweet-smelling with some warm tones. Right now I’m wearing my new Wonderstruck Enchanted perfume.”\n\nThing In My Pantry:“Olive oil. I use it to cook a lot of recipes.”\n\nBreakfast Cereal:“Cinnamon Toast Crunch.”\n\nBook:“The Hunger Games or To Kill a Mockingbird.”\n\nTime of Day:“Morning.”\n\nHigh School Teacher:“Mr. Schwabe, my criminal justice teacher. He used to be a Chicago police officer and told us heaps of amazing stories. It was the most exciting class I ever took.”\n\nHoliday: “Christmas.”\n\nGift I’ve Received: “My parents have a video of me getting my first guitar under the Christmas tree when I was about nine. I look PSYCHED. And it ended up being a gift that changed my life.”\n\nTV Show: “Friends.”\n\nFlower:“I love hydrangeas - they remind me of the East Coast.”\n\nPrecious Stone:“I love opals. When I was in school and didn’t have any friends, my mum used to take me to jewellery stores after school and let me look at the opals. She knew they were m y favourite, and that seeing them make me feel better. They’ll; always make me think of how wonderful she was to do that.”\n\nAnimal:“My cat, Meredith!”\n\nInspirational Quote:“It’s from one of my songs but whatever. ‘People throw rocks at things that shine.’”",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Paywall] On her coming album \"Red,\" country star Taylor Swift drew inspiration from other pop hitmakers—as well as a couple of the Kennedys.\n\nHer previous studio album, the Grammy-winning 2010 release \"Speak Now,\" sold 4.2 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and Ms. Swift made a point of writing every song herself. For \"Red,\" due in stores Tuesday, Ms. Swift collaborated with such disparate talents as Swedish producer Max Martin, British pop-folk star Ed Sheeran, and Semisonic rocker Dan Wilson, who co-wrote Adele's hit \"Someone Like You.\" The album's first single, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" has already sold more than 2.3 million copies.\n\nMr. Wilson, who has co-written songs for Pink and the Dixie Chicks, says that the most successful stars he's worked with are the same in private as they are in public. \"I've seen Taylor win on award shows and she has this amazed look on her face,\" Mr. Wilson says. \"She has the same look when she comes up with a great idea in the studio.\"\n\nMs. Swift, who has gotten widespread attention for dating 18-year-old Conor Kennedy, says that his grandparents, Robert and Ethel Kennedy, inspired \"Starlight,\" a song on her new album, after she saw an old photograph of them. \"I just kind of wrote that song from that place, not really knowing how they met or anything like that,\" Ms. Swift says.\n\nMs. Swift recently talked with The Wall Street Journal by phone about her new album. Here are some edited excerpts:\n\n\nWhy did you write with collaborators on many of the songs on this album?\n\nOn my last album I wrote all my songs on my own, and at the end of writing that record, writing songs on my own had become my comfort zone. So I thought for this new record, how do you change, how do you grow as an artist at 22 putting out your fourth record, how do you learn as much as you possibly can? And for me, getting out of my comfort zone meant getting into the studio with people I'd always admired, people who had always been influences for me but who I'd never actually worked with before.\n\nWalk me through the process of writing \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" with Max Martin and Shellback. How did it work?\n\nWell, all of the writing that I did for this record with collaborators was in person. I've never done the whole \"email me a track and I'll email you back the lyrics\" thing. I feel like there has to be some sort of a connection, you know?\n\nAt 22, do you have experiences where you think, \"I can't capture this in a song because it's too mature for my audience\"?\n\nMy audience has really become a very diverse group of people. It's not just 15-year-old girls. That's kind of what allows me to write from all the different places I want to write from.\n\nYou released country and pop versions of your single \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\" Have you gotten any blowback from country radio to your increasing success in the pop world?\n\nCountry radio has been incredibly supportive because we have such a strong relationship. I went on a radio tour when I was 16. They know that I like to explore the edges. And they also know that when I'm going to Japan and say I'm a country artist, that spreads awareness of what country music is. And so it's been amazing to make different kinds of music and still be in the genre that feels like home to me.\n\nOn \"Starlight,\" you sing about being \"on the boardwalk, summer of '45.\" What inspired that song?\n\nI get a lot of style inspiration from the 1960s, so I'll go and look at black and white pictures, and look at [photos from the] '50s and '60s, and I came across this picture of these two kids dancing at a dance. It immediately made me think of like how much fun they must have had that night. It was back in the late '40s. I ended up reading underneath that it was Ethel Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. And they were like 17 [Robert was born Nov. 20, 1925, Ethel on April 11, 1928]. So I just kind of wrote that song from that place, not really knowing how they met or anything like that. And then her daughter Rory ended up coming to a show a couple weeks later and I told her about the song and she was like, you have to meet my mom. She would love to meet you. So that was kind of what that song was about.\n\nIt does become a guessing game sometimes about who your songs are about. Are you conscious of that as you put out the album—this will get people guessing and make it that much more interesting?\n\nI don't write my albums like they're pages from gossip columns. I write records about my feelings, and my relationships and what has inspired me in the last two years, and the reality is that it goes out into the world and people play a guessing game…I don't take part in it or pay much attention to it. But I also don't sit there and say, \"Stop doing that,\" because it's human nature and people are curious.\n\nWrite to Christopher John Farley at christopher.farley@wsj.com",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift interview: 'I wrote Never Ever in 25 minutes'\nDigital Spy chats to the country singer about her new album and Ed Sheeran.\nHeadshot of Lewis CornerBy Lewis CornerPUBLISHED: 18 OCTOBER 2012\nHaving sold 22 million albums worldwide and over 50 million downloads, it's safe to label Taylor Swift one of the biggest female artists in the world today.\n\nWhat's more, the 22-year-old has managed the tricky feat of seducing the British public with her catchy blend of country-styled pop music that's made her a bonafide superstar across the globe.\n\nDigital Spy caught up with Taylor to chat about her fourth studio album Red, working with Ed Sheeran and why she's a big fan of GaGa, Rihanna and Katy Perry.\n\nCongratulations on new single 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together'. It smashed records in America upon its release; do achievements like that still surprise you?\n\"I was very surprised about the immediate success because this is my fourth album and to have the first single from my fourth album to be the most successful yet is so exciting. I can't tell you how happy I was because you want your newest thing to be your biggest.\"\n\nWhen you were writing the track did you ever think it would get the reception it did?\n\"I really didn't expect this song to be what it's turned into. I wrote it in the studio with Max Martin and Shellback and we were actually writing another song. Randomly this guy walked into the studio who I had never met before - but I heard of him through my ex - and he made some comment about how he'd heard that we were going to get back together. That was not the case! After he left I explained the story to Max and said, 'We are never ever getting back together' and someone said we should write that. I just grabbed the guitar and it just happened very randomly. It was hilarious - we wrote the song in 25 minutes.\"\n\nIs the single a good representation of the new album Red?\n\"Actually no! I don't think there's any particular song which represents this body of work because I was writing this album about very sporadic emotions. They were all on different levels from each other and so I tried to look at the songs individually and decide what each emotion would sound like.\"\n\nIs there a particular track you're most excited for fans to hear?\n\"There's a track called 'I Knew You Were Trouble'. It's about this very chaotic feeling of looking back on a relationship that absolutely broke your heart and thinking that you knew that person was bad news the first time you saw them. Now you're looking back and it's like, 'I knew it! Why didn't I listen and see those red flags?' I just ignored them.\"\n\nDo you still get nervous before a big album release?\n\"I get nervous for everything - literally everything. I'm so proud of this record and I think I know my fans well enough to know they're going to like it too. There's a lot of pressure putting an album out all over the world and hoping people everywhere like it. There's a lot of nervousness that goes on in my everyday life that I try to balance out by saying, 'It's okay, calm down, everything's going to be alright'.\"\n\nA lot of your songs deal with love and relationships; how much of it is from personal experience and how much of it is just a general view on the topic?\n\"There's a lot of both. There's part inspiration I get from my own personal life and there are bits from seeing the people around me experience things. Even sometimes watching a movie and seeing a storyline play out. A lot of it does come from first-hand experience though.\"\n\nYou've worked with Ed Sheeran on the album; how did that come about?\n\"The first time I heard Ed's music was when I was in Australia and I saw his video for 'Lego House' with Rupert Grint in it. I fell in love with his music and I couldn't believe we hadn't had his album come out in the US yet. So I reached out to his management to see if he wanted to write, but at the same time he was reaching out my management as well. So it was very strange, but I let his management know that anywhere he was on tour I'd fly there and write with him. He came to LA and we ended up writing our duet 'Everything Has Changed'.\"\n\nEd's songs can be quite dark; is this song along those lines or is it lighter?\n\"It's actually about falling in love! It's about meeting someone and all of a sudden your entire perspective on the world changes - you're thinking for two, instead of one.\"\n\nAre you a fan of British music?\n\"For me Ed is my absolute favourite, but I've always been obsessed with Florence + the Machine and that sound. But ever since Ed came out, he's been the only artist I've been listening to! His album is so good.\"\n\nWe know you're a big Nicki Minaj fan; what kind of judge on American Idol do you think she'll be?\n\"I think Nicki is a really good role model and she's always telling her fans to stay in school and keep believing in themselves. She's also got an incredibly honest opinion, so that will probably be really good. I'm interested to see it.\"\n\nIs that a role you'd ever consider doing in the future?\n\"I don't know, it's impossible to say. Right now things are just crazy and hectic. I don't have the opportunity to do side-projects like that, but you never know what might happen in the future.\"\n\nAnother congratulations for your MTV EMA nominations. You're up for five awards, so you must be pleased?\n\"I am freaking out about that! I was in the middle of hair and make-up getting ready to do an entire day of interviews and I stood up and started screaming. I need to call people and was like, 'How do I make sure this is real?!' I've always seen the list for the EMAs come out and always wished I could see my name on there just once. To get five - it was a bit of a happy, excited meltdown.\"\n\nYou have some tough competition from Rihanna, Katy Perry and Lady GaGa - are you a fan of their music?\n\"Absolutely - I'm a fan of them as musicians and as people. I really like Lady GaGa and everything she is for her fans. I love Katy because she's really funny and makes me laugh at award shows and Rihanna is one of the friendliest people I've ever met.\"\n\nSurely there must be a new tour on the horizon.\n\"I think we're going to be touring a lot. It's going to be a more extensive world tour than I've ever experienced before.\"",

(Kevin Mazur / WireImage / Getty Images)\nBy Randy Lewis, Los Angeles Times\nOct. 18, 2012 12 AM PT\nShare\nDuring the 13 months that Taylor Swift canvassed the globe on her 2011-12 “Speak Now” tour, she was joined onstage by a steady parade of celeb musician friends and admirers: Nicki Minaj and Justin Bieber in L.A., Usher in Atlanta, Brooks & Dunn’s Ronnie Dunn in her home base of Nashville, Selena Gomez and James Taylor at Madison Square Garden in New York.\n\nOn the surface, the guest appearances were simply a bonus for fans — a little something to generate extra sparks, Twitter and water cooler buzz about those shows.\n\nBut the move seems to have had an unanticipated side effect on the star — and her new album, “Red.”\n\nPHOTOS: CMA 2012 top nominees\n\n“I reached a moment in making this album where I just wanted to get into the studio with people who do things differently than I do and see how they do it,” said Swift, 22, during a recent break in rehearsals in North Hollywood. “It was really more of an experience decision. I really never want to get stuck making the same album more than once.”\n\nFOR THE RECORD:\nTaylor Swift: An Oct. 21 Taylor Swift profile said that her 2010 album “Speak Now” was the first album in more than 5 1/2 years to sell more than 1 million copies in its first week. It was the second: Lil Wayne’s “Tha Carter III” sold 1,006,000 copies in its first week in June 2008. The article also said that Swift’s “Fearless” album was the top seller of 2008, and that her recent single “We Are Never, Ever Getting Back Together” was No. 1 for two weeks on the Billboard 100 pop singles chart. “Fearless” was the biggest-selling album of 2009, and “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” logged three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 100. Additionally, the story said that Swift had received the Hal David Starlight Award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. She got that award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\n“Red,” Swift’s fourth album, is an unapologetically big pop record that opens new sonic vistas for her thanks to collaborations with pop-world heavyweights including Max Martin and his frequent songwriting and production partner Shellback, Ed Sheeran, Jeff Bhasker and Semisonic singer Dan Wilson. “Red” will be released worldwide Monday.\n\nThe new alliances manifest in the big-beat pop chorus of the album’s first single, “We Are Never, Ever Getting Back Together,” which she wrote with Martin and Shellback, who produced it. The title track, her essay on a best-of-times, worst-of-times relationship, opens over a simple banjo accompaniment but quickly kicks into rock overdrive with pounding drums and a throbbing bass line. The song “22” applies a strong dose of Auto-Tune to mechanize her vocal over what sounds like programmed electronic drums. And she’s gained considerable attention for the peppery syncopated rhythms in “I Knew You Were Trouble,” and the hints of dubstep she, Martin and Shellback weaved into her tale of yet another star-cross’d romance.\n\nTHE ENVELOPE: The Awards Insider\n\nWith only the most fleeting traces of the country music with which she launched her career, the album creatively too takes her deeper into the pop world than “Speak Now,” for which she proudly wrote all 14 songs single-handedly. It became the first album in more than 51/2 years to sell more than 1 million copies in its first week of release when it came out two years ago. It has since sold more than 4 million copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nOn the floor of the rehearsal studio, Swift displays the same fire in the belly and intense drive she exhibited at 17, shortly after the release of her 2006 debut album, “Taylor Swift.” But there’s a new authority in her voice, perhaps culled from her transition over the last half decade from a wide-eyed ingenue to one of the biggest pop stars of the new millennium.\n\nMore obvious to the outside world than all of that is the increasingly sophisticated — and refined — fashion sense she’s developed as a top-rank model and cover girl. During the rehearsal she wore a casual knit long-sleeve sweater mini-dress with black and horizontal white pinstripes, tan and brown stylized saddle shoes. The delicate gold chain around her left wrist was offset by girlish, turquoise blue nail polish. Her once curly blond hair was straight and pulled into an efficient, unfussy ponytail. The bangs scattered across her forehead framed her delicate blue eyes.\n\nPHOTOS: Celebrity portraits by The Times\n\n“One of the things I’m proudest of is that I feel like every one of the three albums I’ve put out so far stand alone in one way or another,” she said, sitting on a couch in a small room off the rehearsal hall. She’d been working with her seven-piece band and half a dozen dancers ahead of their VMA show performance of “We Are Never, Ever ...,” which that recently brought Swift her first No. 1 hit on the Billboard 100 pop singles chart.\n\n“This album does that too,” she said. “The reason being that, with ‘Speak Now,’ it was really important for me to write every song on it myself.... And for this album, it was really important for me to collaborate.”\n\n“I think the 24 guests she had on the ‘Speak Now’ tour really opened her mind to a lot of things,” said Scott Borchetta, head of Big Machine Records, the fledgling label he launched in 2006 and turned into one of the music business’ rare 21st century success stories largely on the shoulders of a 15-year-old singer-songwriter he had signed named Taylor Swift. “It really opened her mind musically and sonically.”\n\nSwift may be two months shy of 23, but she’s spent half her life writing songs, and the last eight of those doing it professionally, having landed a songwriting contract with Sony/ATV Music when she was just 14. With “Speak Now,” she set a record for the most songs by one artist to debut in the Billboard 100 pop singles chart in the same week: 10, all of which she wrote herself. She was just 20 when she was honored for her songwriting by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, the publishing rights organization, with its Hal David Starlight Award.\n\nDespite all the attention on the six collaborative tracks on “Red,” including the single, 10 remain Swift solo compositions. Thematically, “We Are Never, Ever…,” “Trouble,” “Treacherous” and “Everything Has Changed” are aligned with the songs about misfiring romances that she’s been writing since she was a doe-eyed teenager desperately seeking a happily-ever-after story ending.\n\nIn “Holy Ground” and “Begin Again,” however, she’s exploring the more nuanced relationship issues she’s encountering as an adult: in the former, recognizing her vulnerability when she’s not the one being pursued (“for the first time I had something to lose”); in the latter, she looks back with clarity on the value of a fling that didn’t work out, coming to the realization that it’s OK to be alone.\n\n“Everything Has Changed,” which she and her duet partner Sheeran co-wrote—while sitting on a trampoline in the backyard of her house in L.A., she noted—conveys the swept-away feeling of young love, and likely will lead to speculation that it’s about her current relationship with Kennedy clan scion Conor Kennedy. A more likely candidate is “Starlight,” in which Swift, who still considers Nashville her home base, sings of her 17-year-old date and telling “how we snuck into a yacht club party pretending to be a duchess and a prince.” It’s another rock ballad with an insistent Coldplay-inspired pulse.\n\n“For me, when people make speculations, I hope that they’re making speculations because they read the lyrics,” she said. “I really want people to read lyrics; I want people to care about lyrics. I think it’s important that a song is more than just a thing you can tap your foot to in the car or dance to in a club. So if them speculating about who the song is about means they’re reading my lyrics, it’s less of an irritating thing.”\n\nBecause she scored her first hit record — the savvy, country-superstar-name-checking single “Tim McGraw” — and a platinum-selling debut album while she was in high school, Swift has foregone a formal college education.\n\nBut there are the real-life credits she’s earned from creating a debut album that’s sold more than 5.2 million copies, and its successor, “Fearless,” the biggest-selling album of 2008 in any genre, which has racked up sales of more than 6.6 million copies in the U.S.\n\nIn that sense, “Red” may constitute her master’s thesis in pop music production, because she has worked and studied intensely, one on one, with experts in the field.\n\n“I wanted to know how Jeff Bhasker makes those drum sounds,” she said, fixing her eyes intently on a visitor while describing her thought process that kicked in after she’d been working for about a year on the follow-up to “Speak Now,” initially once again just using her own songs. “I wanted to watch Max Martin conceptualize a pre-chorus that gets stuck in your head as much as the chorus. I wanted to see him suggest a post-hook, or a bridge that sounds like another chorus. I wanted to see how all that unfolds.... I loved watching everybody have their own process. I think moving forward that just gives me more colors to paint with.”\n\nThis is the same voracious thirst for knowledge she exhibited early on, and that persuaded her parents, Scott and Andrea Swift, to move from Wyomissing, Pa., to Nashville with their ambitious 14-year-old daughter and her younger brother, Austin, who’s now enrolled at Vanderbilt University in the country music capital.\n\nConsequently, her aim on “Red” was to genuinely collaborate rather than simply add musical window dressing to what she’d been doing all along.\n\nCase in point: “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” reaching No. 1, for two weeks, on the Billboard 100 pop chart, one of the few commercial peaks she hadn’t yet conquered. It’s also become a bona-fide hit in England, a sign of the solidifying international appeal she’s been building for several years, a rarity for Nashville-based musicians.\n\nMeanwhile, Swift continues to be a lightning rod for attention, positive and negative. For every award she collects, such as her six Grammys including the album of the year for “Fearless” and multiple entertainer of the year accolades from the Country Music Assn. and the Academy of Country Music, she weathers withering blows from listeners and music critics who dis her vocal abilities, even her enthusiasm whenever good news comes her way.\n\n“I never have the moment where I feel like it’s too much,” she said. “But there’s definitely the moment where I get sad that I feel like sometimes people don’t believe in anything being genuine anymore. That no matter what, there’s someone questioning everything that I say or do.”\n\nShe makes no apologies for her pursuit of happiness or for her ubiquitous and oft-criticized expressions of wide-eyed, opened-mouth surprise each time she is on the receiving end of an award.\n\n“The No. 1 piece of advice other artists have given me,” she said, “is ‘Live in the moment. Really, really understand that this is amazing.’ Some of them have said, ‘I let it pass me by; I didn’t realize how great it was till after. And I acted really cool when it was all happening, and then afterward I realized I’d let it pass by.’\n\n“If you really take that advice to heart, you freak out when you win an award. If you’re really living in the moment, you’re not bored that you won an award. I got a Grammy this year, and I really tried hard not to be as excited — not to act so excited when I won. But,” she said, breaking into laughter, “I get so excited and I just was; I was really, really happy about it.”\n\nrandy.lewis@latimes.com",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: 'I want to believe in pretty lies'\nHer country-tinged pop narratives of love and romance have made her a superstar. She talks about her new album Red, the importance of fairytales – and her fear that the magic won't last\n\nAlex Macpherson Thu 18 Oct 2012 18.06 CEST\n\nWhen Taylor Swift talks about love and relationships, she dwells on them at length and in detail. \"My girlfriends and I are plagued by the idea, looking back, that [some boys] changed us,\" she muses. \"You look back and you think: I only wore black in that relationship. Or I started speaking differently. Or I started trying to act like a hipster. Or I cut off my friends and family because he wanted me to do that. It's an unfortunate problem.\"\n\nOne gets the impression that Swift, who describes herself as a \"girls' girl\", has many such conversations: the skilful way in which her music untangles the minutiae of feelings has won her the hearts of a devoted fanbase to whom she is somewhere between a best friend and a big sister – awe-inspiring, but relatable. \"She's just – perfect,\" gasps Mica, 18, one of around 30 fans – mostly teenage girls – who have gathered outside the Connaught Hotel in London in the hope of a meet-and-greet. \"It's like she knows you,\" says Megan, 16, whose favourite Swift song is Back to December – one of the most accomplished numbers in a catalogue deep in detail-rich, resonant narratives. \"There are so many emotions that you're feeling, you can get stifled by them if you're feeling them all at once,\" Swift says. \"What I try to do is take one moment – one simple, simple feeling – and expand it into three-and-a-half minutes.\"\n\nHer gift for this has ensured a seamless rise from country starlet to pop megastar. At 14, Swift began working the Nashville songwriting circuit; when she was 22, MTV declared her to be \"single-handedly keeping the [music] industry afloat\", after she easily topped Billboard's list of top money-makers in 2011. As the sales, awards and plaudits have poured in, the closest Swift's poise has come to slipping is her infamous expression of surprise when Kanye West stormed the stage at the 2009 MTV Music Video awards to protest at Swift receiving the Best Female Video award.\n\nAs a songwriter, Swift draws on familiar, even well-worn, references, but she navigates her way through cliches to bring her romances to life. The subtle shift in tense in Back to December, for instance, underlining the futility of obsessive regret; or the way in which Begin Again – the closing track on her fourth and latest album, Red – tells two stories in tandem, the shadow of the past implied in every line behind the hope of the present. \"In this moment now – capture it, remember it,\" sang Swift on 2008's Fearless – a perfect summation of her musical MO. \"I'm really intrigued by that,\" she reflects. \"Whether it's taking a photograph, or painting a picture with your words that make a song as vivid as a photograph. I've always felt music is the only way to give an instantaneous moment the feel of slow motion. To romanticise it and glorify it and give it a soundtrack and a rhythm.\"\n\nSwift's tendency to romanticise has not gone uncriticised. Detractors have accused her of everything from peddling false fairytales to young girls, to continually complaining about ex-boyfriends. She dismisses the snark curtly: \"When we're falling in love or out of it, that's when we most need a song that says how we feel. Yeah, I write a lot of songs about boys. And I'm very happy to do that.\" But what's more interesting about Swift's penchant for romance is the conflict that's underpinned it ever since she gently, sadly called it out in the very first line of her career: \"He said the way my blue eyes shine put those Georgia stars to shame that night. I said, that's a lie.\" Swift may buy into a patriarchal fantasy on Love Story, but she rejects it precisely for being a fantasy on White Horse. And the counterpoint to Swift's love of capturing moments is her obsession with impermanence and the passing of time.\n\n\"I think that one thing I'm really afraid of is … that magic doesn't last,\" she says. \"That butterflies and daydreams and love, all these things that I hold so dear, are going to leave some day. I haven't had a relationship that's lasted for ever. I only know about them starting and ending. Those are my fears. I spend a lot of time balancing between faith and disbelief.\"\n\nDoes she think the way fairytales are sold to young girls can be damaging?\n\n\"A fairytale is an interesting concept. There's 'happily ever after' at the end, but that's not a part of our world. Everything is an ongoing storyline and you're always battling the complexities of life. But what I got from fairytales, growing up, was a beautiful daydream. I'm glad I had the craziest imagination and believed in all sorts of things that don't exist.\"\n\nSwift acknowledges her propensity for sentimentalising childhood, though. \"I think there's something we have as little kids that goes away sometimes. I don't care about looking youthful for ever, but I care about seeming youthful.\" Today, Swift eventually comes down on the side of hope – but it's the vertiginous way in which escapism can crash up against reality that is the true hallmark of her music. \"I want to believe in pretty lies,\" she smiles wryly. \"But unfortunately that can lead you to write songs like the ones on my new record.\"\n\nSwift possesses a fervent faith in the power of the pop song: she reminisces about the Shania Twain songs from her childhood \"that could make you want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\"; last year, she scrawled the Bruce Springsteen lyric \"We learned more from a three-minute record than we ever learned in school\" on her arm for a live show. Now, she is a voracious pop fan. Anyone familiar with either her impromptu cover of Nicki Minaj's Super Bass last year or the Eminem cover with which she used to open her shows will be unsurprised to learn of her love of hip-hop (\"One of the things people don't really recognise about the similarities between country and hip-hop is that they're celebrations of pride in a lifestyle\"); lately, she has been researching Joni Mitchell in preparation for an as-yet-unconfirmed film role. \"She's gone through so many shades of herself,\" Swift says, admiringly.\n\nAll of this shows on Red, which finds Swift dipping a toe into waters that, for her, are hitherto uncharted: working with heavyweight pop producers and writers such as Max Martin and experimenting with slick, electronic beats. There's even a dubstep drop on I Knew You Were Trouble: remarkably, it ends up being rather amazing. Swift's line is that, following 2008's Fearless (written with a tight-knit cohort of collaborators) and 2010's Speak Now (entirely self-penned), working with established names on Red is another means of challenging herself – rather than a deliberate attempt to crack open a country-shy international market. Nonetheless, there's a trace of smugness when she declares: \"What ended up happening is, we ended up using the ideas that I brought into the studio sessions.\" Indeed, the pop sheen is limited to a handful of tracks sprinkled among more recognisably Swiftian fare: sweeping, soft-rock arrangements as the unassuming backdrop for narratives with twist endings that cast the whole song in a different light, like a subtly adjusted rearview mirror.\n\nSwift maintains a non-negotiable policy of never explicitly linking her songs to any of her various famous beaux – despite providing feverishly analysed clues in her liner notes. She views the speculation with schoolmarmish equanimity, declaring approvingly: \"It doesn't bother me when people try to deconstruct my songs – because at least they're looking at the lyrics, and paying attention to the way the story is told.\" But one of the more amusing aspects of Red is the recurring shade Swift throws at indie hipsters: it's fair to assume that it stems from firsthand experience. On her current single We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together she offers a sarcastic dismissal: \"Hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.\"\n\n\"That was the most important line of the song,\" Swift says. \"It was a relationship where I felt very critiqued and subpar. He'd listen to this music that nobody had heard of … but as soon as anyone else liked these bands, he'd drop them. I felt that was a strange way to be a music fan. And I couldn't understand why he would never say anything nice about the songs I wrote or the music I made.\"\n\nIn many ways, Swift – a \"hopeless romantic\", sincere to a fault – is the antithesis of cool; the writer Erika Villani has astutely identified this very uncoolness as the basis of many of her critics' arguments. It's long been so: Swift rattles off her favourite quotes from Mean Girls, arguably the defining teen movie of her generation, with relish, but the one time that her poise is even slightly shaken today is when she talks about the first car she bought with her earnings. It was a Lexus SC430 convertible – as owned by Regina George, ringleader of the film's bullying Plastics – an odd choice for a goody-goody like Swift?\n\n\"All the girls who were mean to me in middle school, like, idolised the Plastics,\" she explains. \"I think I chose that car as a kind of rebellion against that type of girl. It was like – you guys never invited me to anything, you guys are obsessed with that car and that girl and what the Plastics wear and how they talk and you quote them all the time, but I've been working really hard every single day.\" She bangs both fists on the arms of her chair in frustration. \"And instead of going to parties I've been writing songs and playing shows and getting these really small pay cheques that have added up and now I get to buy a car – and guess which one I'm going to buy? The one that the girl you idolise has.\"\n\nIt's an illuminating insight into the points of connection that make Swift so adored by her fanbase – and also the revenge of someone who believes in narrative resolutions; not necessarily happy endings, but poetic ones. In Swift, the traditions of storytelling and confessionalism are intertwined, held together by an instinct for the universal. \"I think that all we have are our memories, and our hope for future memories,\" she smiles, her serenity restored. \"I just like to hopefully give people a soundtrack to those things.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "For her fourth studio album, “Red,” Taylor Swift tried the collaborative approach, reaching out to producers known for their work with Katy Perry, U2 and Snow Patrol and songwriters such as Ed Sheeran and Dan Wilson, whose collaborations with Adele resulted in Grammy wins.\n\nSwift is featured on this week’s cover of Billboard. Here are some of her thoughts on the making of “Red,” the joy of being 22 and why she’ll always play her hits on tour.\n\nBillboard: How did you decide who would make a good partner in the studio?\n\nSwift: The people who inspired me were the people I reached out to. You look at someone like Ed Sheeran, who comes from such a sincere place as a writer, and his songs move you in every direction emotionally. That’s something I was so inspired by I ended up calling him. Snow Patrol are so absolutely dead-on, they can just hit you when they are singing about loss or longing. I have always been so fascinated by how (producer) Max Martin can just land a chorus. He comes at you and hits you and it’s a chorus — all caps, with exclamation points. Dan Wilson, back to his Semisonic days, has been a huge inspiration. When your inspirations become your collaborators, it becomes something really true to the music that you like.\n\nOriginally you were going to stick with your longtime collaborator, Nathan Chapman, who continues to work you. What changed?\n\nI turned in 20 songs and I had this immediate sinking feeling, this can’t be done, this can’t be it. I think the reason I said that was because I made the record exactly the same way I made the last three. I knew I hadn’t jumped out of my comfort zone, which at the time was writing alone and working with Nathan. “Red” the song was a real turning point for “Red” the album. When I wrote that song my mind started wandering to all the places we could go. If I were to think outside the box enough, go in with different people, I could learn from and have what they do rub off on me as well as have what I do rub off on them.\n\n\nTaylor Swift’s Top 10 Career Moments | ‘Red’ Track-By-Track Review\n\nThe album has songs about break-ups and your emotional condition, sometimes in the moment and sometimes from a reflective point of view. While the beats and instrumentation are different throughout “Red,” do you see a thematic link there?\n\nIt’s all the different ways that you have to say goodbye to someone. When you’re experiencing the ups and downs of a relationship, especially when you’re 22 years old, they all strike you different ways. Every different kind of missing someone, every kind of loss – it all sounds different to me. When you are missing someone, time seems to move slower and when I’m falling in love with someone, time seems to be moving faster. So I think, because time seems to move so slow when I’m sad, that’s why I spend so much time writing songs about it. It seems like I have more hours in the day.\n\nRight, you don’t write about dancing, you just dance.\n\nExactly.\n\nBut you specifically come back and sing about dancing around at your current age. Why 22?\n\nFor me, being 22 has been my favorite year of my life. I like all the possibilities of how you’re still learning, but you know enough. You still know nothing, but you know that you know nothing. You’re old enough to start planning your life, but you’re young enough to know there are so many unanswered questions. That brings about a carefree feeling that is sort of based on indecision and fear and a the same time letting lose. Being 22 has taught me so much.\n\n\n\n\nIn writing with so many people on “Red” after doing “Speak Now” solo, did you have to find multiple ways to work with collaborators or is there one way that works for you?\n\nI start all of my co-writing sessions with girl talk. I walk in and I go, “I have to tell you what I’m going through right now” and I spend 25 minutes talking about the guy that I met four months ago and how things were fine and then he lied about this and I freaked out. I haven’t been talking to him, but I really want to. I want to write a song about that feeling. And then I get out my guitar and say here’s my idea, but I wanted to give you the back story before I played you the idea.\n\n\n\nTaylor Swift Lands Nos. 1 & 2 on Revised Country Songs Chart\n\nI think the pop songs will get the most attention, but you have a few lovely ballads on “Red,” “Treacherous” and “Sad Beautiful Tragic.”\n\n“Sad Beautiful Tragic” is really close to my heart. I remember it was after a show and I was on the bus thinking about this relationship that ended months and months before. The feeling wasn’t sadness and anger or those things anymore. It was wistful loss. And so I just got my guitar and I hit on the fact that I was thinking in terms of rhyming; I rhymed magic with tragic, changed a few things and ended it with what a sad beautiful tragic love affair. I wanted to tell the story in terms of a cloudy recollection of what went wrong. It’s kind of the murky gray, looking back on something you can’t change or get back.\n\nHave you begin to think about the “Red” tour and how you will present new material?\n\nI know it will be theatrical, but different than the “Speak Now” tour. It felt like we put on a play every night. [As for material] I like when I go to a concert and the artist respects what the people’s favorite songs are. I’m going to be playing “Love Story” for the rest of my career because the fans really like it. If I ever get sick of it, I would continue to play it at my shows. You have to, as an artist, remember your experiences as a fan. And as a fan you heard the song in your bedroom, you played it over and over again, you know where the fiddle part is, you know where the banjo part is and you like the way it is sung on the record. I don’t see me altering the way my previous work sounds live because people want to hear it the way they heard it on record. I don’t need to do a jazz version of “Tim McGraw.” That being said, we’ve done some fun mash-ups. Sometimes it’s fun to weave someone else’s song into your song as a surprise. I’m always balancing — how much new material do people want to hear, how much old material — and at the end of the day I’m trying to put on a show that accurately represents where I am now.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Exclusive: Taylor Swift Talks About ‘Red,’ How to ‘Begin Again’ With New Love, and Being the World’s Best-Behaved Bad-Ass\nOur Country (NEW)        \nChris Willman\nOur Country (NEW)October 22, 2012\n\nIt's a Red-letter day for Taylor Swift fans, as her fourth studio album finally hits stores after two years of breathless waiting that made die-hard fans blue in the face. Yahoo! Music sat with Swift in Nashville to talk about the making of the album and the stories behind the massive singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" and \"Begin Again.\" Dig into the full text of our Q&A or watch the video footage to get the breakdown straight from the deeply red lips of the superstar herself...\n\nYAHOO! MUSIC: When you played the iHeartRadio Music Festival recently, you were doing mostly older songs but ended the set with \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\" And it seems like that song is such a phenomenon that it's this very rare thing: a brand new song so powerful that it could immediately become your new show-closer every night on tour, instead of \"Love Story\" or another familiar stand-by.\n\nSWIFT: I think when I played \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" live, whether it was at the VMAs or it was at iHeartRadio, it was very apparent to me that it could possibly end up being one of those songs that you close the show with. And I'm always thinking about how we're gonna portray a song live, how we're gonna put together the set list. That song is one of the biggest group sing-along songs I think I've ever gotten to put out. So it's really exiting to look out into a crowd and see that everybody is signing the words to that chorus. It's the most gratifying feeling.\n\nYAHOO!: You have that spoken-word bit in the middle of the song, and it sounds like found footage that was captured at a moment of inception in the studio, as opposed to something you came up with to stick in the song later.\n\nSWIFT: You're exactly right. I loved writing \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" because I wrote it with Max Martin and Shellback, and we were in the studio in the middle of writing a completely different song. And a guy walks into the studio who I hadn't met before but I knew was a friend of my ex-boyfriend. He was like \"Hey, so, so-and-so has been talking about you. I hear you guys are gonna get back together.\" And I was like, \"Nice to meet you, you know?\" And Max was like, \"We're in the middle of a song, bro!\" And he walks out and I just kind of went on this rant of like, \"We are never getting back together. Ever. Like, ever.\" And I explained the whole situation to Max and Shellback, and told them from beginning to end this whole up-and-down, on-and-off relationship that was exhausting... And it ended up working right after the bridge of the song, and I think it was Max's idea to just pop it in. It was one of those moments that it took the moment before we wrote the song and incorporated it into the song, so it was really exciting.\n\nYAHOO!: Was that little monologue of yours captured because someone left the mic open in the studio?\n\nSWIFT: Well, it was a voice memo on someone's iPhone. We had our phones out. When you're in a writing session, you're saying things and singing melodies that you don't remember afterward, so you have to go back and listen to 'em and say \"Oh, that second thing that you did was really cool.\" So we always had some kind of recording device going.\n\n\n\nYAHOO!: If you're doing a blindfold test on the album, you can immediately tell the difference between a Max Martin/Shellback production and a Nathan Chapman production. But given that, it coheres remarkably well...\n\nSWIFT: Oh, thank you for saying that.\n\nYAHOO!: But did you have your doubts along the way about that? There was no guarantee that your traditionally acoustically based material—however loud it ends up being after Nathan Chapman is finished with it—would mix in with the pure pop stuff that fits in perfectly with where Top 40 radio is at right now.\n\nSWIFT: When I was approaching the idea of making this album... It took two years. In the first year, I wrote a lot of things on my own and kind of produced them with Nathan the way that we always do things. And my label came to me and they said, \"You're done. This record is finished. Congratulations.\" And I looked at my label head, Scott Borchetta, and I said, \"I just don't think we are. Because I think it's good but I don't think it's different enough. And I don't think we're covering enough new ground here.\" Because this is album 4. And when you're making album 4, you have two choices: You can either do things the way that you have always done them, and then you're forming a pattern of doing things the same way, or you can switch it up and go outside your comfort zone. And for me, my comfort zone is writing songs alone. So I just thought, what if I were to indulge those curiosities that I've always had?\n\nSince I was old enough to understand what a songwriter/producer is, I've had a curiosity about how Max Martin creates what he creates. I wanted to see that happen. I wanted to be there. I wanted to learn from him. I wanted to know how Jeff Bhasker creates those drum sounds. And I wanted to be in the studio with Butch Walker and see how he creates this really organic but emotionally charged music. I wanted to understand how these people do what they do, and see people who make music in a different way than I do. So worrying about whether it was cohesive or not, whether these songs would sound like each other... I didn't want the album to have a definitive sound that was all reminiscent of each other. But the emotions I felt in the last two years were all very singular. Each one of them felt so different from every other feeling. It was very scattered all over the place. So I wanted the album to reflect how those feelings felt. And the way that the album ended up working, it ended up being a cohesive thing. It ended up working in that they all are woven with the same kind of lyrical stories. I just really like the fact that it's an eclectic blend of music.\n\nYAHOO!: Talking about the emotions of the album, it runs a pretty wide gamut, to say the least. You've always said your albums are a diary of your last two years. Back in January, a Vogue magazine came out with an interview with you saying this was going to be a \"crash and burn\" romance album. So I was expecting \"Better Than Revenge\" times ten or \"Dear John\" squared. But this is definitely not that. It has its volatile moments, but Red seems like a sweeter album than what you were promising back in that Vogue interview.\n\nSWIFT: I think that for me, the interesting part about making an album for two years is that the most amount of change happens in the last six months of it. So you're working for the first year writing songs, putting together lists, going in the studio, producing these songs. But what ends up usually happening is, that first year is like a development phase, and you usually end up scratching a bunch of the things that you did. At that point [when the Vogue interview occurred], the album was about one relationship. And then you go into year 2, and you have new experiences and learn all kinds of new lessons. And there are still some things that are very heartbroken on the record. But there are also shades of different kinds of things that I was inspired by, different layers of emotion, different levels of emotion.\n\n\nYAHOO!: In \"Begin Again,\" you sing that, prior to the moment captured in the song, for \"eight months\" you were thinking that love sucks, basically. If the record is autobiographical, we would suppose you were writing songs for the album before, during, and after that eight-month period of thinking love always breaks.\n\nSWIFT: I had many different opinions of love over the course of the last two years. And the song \"Begin Again\" came after the dust kind of settled on one of those situations I was in. it's an interesting feeling when you kind of look up from it. For the past year you've been looking back and recounting everything, just writing about it and kind of going back in time. Then all of a sudden you have this moment where you look up and look around and realize that there's something else out there for you, clearly. And I think that that kind of thing that happens where you all of a sudden have this epiphany that there's hope, that it starts over, that there's rebirth in that whole horrible crash-and-burn end of a relationship, I think that's a pretty wonderful moment. And for me that moment inspired the song \"Begin Again.\"\n\nYAHOO!: When you were being introduced at the iHeartRadio Music Festival, the actress who was introducing you first called you \"America's sweetheart,\" then moments later referred to you as a \"bad-ass.\" That's a pretty good paradox to have working for you, if it is one. But people do have these two twin images of you as lovable and so sweet, but also a tough chick who puts whatever she thinks in her songs. Do you think this album ultimately veers one way or another, toward the bad-ass or the sweetheart?\n\nSWIFT: I think that for me, my music is a way for me to get out what I don't typically say in my life. In my life, I never yell at you, and I'm never gonna actually go off on someone. But in my music, when I'm sitting there alone in my room and I can say these things that I really, truly mean, that are completely truthful, I can say them in a song. And that's for me, music has always been the way to finally have a chance to be completely 100% honest with people, even if it hurts them. And the only reason I would ever do that in a song is because someone had hurt me. But that's the part where I feel like I can rebel. You know, people are always like \"oh, you're so well-behaved.\" Its like, no: everyone has their avenues of rebellion, their venues for that. And for me, it's when I pick up my guitar. That's when I feel like all right, there's no rules here—let's go.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift tells a story painted in ‘Red’\nBy Randy Lewis\nOct. 22, 2012 12 AM PT\n\nThe promotional blitz for Taylor Swift’s fourth studio album “Red” reached its climax early Monday morning as many Walgreens and other brick-and-mortar retailers that stay open 24 hours a day took maximum advantage of the record’s Oct. 22 release date, allowing her most ardent fans to start listening that much sooner.\n\nThose who hear it from beginning to end will be reminded again that Swift, at 22, is part of a generation of young musicians who still value the album form as something more than just a repository for potential hit singles, and instead strive to create an extended experience over the course of their songs.\n\nIn the case of “Red,” the songs play out as an emotional roller coaster, which is bookended by upbeat tales of romantic discovery.\n\nIn the process of putting together a profile of Swift that appeared in Sunday’s Arts & Books section, I asked Swift how she settled on the structure of “Red,” since she has famously agonized over song sequencing for her previous three albums.\n\n“There were a few track list choices I knew I was going to make way in advance,” she said. “I knew I wanted to bookend the album with ‘State of Grace’ and ‘Begin Again’ because they’re inspired by the same person who inspired a few songs on the record. I wanted to start and end the album with the first and last song I ever wrote about that relationship.\n\n“Then in between those songs, I wanted to paint a picture of the ups and downs I’ve experienced in life and love, not necessarily in the order it happened chronologically,” Swift continued. “I like to spread the emotions out in a way that never makes you feel like there’s a sad lull, then a burst of four songs in a row about joy. At the end of the day, I make a track list based on what my gut feeling tells me.”\n\nClosing on “Begin Again,” the album sounds as if it ends on an open-ended note as Swift describes a relationship that runs deeper than many of those she’s written about in the past. As a result, the listener is left wondering where this new connection will take her.\n\n“Exactly!” she responded. “ ‘Begin Again’ is my song version of a cliffhanger ending. Throughout the whole album, there have been songs about the trials and tribulations of love and loss, and there at the end of the record it starts all over. As soon as I wrote that song, I knew exactly where I wanted to put it.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Opens Up About Bleeding ‘Red,’ Living Under a Magnifying Glass + Still Growing Up One Year at a Time\nAmanda Hensel\n\nPublished: October 22, 2012\n\nTaylor Swift is tired and a little glassy-eyed from a full day of interviews by the time we sit down to chat, but still she's warm, kind and, well, genuine. Just like she seems. We're like two girls in a coffee shop, even though we're surrounded by bright lights, cameramen, assistants, label reps -- you name it. She looks me in the eye, smiles, laughs and even compliments my dress, because despite being one of the biggest superstars on the planet, at 22 years old, Swift is still just a girl. A humble and surprisingly normal girl, who has crushes, falls in love, gets her heart broken... and writes No. 1 songs about it.\n\nEven when her earrings fall out mid-sentence -- first one, and then, oops... there goes the other! -- Swift never skips a beat, forever radiating the grace and carefree attitude that draws people to her. The 'Begin Again' singer, who has just released her fourth studio effort, 'Red,' insists to Taste of Country that while she's not a 'normal' girl, she's really a normal girl, growing up one year at a time and being 22 while she's 22, even though her face is plastered on every magazine and paparazzi wait outside her home, just waiting for her to make a misstep.\n\nSwift's new album follows a similar (and proven successful) pattern to that of her previous records, with love being the recurring theme, but it shows an obvious growth in her as a songwriter, an artist and as a person. While she's not one to name names, Swift seems to love that people speculate about her love life, and she's happy to open her heart and 'bleed red,' so to speak, as long as you're not too specific in your questions. And she truly loves love -- all of the gruesome, amazing bits of it -- because remember, Taylor Swift is genuine, and wants to connect to her audience in the most passionate, truest way possible.\n\nSo, Taylor, now that we've gotten to hear your new music… Which song on 'Red' means the most to you and why?\n\nI think for me, this album is so interesting because it's difficult to pick a song that's closest to me. Every one of these songs is a snapshot of a very different time in my life, you know? You go track-by-track, and this one's about extreme sadness, and this one's about extreme frustration, and this one's about hope! [laughs] And this one's about, you know, seeing someone and falling in love for the first time.\n\nI think that in order to pick one that to me would define the rest of the record, lyrically, it would probably be the song 'State of Grace,' because it has a line in the song that says, 'Love is a ruthless game unless you play it good and right.' And that sets the tone for the entire rest of the record -- that one lyric.\n\nWhat would you say is the bravest lyric you wrote for the record?\n\nI think that, for me, kind of the boldest song on the record is a song called 'I Knew You Were Trouble.' It's bold sonically because it sounds like that chaotic feeling of just feeling like you got tricked. And I think that… It talks about that feeling of, not shame on you, you broke my heart -- shame on me you broke my heart. I knew. I saw you and saw red flags. So, it's kind of an emotion I hadn't dealt with before.\n\nLet's talk about one that stood out to us -- 'Treacherous.' Can you tell me what inspired that song?\n\nI wrote 'Treacherous' with Dan Wilson, and we came up with a way to say, you know, 'This is dangerous and I realize that I might get hurt if I go through with this, if I move forward with you. But… but I want to.' You know? It's like that kind of conflicted feeling of it being a risk every time you fall in love -- especially with certain types of people [laughs].\n\nThat was a song that I'm really proud of, because it's got this bridge that sounds like a second chorus. It's got all these big vocals, and it's kind of the intensity of that moment when you're deciding to let yourself fall in love with someone.\n\nWhere do you go when you want to be alone? When you want to be just Taylor… by yourself.\n\nI am alone a lot, which is good. I need that time to just be alone after a long day, just decompress. So, I go to either my house or the hotel, or my apartment, or whatever -- wherever I am, I go home and I watch TV and I sit there, with my cat, and I just watch TV or go online, check my emails. It's nice to just light a candle next to your bed and like… no one's around.\n\nWhat new things do you think you've learned about yourself since 'Speak Now'?\n\nI think new things that I've learned about myself since 'Speak Now' are that love has no rules, you know? It's really just about treating people the right way or the wrong way. And if you treat people the right way, it's gonna go this way, and if you treat people the wrong way, it's gonna go this way. I think that those are the only rules.\n\nOther than that, it's just this crazy unpredictable thing. You can never, ever figure out where you're gonna end up, who you're gonna end up with, who's gonna end up being a good guy, who's gonna end up being a bad guy. It's like just this free-for-all of chaotic feelings.\n\nIf you can remember, what kind of music were you listening to most when writing this record, 'Red'?\n\nWhen I'm writing a record, I kind of don't listen to much music. Just because I want to be inspired solely on the emotion; just based on how it feels. And so, the only artists that I really listened to were Snow Patrol and Ed Sheeran, and that's the reason why I wanted to collaborate with those people on the record.\n\n\n\nRead More: Taylor Swift Opens Up About Bleeding ‘Red,’ Living Under a Magnifying Glass + Still Growing Up One Year at a Time | https://tasteofcountry.com/taylor-swift-red-interview/?utm_source=tsmclip&utm_medium=referral",

      "Transcript/Content": "ELLE Interview: Taylor Swift\nCountry-music darling Taylor Swift talks \"Oh snap!\" moments, her new album Red, and falling in love.\nby : Hudson Kathryn- Nov 19th, 2012\n\nTaylor Swift is talking about love. And her new album, Red. The two concepts seem indivisible. “Most of the songs are about very tumultuous relationships that I encountered over the past couple of years—none of them were anything mundane or normal. It was always just amazingly great or amazingly awful or just frustrating and confusing or incredible and exciting and wonderful and magnificent and magical or terrible. Nothing in between.”\n\nThat’s one of the first things the 22-year-old phenom said to me in our interview, and yet it stuck in my head even more than the catchy chorus of one of her latest singles, “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.” It stuck in my head because that’s also the perfect way to describe meeting Taylor Swift.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nMAGICAL\nLet’s start with the magic. When she breezes into the Los Angeles studio for our photo shoot, wearing a patterned sundress and oxfords, she is all smiles and hand shaking. It’s impossible not to be struck by her beauty and easy charm. Her frame, at five feet 11 inches, is lithe and graceful. Her voice lilts, and her feline eyes crinkle up at the corners when she laughs—which is often. I suspect that she wakes up looking like this, with no need to put on her face before she leaves home. Her face is just on.\n\nIt’s suddenly so clear that some people are just born to glitter onstage.\n\nVIDEO: Go behind the scenes with Taylor on our December cover shoot\n\nTaylor dishes on her beginnings and how far she has come, on the next page…\n\n0-0TAYLOR-SWIFT-1-EC1212edit.jpg\nINCREDIBLE\n\nIt’s incredible to think about where she started, though: a self-described nerd who was raised in Pennsylvania and moved to Nashville when she was an awkward teen to “make it.” Now Swift tops the\nForbes highest earners list (purportedly raking in $57 million last year alone) and is practically in need of a wheelbarrow to collect her various award statuettes onstage.\n\nAnd yet Swift seems intent on living a “normal” life. She talks about going to the grocery store or a park with the dreaminess most of us would reserve for, well, any of the stuff Swift does day to day (photo shoots!\nFamous boyfriends! Makeup and glitter!)—even if she has to walk wearing headphones so she “can’t hear the clicking” of the paparazzi.\n\n“I’m always analyzing everything, so I thought a lot about what my life might be like if this actually happened to me,” she says. “I didn’t think I’d get to still be the same person. I would watch all these\nTrue Hollywood Stories, and it seemed like a lot of people didn’t get to live the life they loved once they’d made it.”\n\nSwift seems to have been able to bring the best of her “old life” into the frenzy of fame. “When you can still just call your best friend that you had in high school and talk about the same things you used to talk about, that’s when you know it’s okay.” Or when you can call up fellow stars like pal Selena Gomez, I add. “A lot of my friends now are stylists or actresses,” she admits. “But we never end up talking shop. We’re always just talking about our lives and our feelings and our relationships and our constant, never-ending,\nperpetual mini-dramas that happen on a daily basis.”\n\nI’ve already seen that for myself.\n\n\nHow life and love inspired Taylor’s new album, Red, on the next page…\n0-0Subs-COVER-2-EC-1212.jpg\nEXCITING\n\nSwift is sitting in the makeup chair, talking into her phone at such speed that I know instantly what it is: It’s\nboy problems, man. “Shut up right now. Did he really say that?” she asks incredulously before launching into a pep talk to the likely teary chick on the other end of the line. Is it Emma Stone, I wonder? Or Selena? Or some girl from Pennsylvania? Swift flits her eyes up at me and I suddenly understand how my mom must have felt when she’d accidentally pick up the phone I monopolized throughout my teen years. Mo-\nommm, go awayyyyy.\n\nLater, though, I can’t resist talking relationships with Swift, who at this point is known as much for her romantic entanglements with men, from Joe Jonas to Jake Gyllenhaal, her broken hearts and gossipy lyrics as she is for her prodigious musical talents. (Although—side note—she’s dating Conor Kennedy and even bought a house near the famed family estate in Hyannis Port, Mass.) “I have a lot of sayings,” she adds, lighting up like a firefly. “Like, if you’re debating whether you want to break up with a guy or not, I always ask myself the simple question of ‘Do you want more or not?’ When they leave and they go home to their house, do you wish they would turn around and come back to yours? And ‘I don’t know’ usually equals no in almost any scenario. I was just talking to my friend about that today.”\n\nIt’s good advice. But, more than anything, it makes me remember the excitement of being young—before mortgages or jobs or bills made life narrower and more complicated. (Of course, Swift has all of those at this point, but I don’t think bills cause any stress.)\n\nAnd what recalls the flurry of youth more than those early\nheartbreaks—the ones that hurt so much you thought you’d die, because you had nothing to compare them to yet? On this topic, Swift is verbose. “My album is actually a little bit of a life justification for me at this point, you know?” she says, tucking her feet up underneath her. “Because when you have a relationship that does nothing but hurt you—I know you learn lessons from everything you go through in life—when you’re just reeling from the pain of loss and you’re crying with your best friends on a three-person conference call and you’re just sitting there thinking ‘Why did this person come into my life if it hurts so much to lose them?’ you can sit there and say ‘Well, I got tracks six, seven and 12 out of it.’” She must realize where this line of thought can be taken. “I mean, it’s not to say that I go out looking for bad relationships that end terribly, but they’ve produced some songs I’m really proud of.”\n\nAnd even though you’d think she has expounded every thought she’s had about love into tracks like “Our Song” and “You Belong With Me,” we slide easily into girlie chatter. She has read\nHe’s Just Not That Into You. (“I love that book.”) She thinks that when you find the right guy, “it’s not going to be a problem that you are who you are.” And I, apparently, give\nphilosophical advice like her brother. (“He’s perfect to go to for any kind of love advice because the only advice he really gives me is ‘You know there are no rules, right?’”) She calls him when her friends are out of suggestions. She’s done with tricks when it comes to dating. (“I used to do that like it was some sort of new project, like ‘This time I’m not going to text him back for 20 minutes each time he texts me.’”)\n\nBut, and excuse my repetition, I can’t fathom how she won’t eventually get tired of writing/singing/ performing songs that are quite thematically similar. “I don’t know what else I would write songs about,” she says genuinely. I suggest, only half joking, that songs about doing shots or clubbing on Friday nights do very well. She cocks her head like a glossy cocker spaniel. “I just don’t feel like writing songs about anything other than human emotions because it’s such a fascinating thing…. What else is there other than love?”\n\nTaylor chats about taking time to write Red and just having fun, on the next page…\n0-0Subs-COVER-2-EC-1212.jpg\nWONDERFUL\n\nThere is a quality about Swift that is strange—and wonderful in its oddness. She is a poised adult, and yet she’s undeniably childlike. It’s something she seems to carefully cultivate. (Innocence? Unlikely. Whimsy? Probably.) She moved out two years ago, when her friends were already sophomores in college. She tweets about her cat, Meredith, and watches “a lot of TV”—mainly crime shows that make her super-scared afterwards. And then there are the face-painting parties. “My friends and I just try to compete to paint the coolest face,” she says with a\nbright smile. “I won one time by drawing a giant squid on my friend’s face with black ink running down her neck. It was crazy. My friend can make your face look like a butterfly or draw a giant unicorn on your face.”\n\nThat is crazy. Although it does shed some light on the animal costumes donned by the band in her “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” video, which is racking up YouTube hits as I write this (27 million. No, wait, 31 million. Wait. 43 million!). But Swift doesn’t care if I think it’s odd. “When you’re little,” she explains, “you have so much fun, and it’s like, how do we lose that over the years? I think it’s by forgetting to do stuff like face painting.”\n\nAMAZINGLY GREAT\n\nFor the first time, Swift has been able to focus on recording an album, rather than squeezing writing and studio sessions into an already crammed touring schedule. “It’s been the most fun summer I’ve ever had,” she says. (Sure, we’re talking about her time spent making\nRed, but I can’t help but wonder if she’s also thinking of her time spent with the Kennedys.)\n\nIt’s easy to forget that she was the youngest songwriter Sony ever signed or that she wrote her last album entirely by herself or that she’s sold a gazillion albums. But listening to her talk about writing and collaborating for\nRed, I’m dazzled by her true\nenthusiasm for music. She riffs about Jeff Bhasker’s finesse with drum sounds, Max Martin’s gift for counter hooks and post hooks, Ed Sheeran’s brilliant understanding of chords and Gary Lightbody’s flair for ad libbing. “I wanted what they do to rub off on me,” she says unselfconsciously. “This record just kind of came together. There was less kicking and screaming and pacing.”\n\nKeep reading for why Taylor doesn’t hate her high-school bullies and her \"Oh snap!\" moments, on the next page…\n0-0TAYLOR-SWIFT-3-EC1212.jpg\nCONFUSING\n\nWe’re talking now about the cool girls who used to torment her in school—the ones who left her out and made her hate going to class. I’m expecting her to spike the conversation with a description of a justifiable eat-shit kind of showdown (she told me that those nasty girls lined up to get T-shirts signed at a concert after Swift put out her first album), but instead Swift launches into an explanation about how everyone is a victim in his or her own way, how everyone is full of fear. I tell her I don’t agree—especially when it comes to\nbullies. She forges on. “I don’t really have in-your-face moments. I’m always terrified of regretting something afterwards,” she explains. “I haven’t had an ‘Oh, snap’ moment, like running into someone who really hurt me and saying something really witty that really cuts them off at the knees. Then I’m horrible—then they’d walk away and be like ‘Wow, she was just super-mean to me; let’s go talk about her the whole car ride home.’”\n\nBut wait…\n\nIsn’t her song “Dear John” a total public “Oh, snap” to John Mayer, who reportedly\nbroke her heart? (A lyrical sampling: “Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong / Don’t you think 19’s too young / To be played by your dark, twisted games?”)\n\nMayer thought so at least, telling\nRolling Stone magazine that he was humiliated. “It made me feel terrible,” he said. “I’m pretty good at taking accountability now, and I never did anything to deserve that…. I think it’s abusing your talent to rub your hands together and go ‘Wait till he gets a load of this!’ That’s bullshit.”\n\nI gently raise this. It seems like a glaring blind spot in her “I don’t think I look good yelling at people” field. But Swift is unfazed by the contradiction. “All’s fair in music and songwriting,” she says simply. “I think that every guy who has dated me has completely known what they were signing up for—it was not written in fine print anywhere. My life ends up being music. It’s who I am.”\n\nI open my mouth, but I don’t ask the next question that comes to mind: Who are you, then?\n\nTaylor speaks on why it’s careful to think before you speak and the importance of being educated, on the next page…\n0-0TAYLOR-SWIFT-3-EC1212.jpg\nFRUSTRATING\n\nThere are clues that Swift is concentrating on saying the right things.\n\nShe queues up hip hop on the sound system for the duration of our shoot, but we’re asked by her publicist not to mention any track names. She speaks thoughtfully but with the deliberateness of someone who has been well trained to handle interviews. She makes sure to always be sugar, never spice.\n\nWhen I challenge Swift on a few issues that are more academic than\ntexting etiquette, like how her guycentric songwriting relates to feminism, she pauses. “I just write songs about how I feel about life and how I process love,” she says carefully. “I have a lot to learn about politics and feminism—all these huge incredible concepts. I want to end up being really educated about all these big topics that everyone talks about, but, I mean, it’s like baby steps, you know? And until I really form an opinion that I feel is educated, I just don’t know if I can talk about it.”\n\nIn many ways, that’s a fair response. Why speak to something you don’t understand when your words will be so public? In many other ways, though, it’s a cop-out. Swift is a modern, smart woman—she might be wonderfully whimsical, but she’s not a kid anymore.\n\nAnd then we’re back to magic. Because just when she admits to something mind-boggling, like not wanting her friends to see her\nbusiness prowess, she smiles—and I remember that nothing in life is clear-cut. Nothing except the fact that we all grow up. Talented kids become well-rounded artists and then, hopefully, wellrounded adults. But until then, we only have today. And that’s okay with Taylor Swift. “I’m loving being 22. Life has never been more magical than it is right now.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Once touted as a teen idol and a genre sensation, Taylor Swift is neither of those things today: At 22, she has become one of the biggest commercial forces in all of pop music. Her latest album, Red, sold 1.2 million copies in its first week — the highest such sales total in a decade. She spoke with NPR's Guy Raz about success, setbacks and why, in a career that began at 14, so many of her songs have dealt in love and heartbreak. Hear the radio version at the audio link on this page, and read more of their conversation below.\n\nGUY RAZ: You quote the poet Pablo Neruda right on the first page of the liner notes. The line is, \"Love is so short, forgetting is so long.\" And it seems like that line sort of sets the theme for this record.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: It really does. When I read that line, I absolutely connected to it. I felt like my favorite writers have almost musical hooks in their work, whether it's poetry or a hook at the end of a chapter that makes you want to read the next one. And I think that my favorite writers definitely have something musical about what they do, in saying something so relatable and universal and so simple.\n\nTaylor Swift, Princess Of Punk?\nYou write the vast majority of your songs, and a lot of your themes are about love or love lost and heartbreak. I sometimes wonder whether you date a lot of jerks.\n\n[Laughs.] I've written all my songs on every single one of my records, and that's what's been fun about looking back. My first album is the diary of when I was 14, 15, 16. My second album, Fearless, was from 16 to 18, and so on, and so on. So you have my life being recorded in journal entries from these two-year periods of my life since I was 16. I like to write about love and love lost because I feel like there are so many different subcategories of emotions that you can possibly delve into. I've never missed two people the same way — it's always different for me. I've never fallen in love with someone and had the same exact kind of feeling come over me. So I think that there are all these different mixtures of emotions that go into individual feelings that you feel for individual people. And, yeah, most of the time it doesn't work out.\n\nThat's the thing with love: It's going to be wrong until it's right. So you experience these different shades of wrong, and you miss the good things about those people, and you regret not seeing the red flags for the bad things about those people, but it's all a learning process. And being 22, you're kind of in a crash course with love and life and lessons and learning the hard way, and thankfully, I've been able to write about those emotions as they've affected me.\n\nIs there a line that you won't cross when it comes to writing about how you feel?\n\nI don't think that I've ever experienced that line before.\n\nSo it's really you speaking in your lyrics?\n\nYeah. I've always written songs the same way. You learn different tricks — you learn craft, you learn structure, all that — as you go. Since I was 12, I would get an idea, and that idea is either a fragment of melody and lyric mixed in, [or] maybe it's a hook. Maybe it's the first line of a song. Maybe it's a background vocal part or something, but it's like the first piece of a puzzle. And my job in writing the song and completing it is filling in all the rest of the pieces and figuring out where they go. The reason why I keep doing it is because it's like a message in a bottle. You can put this message in a bottle, throw it out into the ocean, and maybe someday, the person that you wrote that song about is going to hear it and understand exactly how you felt. I think that's what keeps drawing me to songwriting: the spontaneity of how you can get an idea at 4 in the morning or while walking through the airport, and also the fact that it's conveying a message to someone that's more real than what you had the courage to say in person.\n\nIn the liner notes, some of the letters in the lyrics are capitalized, and your fans know what that's about. These are clues for them to kind of piece things together. Do you see your lyrics as a way for you to directly communicate with your fans?\n\nThe first thing that I think about when I'm writing my lyrics is directly communicating with the person the song is about. I think what I've learned recently is that it's not ... heartbreak that inspires my songs. It's not love that inspires my songs. It's individual people that come into my life. I've had relationships with people that were really substantial and meant a lot to me, but I couldn't write a song about that person for some reason. Then again, you'll meet someone that comes into your life for two weeks and you write an entire record about them. When I first started writing songs, I was always scared that my songs were too personal — like, if I put someone's name in a song, people won't relate to it as much. But what I saw happening was, if I let my fans into my life and my feelings and what I'm going through — my vulnerabilities, my fears, my insecurities — it turns out they have all those things, too, and it kind of connects us.\n\nA lot of people know you were a talented singer as a kid, but you actually experienced setbacks for many years before you made it, right?\n\nI started out with community theater, like local theater. I loved being on stage. I loved telling a story through words and music. I actually ended up going to auditions in New York for Broadway stuff. I didn't make it there. What I ended up coming back to is, I always was just so obsessed with the storytelling in country music. Shania Twain, Faith Hill, The Dixie Chicks — I was so taken in by their songs. So I started singing their songs at karaoke contests and singing every single weekend at something, trying out singing the national anthem here or there. When I was 12, I started playing guitar and writing my own songs, and that's when it became something I could never stop thinking about. It went into overdrive. I was always singing at some coffeehouse or some singer-songwriter night or this festival or that festival. It just became everything to me when I was about 12, and that's when I started really pressuring my parents to move to Nashville.\n\nWhat motivated you? Were you just convinced you were going to make it?\n\nNo, actually. I was never convinced I was going to make it. And I look back — my mom and I reminisce about this all the time because we had no idea what we were doing. My parents bought books on what the music industry was like. They had no idea what the music industry entailed and what was involved with it. [Something that was] said to me early on was, \"Teenagers don't listen to country music. That's not the audience. The audience is a 35-year-old housewife. ... How are you going to relate to those women when you're 16 years old? You should come back when you're in your 20s.\" And I kept thinking, \"But I love country music, and I'm a teenager! There have to be more kids out there like me.\"\n\nHow do you deal with setbacks now? A few years ago, you were criticized by a few critics for a performance at the Grammy Awards. Did that shake your confidence?\n\nAbsolutely. My confidence is easy to shake. I am very well aware of all of my flaws. I am aware of all the insecurities that I have. I have a lot of voices in my head constantly telling me I can't do it. I've dealt with that my whole life. And getting up there on stage thousands of times, you're going to have off nights. And when you have an off night in front of that many people, and it's pointed out in such a public way, yeah, that gets to you. I feel like, as a songwriter, I can't develop thick skin. I cannot put up protective walls, because it's my job to feel things.\n\nThe kind of magical way that criticism has helped me is that that's another thing that I put into my music. I ended up writing a song called \"Mean\" about that experience, and about this one particular guy who would not get off my case about it. To stand up at the Grammys two years later, to sing that song and get a standing ovation for it, and to win two Grammys for that particular song, I think was the most gratifying experience I've ever had in my life.\n\nThere's one song on the new album called \"The Last Time,\" which you sing with Gary Lightbody of the band Snow Patrol, that's particularly heartbreaking. Where does that come from? You have this bright, upbeat personality and this charisma that's been written about so much, and yet there's a lot of pain in what you write about.\n\nThe idea was based on this experience I had with someone who was kind of this unreliable guy. You never know when he's going to leave, you never know when he's going to come back, but he always does come back. My visual for this song is, there's a guy on his knees sitting on the ground outside of a door. And on the other side of the door is his girlfriend, who he keeps on leaving — and he keeps coming back to her, but then he leaves again. He's saying, \"This is the last time I'm going to do this to you.\" And she's saying, \"This is the last time I'm asking you this: Don't do this again.\" And she's wondering whether to let him in, and he just wants her to give him another chance, but she doesn't know if he's going to break her heart again. It's a really fragile emotion you're dealing with when you want to love someone, but you don't know if it's smart to.\n\nThis is an election weekend, and I know that the day you turned 18, you registered to vote. You've also said that you want to wait to take public positions on issues; that you want to feel comfortable enough to defend them. Are you there yet?\n\nNo, I'm not. I think at 22, I'm still gathering information about who I am as a person. I look at a lot of people's interviews on their lives, [and] I talk to a lot of people who are older than me — I have a great respect for gray hair. A lot of people tell me that when they were 22, they thought they had it all figured out, but they didn't. Just when I start to think that I know how I feel about something, I learn something else that changes my mind. I just feel like I don't have enough wisdom about myself as a person yet to go out there and say to 20 million followers on Twitter, and these people on Facebook, and whoever else is reading whatever interview I do, \"Vote for this person.\" I know who I'm going to vote for, but I don't think that it's important for me to say it, because it will influence people one way or another. And I just want to make sure that every public decision I make is an educated one.\n\nFor most people, the time to make mistakes is when you're 22. Do you feel like, because of your public persona, you can't?\n\nI do think about it. There's not really one day that goes by that my life isn't documented somewhere. I live in a world where I know for a fact that my grandkids will get to Google what I wore today. It's a strange dilemma because it puts an amount of pressure on your every move that other 22-year-olds don't necessarily have to think about. In the grand scheme of things, I'm living a life. ... I know I'm going to make mistakes. I'm just going to try to handle those mistakes as a good person. The perception of you is going to change daily when you do what I do, but I just want to end up knowing in my heart that I did that right thing and tried my best, and if you mess up, hopefully it teaches you something.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Love Is a Battlefield, But Taylor Swift Soldiers On\nSHAWNA MALCOM NOV 25, 2012\n\nNeed a shirt with my face on it?” Taylor Swift is doing some Saturday afternoon shopping when she spots the tee, a cherry-red number that immediately takes her back to a much simpler time. “That’s from, like, my 2006 tour,” she says, running her fingers over its gently worn cotton. “That’s … awesome.”\n\nThe 22-year-old superstar loves pretty much everything about this particular Nashville shop, which sells vintage clothing, musical instruments, and a quirkily curated selection of knickknacks out of a house with a wraparound porch where customers can take a break from browsing to sit for a spell. And with Christmas approaching, it seems like a promising place to start looking for presents. “I like to get gifts that remind people I know them,” she says. “[Things] that I have a specific reason for giving them. I start thinking about it really far in advance.”\n\nIn the back room, two men’s sweaters catch her eye. “This would be baggy,” Swift says, holding up a cream, cable-knit V-neck—but she doesn’t seem to be shopping for a guy. “I’d wear it kind of off the shoulder.”\n\nWho says a girl can’t holiday-gift herself? She certainly deserves it. Swift’s fourth album, Red, is a blockbuster that moved more than 1 million copies its first week, just as her 2010 album, Speak Now, did, making her the first female artist in Nielsen SoundScan history to hit that staggering mark more than once. Released last month, the boldly personal Red earned the six-time Grammy winner some of her best reviews yet, thanks to its lyrical maturity and ambitious forays into everything from earworm pop (“We are Never Ever Getting Back Together”) to U2-esque arena rock (“State of Grace”). Swift is no longer the wide-eyed country cutie pictured on that 2006 tour T-shirt; she’s a savvy young -woman who sees no reason to be boxed in by any genre. “You have to force yourself,” she says, “to evolve.”\n\nAnd how. The onetime outsider—a songwriting savant bullied by mean girls in junior high and overlooked by the guys she crushed on has evolved into the ultimate insider, an entertainer Forbes ranked as the highest-paid celeb under 30 this year, with earnings of $57 million. She has more than 20 million Twitter followers, CoverGirl-endorsed beauty, A-list BFFs (Emma Stone and Selena Gomez), a couple of hit movies (Valentine’s Day and Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax), and a growing list of high-profile ex-boyfriends (including actors Taylor Lautner and Jake Gyllenhaal, musicians Joe Jonas and John Mayer, and, as breathlessly documented in the tabloids earlier this year, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s 18-year-old son, Conor). A performer who takes pride in being a role model, she will be honored next month by the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice & Human Rights for her commitment to social change, including advocacy against bullying and support for arts education and disaster relief.\n\nSo why can’t Swift shake the fear that she’ll somehow mess it all up? “I’m scared of this whole thing backfiring,” she says. “Or chewing me up and spitting me out, and all of a sudden, I don’t love it anymore.”\n\nShe worries so much that, naturally, she wrote a song about it. “The Lucky One,” a track from Red, tells the story of a performer who decides to walk away from stardom (“Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square”). If someday it all gets to be too much, could Swift do the same? She doesn’t yet have an answer for that, but she does know she puts “a crazy amount of pressure” on herself to keep topping her own achievements. “My head’s never really quiet,” she says. “The only time I can get it to turn off is if I watch CSI or Law & Order, where I have to follow the crime. If I can’t turn my head off during that, I know I’ve really got a problem.”\n\n“Nobody puts more pressure on Taylor than Taylor herself—in a good way,” says Liz Rose, who has cowritten a number of songs with Swift, including the Grammy-winning “White Horse” and “All Too Well” from Red. “As amazing as she is now, she was that amazing at 14,” Rose adds. “She’s just a force. There are emotions you don’t feel at 14 that you feel at 22, and her lyrics have grown with her.”\n\nDespite writing about it so prolifically, Swift claims not to know much about love. “I tend to think things are love and then look back and reevaluate,” she says. How many times has she been in love? “I know how many people I’ve said ‘I love you’ to,” she says. “I could probably count it up, but I don’t feel like it.\n\n“Part of me feels you can’t say you were truly in love if it didn’t last,” she adds. “If I end up getting married and having kids, that’s when I’ll know it’s real—because it lasted.”\n\nTrying to figure out which of Swift’s songs are about which of her relationships has become a pop culture pastime. “When the guessing game starts, it’s really funny,” says the star, who always declines to name names (although Gyllenhaal is widely believed to be Red’s central, fiery inspiration). “It’s like, off to the races! I sit back and laugh and think, ‘They’ll never know.’”\n\nSpeculation aside, Swift’s songs confirm that she has repeatedly felt burned. Blame it on the bad boys she often seems drawn to. “There’s a really interesting charisma involved,” she says of the allure. “They usually have a lot to say, and even if they don’t, they know how to look at you to say it all. I think every girl’s dream is to find a bad boy at the right time, when he wants to not be bad anymore.”\n\nShe’s the first to admit that her romances tend to develop—and end—rather swiftly. “I don’t think there’s an option for me to fall in love slowly, or at medium speed. I either do or I don’t,” says the chart topper, who calculates that her longest relationship to date lasted six months. “I don’t think it through, really, which is a good thing and a bad thing. You don’t look before you leap, which is like, ‘Yay, this is awesome! Let’s not think twice!’ And then you’re like, ‘We used to be flying. Now we’re falling. What’s happening?’” It comes with the territory when life moves as fast as it does for her, she adds. “I’m never in the same place for more than, like, three days at a time. Things can change from one minute to the next.”\n\nNot everything happens at warp speed, though: “I don’t get over people fast,” she says. Nor does she expect to settle down anytime soon. “People think I want to get married really young—I don’t know why. I’m a romantic person, but that doesn’t mean I want to miss out on being in my young 20s.”\n\nThat includes making time for fun and snacks while writing songs. According to British musician Ed Sheeran, who cowrote Red’s “Everything Has Changed” with Swift, a trampoline was central to the creative process. “We would take breaks in between lines of the song to bounce around and think of more ideas,” he recalls. “Afterward she baked an apple pie. It was wicked.”\n\nFor the most part, Swift has handled her first six years in the spotlight with a preternatural grace. In August, though, she hit a rare public relations speed bump—that Kennedy wedding incident, which she won’t discuss (“It’s been talked about enough”)—and while she claims she doesn’t read gossip about herself, she’s now all too aware that everyone else does. “I don’t know necessarily how much privacy I’m entitled to,” she says when asked about the difficulty of living in the public eye, “but I know I don’t get much of it. At the same time, I asked for this. I could be playing in a coffeehouse—I’d be happy doing that, [but] not as happy, probably. Knowing that people are going to hear the music I make is the most amazing feeling. Knowing that there are dudes waiting outside my house with cameras, hiding in bushes, is a less awesome feeling.”\n\nNo one would accuse Swift, whose parents moved the family from Wyomissing, Pa., to Nashville when she was 14 so she could pursue a music career, of being ungrateful for her success. The loss of privacy, she notes, is “a small price to pay for getting to play stadiums.” Still, there are days when she’d rather not deal with all that being Taylor Swift now entails. She travels with one or two security guards at all times because, as she puts it, “I have some crazies that are after me.” As a result, she can’t remember the last time she went anywhere by herself.\n\n“I have some days where I get frustrated,” she admits. “I kind of give myself this pep talk, like, ‘Are you in the mood for lots of social situations and pictures? If the answer’s no, stay inside.’”\n\nSometimes, just hanging at home with a little Chinese food and some crime-solving TV is exactly what she needs. “It’s just like this sense of”—she exhales deeply—“no one is watching me, no one is asking me anything. It’s calming.”\n\nMaybe one of these days Swift will get around to taking an extended break—although the mere thought turns the volume in her head up to 11. “If I took a break, would I stop writing songs so much?” she wonders.\n\nOr maybe she’d wind up having even more to write about. Who knows? She doesn’t—not yet. “I have so much to learn about life,” she says. “I know nothing compared to what I’m going to know someday.”",

So it's a love song, but it's more about getting back your self-confidence. The first inspiration came when I was on tour in Europe [in early 2011]. I'd been alone for a while and had time to think about my past experiences. But I wrote it in pieces-I'd start and then second- guess myself. I had to sort through my own insecurities.

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Wears the Pants\nTaylor Swift has proved, you don't need to wear trousers to have power.\nHeadshot of Laura Brown NOV 12, 2012 2:00 AM EST\n\nThe hitmaker is as known for her girlish dresses as for her number-one songs. But, as she has proved, you don't need to wear trousers to have power. Plus, see the evolution of Taylor Swift's best beauty looks. Photographs by Paola Kudacki. Fashion Editor: Beth Fenton.\n\nTaylor Swift Wears the Pants\n\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged that Taylor Swift loves dresses. She's loved them since she was a teenager, when she tore out a picture of Gwyneth Paltrow's pink Ralph Lauren Oscar gown from a magazine and walked around the stores at a local mall asking if they had anything like it. \"I was 15 and going to prom for the first time, and I saw that picture of Gwyneth in the pink gown,\" she recalls. \"I went all over the mall and showed it to all the store owners and said, 'Do you have anything that looks like this?' And no one did.\" She guffaws.\"So there's that. That's a sad story for you.\"\n\nSo while Taylor failed in her quest to look like the 1999 Oscar winner, when it comes to dresses she is unwavering. \"There's just something so feminine about a dress,\" she says, currently sporting a bathrobe in a Nashville photo studio. \"Whether it's a summertime dress that makes me feel carefree, an evening cocktail dress that makes me feel fancy, or a vintage dress that makes me feel like a '50s housewife—which I enjoy feeling like, for some reason—I just really like dresses.\" How many does she own? \"Hundreds. Because I'm in a predicament where I can't wear a dress twice or else it's pointed out in magazines, so\"—she starts laughing—\"unfortunately I have to shop for dresses all the time.\"\n\nToday, though, it's all about pants. Taylor hardly ever wears them, consenting to jeans in the winter only for survival reasons. That said, \"I think doing something that's different, that's out of your comfort zone is important,\" she says of posing for Bazaar in les pantalons. \"Personal growth, let's call it that.\"\n\nPants are not only supremely in style, but they are also a metaphor for Taylor. There are few young women who wear the pants more than she does. At 22, she is the highest-paid entertainer under 30; in the past year she earned $57 million, according to Forbes. She has more awards than she can count (including the MTV? Video Music Award that Kanye West wanted to re-gift), she is her own manager, and, as we know, she writes all of her songs. Taylor is so astute that she walked away from an unbeneficial development deal at 14.\n\n\"When I'm in management meetings when we're deciding my future, those decisions are left up to me,\" she explains. \"I'm the one who has to go out and fulfill all these obligations, so I should be able to choose which ones I do or not. That's the part of my life where I feel most in control.\"\n\nTaylor runs the show moneywise too, aided by her father, Scott, a financial adviser. \"I don't tend to spend a lot of money on the big things, like cars or jewelry. I'll rent a house on the beach or something, bring my girlfriends.\" (She also had a lot of beachtime this past summer on Cape Cod, at Conor Kennedy's family compound in Hyannis Port.) But Taylor is very loyal to her girl tribe, which includes Emma Stone and Selena Gomez. \"We never talk about fashion, about career, about our ambitions or our projects,\" she says of her pals. \"We just talk about relationships, feelings, love, and boys.\"\n\nRelationships—yes, she's had a few, though Taylor is happy to cede some control when dating. \"It needs to be equal. If I feel too much like I'm wearing the pants, I start to feel uncomfortable and then we break up.\" Relationships are \"the ultimate collaboration,\" she adds, but sometimes \"it's wonderful to hand over the reins to your boyfriend when you control so much of these big, high-pressure decisions, you know? That is a huge defining factor in who you choose to be with.\"\n\nWho Taylor chooses to be with is one of the world's great preoccupations. \"What I had to learn to do, in order to maintain a general happiness in my life, was to stop reading everything,\" she says, getting fired up. \"And then it gets really bad if you go through a breakup and those blogs have these polls asking, 'Who should they date next?' And you're just sitting there staring at the laptop bawling.\" She pauses. \"But you can live in a normal world where a breakup is just a breakup if you don't expose yourself to what's being speculated about yourself. That's where I live now.\"\n\nShe is, however, about to be living on a plane. Taylor is deep in promotion for her new album, Red, which is \"about the tumultuous adventures and misadventures and love and loss that I've experienced in the last two years.\" She's already had one number-one single, so next, the inevitable tour. \"I'm not used to being in a place more than two days in a row,\" she says, adding, \"I don't know if I have a vacation for another year. You get really good at maintaining phone relationships with people you love, because you're just not going to get to see them all the time.\"\n\nThere is nothing Taylor controls more, though, than her songs—a narrative of her life with a hook, a chorus, and just enough mystery to keep people guessing. And those tricky relationships will continue to be her main source of inspiration: \"Some combinations of people are toxic, you know? You have to find the right one that isn't just going to explode into fiery ash and destruction.\"\n\nBut unlike the rest of us who sit at home and eat our feelings, Taylor focuses on writing. \"Despite all of that and how unpleasant it is, as a writer you get a lot from it. It's a crazy justification system. You know that guy you really wish you could erase from your memory? But then the answer is track six, eight, 12, and 13.\"\n\nCLICK THROUGH TO SEE THE SLIDE SHOW.\n\nPictured above: Turtleneck, $1,098. Ralph Lauren Collection.

      "Transcript/Content": "The Many Insecurities of Taylor Swift\nInterview by SUSAN DOMINUS\nPublished: November 16, 2012\n\nAt the CMA awards earlier this month, Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley cracked a joke about your reported breakup with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s son Conor Kennedy. But the camera never panned to you. \n\nThey don’t pan to you if you’re not laughing.\n\nDo boyfriends ever say, “Look, whatever happens, just don’t write about me”? \nThe only time that has ever crossed someone’s mind was when we were in the process of breaking up.\n\nAnd what did you tell him? \nOf course I was like, “Oh, don’t worry, I won’t.” And then I did. Look, it’s not like it was written somewhere in the fine print that I write songs about my life. If we break up, I’m going to write about it. But I’m probably also going to write about when I fell in love with you. So there’s an upside.\n\nIn your video for “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” you are wearing big, heavy glasses and there are a bunch of guys in animal costumes. What is that about? \nYou know when you watch an indie video and you’re like: “Why are they underwater in upside- down chairs with a random projection of a butterfly interspersed? Why is this happening?” We were trying to think of ways that we could tip our hat to the randomness of some indie music videos. Why are there woodland creatures? Nobody knows. Why am I wearing floral-print pajamas? Nobody knows. Why am I randomly wearing glasses? Nobody knows.\n\nIn that song, you also make fun of the ex-boyfriend who finds peace of mind “with some indie record that’s much cooler than mine.” Do you think there’s a special circle of hell reserved for hipsters? \nThat all came out of this one relationship I was in. This guy was just, so, so cool. It kind of gave me a bit of a complex for this album, because he was always going on and on about this new band that was so cool because they were so underground. I have so many indie bands on my iPod. What I don’t really understand is the attitude that if a band is unknown, they’re good, and if they get fans, then you move on to the next band.\n\nWas that guy a musician? \nNo, he wasn’t. He just had very eclectic, sophisticated taste.\n\nA lot of your fans say the clues in your lyrics and liner notes point to your rumored ex, the actor Jake Gyllenhaal. \nI don’t talk about who it is specifically because these are real people. You try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus.\n\nSo, give me a shout out to your favorite hidden indie band. \nI haven’t been listening to that much music lately, I’ve just kind of been doing promo and sleeping.\n\nAre you afraid that people are going to think the band you name isn’t cool enough? \nIf I say something, it becomes a thing — like that’s the band she was talking about in the song.\n\nBut that’s not what I asked. \nBut that’s what people are going to say. You see how it works, being in my mind?\n\nHow is it in your mind these days? Your new album, “Red,” is setting sales records. Is it fun? \nIt’s a lot of things in there. Some days I totally appreciate everything that’s happening to me, and some days I feel everyone’s waiting for me to mess up. I’ve always been really, really aware of my insecurities, really, really aware. I never developed that thick skin that keeps you from letting things get to you.\n\nWhat are your insecurities? \nWell, I worry about a lot of things. I put out one album one week, and I’m already worried about the next one. I feel a lot of emotion throughout the course of a day. But not to the point where you need to be worried about me.\n\nYou’ve talked about Dolly Parton as being a female musician you admire. Do you think you want to stay in the business as long as she has? \nI don’t know if I could do this with the same energy, and in the same way — all the costume changes and glitter and hair and makeup all the time. When I’m in my 50s, I kind of think I’ll want to be in a garden.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift to present top gongs at the ARIA’s\n\nSUCCESS may be the best revenge for heartbreak but Taylor Swift’s lovelorn anthems have created an elite fan club of the world’s top songwriters.\n\nSwift, who is in Australia to perform at the ARIA awards on Thursday, said she sought out the world’s hitmakers to help her compose the songs for her multi-platinum smash record Red.\n\nBut it turned out they were already lining up to work with her, including Snow Patrol’s Gary Lightbody and Swedish legend Max Martin.\n\nOne of the first to approach her for a studio session was British balladeer Ed Sheeran, who has also penned songs for One Direction’s two records.\n\n”I decided I need to learn more and as a 22-year-old musician, I wanted to go and do almost like an apprenticeship with Max Martin and Shellback and Ed Sheeran and (Snow Patrol’s) Gary Lightbody,” she said.\n\n'I heard Ed's music for the first time when I was on tour in Australia last year and when I got home I told my management I wanted to write with him and it turned out Ed and I were reaching out to each other at the same time.''\n\nShe met Lightbody through the ginger-haired hitmaker.\n\n''Ed and I had hung out with my friends having jam sessions and singing Snow Patrol songs and he knew I was a huge fan.\n\n''Then one day he asks if his friend Gary could come by and Gary Lightbody came by and listened to the song Ed and I had written and he said he wanted to work on the record too.\n\n''And then I passed out.''\n\nSwift somehow manages to keep herself together and not pass out when she enters the public eye.\n\nYet she said that big smile and poised grace is practised rather than perfection.\n\n''To be honest, nothing ever really gets to feel normal about the massive amount of attention when you walk onto a red carpet, all the bright flashes and screams,'' she said.\n\n''You get better at pretending like it's normal to you but it never feels like something that is just another Wednesday.\n\n''It's always going to feel like 'Don't mess up, don't mess up, don't mess up.''\n\nSwift said she is channeling the Mad Men style of Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn in the vintage floral dresses which have become her uniform since releasing Red.\n\nBut fans can expect something with a little more bling when she rocks up to the ARIA Awards on Thursday night where she will be performing as well as presenting the major gongs.\n\nOf course there will also be a lot more red lipstick, with Swift sharing the tips on how to keep it off your teeth.\n\n''There's a trick to it. You put it on, blot one time, powder your lips and blot again, reapply the red lipstick and then cover with a tissue again and power through the tissue,'' she said.\n\n",

      "Transcript/Content": "She did it again––and there’s no oops about it. With Red, her fourth album, Taylor Swift notched her third consecutive No. 1 debut on the Billboard 200, selling more than 1.2 million copies––the best since The Eminem Show in 2002––and setting a variety of landmarks: the only female artist to ever sell more than a million first-week albums with two consecutive releases; the highest ever iTunes first-week sales (565,545 copies); the top one-week sales ever by a country artist; and the best single-week sales for Target. \nSwift also racked up sales by releasing four tracks, one each week, via iTunes before Red’s release, with each reaching No. 1 in short order. It adds to a tally that includes more than 22 million albums sold worldwide and more than 51 million digital downloads in the US, but the 22-year-old Swift hastens to point out there’s some artistic ch-ching going on here, too. Unlike 2010’s Speak Now, for which Swift wrote everything herself, the distinctively pop-focused Red finds her collaboration with the hit-making likes of Jeff Bhasker, Butch Walker, Max Martin, Shellback and Dan Wilson, as well as previous pal Dann Huff. She also duets with Ed Sheeran on “Everything Has Changed” and Snow Patrol’s Gary Lightbody on “The Last Time.” \nRed is an album whose ambitions are as big as its sales, and Swift––who again filled the set with songs drawn directly from her personal life––is counting on fans to know the material from to back when she returns to the road March 13 for the first North American leg of a planned world tour.\nMusic Connection: Your album had a huge debut. A great iTunes countdown roll-out of the songs. It’s not foreign for you to come out of the gate this strong, of course. Do you get used to it, or have to fight getting used to it?\nTaylor Swift: I never get used to that. I don’t naturally feel like I am entitled to win. I don’t naturally feel like if I put out a song it will go to number one in hours. It’s like I got so used to having to fight to get the song up the charts and having to wait and having to hope that people would hear it, that’s kind of where my mind stayed. And so when we have something like this album, where all the songs that we put out on the iTunes countdown have gone to number one, it is absolutely mind-blowing to me that the fans are that reactive and that they’re that fast and that there are that many of them who are so clued-in. It’s something that I’m never going to get used to. I can’t imagine getting used to it.\nMC: The iTunes countdown for the new songs was an interesting way to roll things out. What was it like to watch it happen?\nSwift: It’s so exciting to reveal, track by track, songs that are so different from each other and kind of keep people on their toes about what could possibly be coming next.\n“I feel like at 22, I’m still very much a student of music and on my way to where I’m going to end up someday. But along the way it’s really fun to take risks because you look at some careers and you see people make the same album twice, and I never want to do that” \nMC: Red is your fourth album. You’ve been through the big debut, the follow-up to show it was no fluke and then the third one. What does a fourth album mean?\nSwift: Actually, the way I kind of categorize them is like the first one came out and some people noticed and we were really lucky and it sold millions of copies, but I hadn’t had anything cross over. So the second album, for me, felt like a breakthrough, and then it felt like the third album was to prove that it wasn’t a fluke.\nMC:  Which makes this one…?\nSwift: This one is for the sake of adventure. I think I try to veer away from whatever comfort zone I developed in making my last record, and for my last record, Speak Now, my comfort zone became writing songs alone. It just became what I fell back on and what I always did and just kind of felt like what I naturally gravitated towards.\nThis time I wanted  to challenge myself as a writer. I wanted to challenge myself as an artist. So I called up a bunch of people that I admired in the songwriting-producing artists world, and I just wanted to see if they would work with me and collaborate. It was such an educational and amazing, adventurous experience being in the studio with people who I had always admired and people who make music that’s different from the kind of music I make, so you have a blending of two worlds.\nMC: Did you have a hit list? What was the criteria for the kind of folks you wanted to work with?\nSwift: Well, I would come up with an idea and I’d think, “What do I want the production for this to sound like?” and a name would just pop into my head. I’d come up with like a partial idea for a song and I’d think Dan Wilson. Or, “Jeff Bhasker would nail the drums on this.” Or, “Max Martin would kill this.” And I’d bring them those ideas, and that’s kind of how it worked. I had a short list of people that I’ve been admiring for years, not only because of being a fan of what they do but being a fan of their ability to adapt and change. Jack Bhasker produces fun., but he also has done some amazing stuff for Alicia Keys, and it’s all different sounding––the same way that Max really reinvents himself all the time.\nMC: Let’s hear about the Swedish adventure with Max and Shellback, since we heard “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” right  out of the box. What was it like working with those guys?\nSwift: Working with Max and Shellback was such an exhilarating experience as a writer, because they’re so in the moment and they’re so present and they’re so excited, and that’s exactly how I am. So you get us all in a room and it’s just like an immediate green light. We just start writing and we don’t stop and we would write several songs a day. I love to work fast, and I love to work with people who love making music. When there’s that level of excitement in the room it makes me so excited to get up and go in the studio with them the next day. It’s just like, “What are we going to do tomorrow?!”\nMC: How early did you nail “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” with them?\nSwift: We wrote a few songs before that, and that was the song that we really kind of realized, “We’re on to something here.” And from that point we wrote two other songs that ended up making the record.\nMC: Tell me about one of those, “I Knew You Were Trouble.”\nSwift: The song is about an experience where I knew that this guy was going to be bad news the first time I saw him, and I had all these red flags pop up and I ignored all of them and I believed him anyway and fell for and ended up brokenhearted like I knew I was going to. But instead of thinking, “Shame on you, you broke my heart,” I actually ended up feeling like “shame on ME, I let you break my heart. I knew you were gonna do that!” You know? It’s kind of an interesting feeling when you realize that you’ve already learned this lesson and you just ignored all of the common sense that you’ve gathered up to this point.\nMC: You’ve never been shy about taking care of the guys who done you wrong in song, have you?\nSwift: Writing about my life…helps me figure out how I feel about things sometimes. Emotions can be so messy and all over the place, and you can feel so many different emotions about one thing. So when I write a song on how I feel about that certain thing, it becomes simple and I can really process it and I can feel like whatever pain that situation may have brought me in my life was worthwhile and justified because it was supposed to come out in a song.\nMC: So what are you going to do when you land “the one,” the one that lasts for a long time? What’s going to happen to the songwriting?\nSwift: (laughs) I don’t know. I mean, I think that there’s no emotion that’s simple, not even an everlasting emotion. Not even unconditional love. There are undertones to every emotion. I’ve learned that. I think that one thing I tend to do is go back to a feeling––something I used to feel or something I felt for someone who I don’t know anymore and kind of the sadness of it––and revisit it. At the same time I get inspired by seeing my friends’ relationships. I get inspired by watching movies and thinking, “What kind of soundtrack would this moment have?” So I don’t quite know what will happen if I end up actually reaching the state of general happiness when it comes to love, but I hope that I can draw inspiration from all sorts of places.\n“I try to operate on an emotional basis, which to me meant taking the general emotion I was feeling, writing lyrics that I felt depicted it and choosing production that I felt painted the picture even more.”\nMC: You of course write personally. Do you find this time out that you found yourself writing personally in a different way? What do you find in the evolution and the creative growth of mining those emotions and turning them into songs?\nSwift: For me what comes a little easier now is the first thing that you get when you get an idea for a song, the first little fragment. It’s like a puzzle piece, right? And you have to then choose where it’s going to go in the grand scheme of the song: “Okay, this idea I just got, is it a pre-chorus? Is it a post hook? Is it a first line?” And I think that what the craft of songwriting teaches you how to do is to take that spurt of inspiration and figure out where that puzzle piece goes and how to build out from it and create the rest of the puzzle to be as interesting as that initial idea.”\nMC: How did you wind up with Ed Sheeran on “Everything Has Changed”?\nSwift: Ed and I became fast friends as soon as we wrote together. We have very similar processes; we both love to grab a guitar and ad lib, and whatever comes out some of it ends up in the song and you go back and re-evaluate it and look at every lyric and edit it. I really love working with someone who writes in a similar way. And he’s also just really cool to hang out with. My friends and I love him, and he is someone that I’m so honored to have on the record. The song is a duet, so hearing his voice come on my album  it feels really special.\nMC: He’s a little kooky, though, isn’t he?\nSwift: Well…aren’t we all? With him it’s childlike. There’s this kind of childlike energy about Ed, because he’s got such an amazing imagination, and that’s so fun to be around.\nMC: What do you consider to be the general tenor of the album? It seems to take you into more of a mainstream pop direction than you’ve gone before.\nSwift: The album has 16 songs on it, and to say that it’s eclectic would be pretty dead-on because track-to-track there’s nothing that sounds like anything else on the record. It was definitely an opportunity for me to push the limits and paint with different colors. I try to operate on an emotional basis, which to me meant taking the general emotion I was feeling, writing lyrics that I felt depicted it and choosing production that I felt painted the picture even more.\nSo if you are dealing with a really chaotic emotion, like “I Knew You Were Trouble,” I wanted it to be a chaotic, intense, emotional sounding song. I wanted it to match the lyric.\nMC: Is there anything that felt completely left field to you on Red?\nSwift: I think that there are so many influences that I have. I am such a music fan, and that’s why you see me doing collaborations with B.o.B. and then the next month doing a collaboration with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett for The Hunger Games soundtrack. I love getting to be a part of this musical world where it’s possible to learn from people like that or from, say, Max Martin or Dann Huff. I feel like, at 22, I’m still very much a student of music and on my way to where I’m going to end up someday. But along the way it’s really fun to take risks because you look at some careers and you see people make the same album twice, and I never want to do that.\nMC: You have a tour coming up in 2013. How are you approaching that?\nSwift: I am so excited to see what songs the fans like the most because that’s the first step. We always see which songs are really the passionate songs and the ones the fans are freaking out over the most, and those are the ones that are definitely in the set list. And, of course, you know the tour will be a big representation of this record. But you know it will be really amazing to see which ones jump to the forefront.\nMC: You’re mixing up arenas and stadiums again. Do you have a preference?\nSwift: Well, I like for it to be big––as big as possible. I just want to be able, in this economy, to make a show that will be entertaining enough to warrant the fans leaving their house, spending their evening with me, parking their car, waiting in line, maybe buy a T-shirt. I want them to be so happy that they decided to spend their time with me––I think that’s my biggest objective. And the element of surprise is still really important in a concert, and showing scenes and images and visuals that are magical. I really like to take people to a different world and change things up constantly, never showing them too much of the same thing too many times in a row.",

And she says that her fans — who have purchased 1.55 million copies of “Red” since its October 22 release, according to Nielsen SoundScan — will have everything to do with what she plays.\n\n“Of course, you know the tour will be a big representation of this record,” Swift tells Billboard. “I’m so excited to see what songs the fans like the most and which ones jump to the forefront, because that’s the first step. We always see which songs are really the passionate songs and the ones the fans are freaking out over the most, and those are the ones that are definitely in the set list. I can’t wait for that.”\n\nTickets begin going on sale Nov. 16 for Swift’s 58-date trek, which will be stopping at mostly arenas and nine stadiums on the tour and is currently announced through Sept. 21 with British troubadour Ed Sheeran, who guests on the “Red” track “Everything Has Changed,” as the opening act. And Swift says she’s planning a production that will fit the scale of the places she’s playing.\n\n“I like for it to be big — as big as possible,” Swift explains. “If we can make a show that dazzles people more than the last tour, then I’ll have done my job in the right way. I just want to be able, in this economy, to make a show that for fans is definitely a guarantee that they will be entertained enough to warrant them leaving their house, spending their evening with me, parking their car, waiting in line, maybe buy a T-shirt. I want them to be so happy that they decided to spend their time with me — I think that’s my biggest objective. And the element of surprise is still really important in a concert and showing scenes and images and visuals that are magical. I really like to take people to a different world and change things up constantly, never showing them too much of the same thing too many times in a row.”\n\nSwift’s Speak Now World Tour grossed more than $123 million and played to more than 1.6 million fans during 2010-2011, and “Red’s” success so far certainly bodes well for strong ticket sales for the tour. Nevertheless, Swift contends that she’s not taking anything for granted.\n\n“I don’t naturally feel like I am entitled to win,” Swift says. “If I put out a song I don’t expect it to go No. 1 within hours. I got used to having to fight to get the song up the charts and having to wait and having to hope people would hear it; that’s kind of where my mind stayed. And so when we have something like (‘Red’), where all the songs that we’ve put out…have all gone to No. 1, it is absolutely mind-blowing to me that the fans are that reactive and that they’re that fast and that there are that many of them who are so clued in. It’s not something that I’m ever going to get used to.”\n\nSwift’s episode of “VH1 Storytellers” is currently airing, and she’s also lined up performances on “The X Factor” (Nov. 15) and the American Music Awards (Nov. 18). She’s co-hosting “The Grammy Nominations Concert Live!! — Countdown to Music’s Biggest Night” Dec. 5 on CBS and will perform in New York City’s Times Square as part of “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve” on ABC.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift sold so many records in 2012, the only people who didn't buy one are probably named Jake and John. Her fourth album, Red, is yet another blockbuster, selling 1.2 million copies in its first week, far outpacing every other week-one sales tally for 2012. (Mumford & Sons' Babel placed a distant second with 600,000). But Red is far from a safe record for Swift. She stretched her sound by co-writing with Swedish hit mafia Max Martin and Shellback and dueting with moon-eyed British folkies Ed Sheeran and Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody, and tackled assorted adult subjects with the same precision she previously saved for high-school crushes. Don't let the off-white sundresses and kitty-cat Instagrams fool you. At 22, Swift is clearly no innocent: She's in charge of her career to a degree that few artists can dare match, and she's an exceptional songwriter who still hasn't peaked at her craft. We spoke to Swift by telephone while she was in Los Angeles for a TV appearance and video shoot.\n\nMy year was more like a two-year process, actually, culminating in a surprisingly pleasant reception for Red.\n\nWhy surprisingly pleasant?\nI had a lot of fears that people wouldn't like me stepping out of boxes and allowing all of my musical influences to show. I had so much fun making this record, but I often feel like when things are too much fun, how can they turn out well?\n\nDo you typically think that way? If things are going well there must be another shoe about to drop?\nI always feel like there must be another shoe about to drop, the ceiling must be about to cave in, the floor must be about to drop out from under me. That’s why I'm so grateful for good times. I was sitting at the kitchen table talking to my mom last night and I was like, \"I'm so content right now. How am I this content?\" I've learned to value those moments when my life feels balanced, when everything that I've put forth musically has been completely understood by my fans.\n\nIt must be nice that you can talk to your mom that way.\nOh yeah, my mom and I have a really, really close relationship. She’s the main reason I've been able to find a center emotionally. Because I do deal with a lot of anxiety—not crawl-up-in-a-ball-and-rock-back-and-forth anxiety, but doubts and insecurity, about everything. And I try to be as self-aware as possible, which ends up making me question things. So to get back to your original question, I guess the way that I would describe this year is that all of my hopes and dreams about this album came true, surprisingly to me. [laughs]\n\n\nWould you describe yourself as an anxious person?\nI wouldn't say so, no, but I've watched so many people's lives and careers and read so many stories and biographies that I never want to make that crucial mistake that starts you on that downward spiral. I always want to be super self-aware about where I am in life, work hard, and try to do the right thing. And sometimes when you’re trying to do all those things, it can make you kind of nervous. But I also really like to have fun and hang out with my friends. I love living a life that I can then write about. You have to have magic in your life if you're going to write about it.\n\nYou exert an enormous amount of control over your career for such a young artist. Do you come to decisions easily, or do you worry them to death?\nI'm decisive about big, important decisions: about my career, my album, what single's coming next, what cover image is going to be on the album, where we're going to tour. Things like that. What I'm not decisive about is where to go eat dinner tonight or what to order. I always let my friends choose where we're going to go, because today I decided where I'm going to be for the next two years of my life.\n\nWhat does Red says about who you are right now? What clues does it give about the person you've become?\nThis record is really bold and risky for me, especially sonically. It says that I'm much more willing to take chances at this point in my life. All for the sake of really living, for the sake of learning as much as I can and taking a chance on something knowing it could be dangerous.\n\nIs that true in your personal life as well as your professional life?\nAbsolutely. At 22, I'm just trying to live a magical life, and part of that is excitement. Twenty-two is an age where people say, \"Go out and make your mistakes! Live your life! You're young!\" I know that I can't live that way completely because everything I do is documented and speculated on, but I still want my life to be spontaneous. I don’t want my life mapped out for me. I want some uncertainty. That's both exciting and scary to me, and I like living in that place right now.\n\nIf your life was the basis for a rom-com, there'd be the scene where the famous singer sneaks away from her handlers and has some little adventure that she's not supposed to have, to prove that she still can do that kind of thing. Do you ever feel the need to do that?\nThe fun thing about my life is that I don't have any babysitters. Like, if I wanted to go out clubbing tonight and stay out all night every night for the rest of this month, no one would tell me not to.\n\nDo it!\nIt's just that I don’t really feel like it!\n\nYou appear to be an almost infuriatingly well-raised, well-grounded person.\nI feel like because I was signed to an indie label [Big Machine] and was able to make all my own creative decisions—write songs with whom I wanted to write, pick which songs ended up on the record, pick the singles, pick what I wear, what events I go to, where I perform and what I perform and how I perform—when you're given that much freedom there's not that much to rebel against.\n\nThat's an interesting point. But you must hang out with a lot of young musicians and actors who have the complete opposite professional life from you, where every move they make is essentially plotted for them. Do they sometimes seek you out for career advice?\nWell, my girlfriends who are in music or acting, when we hang out we do not talk shop. We just talk about relationship stuff and our lives. It's funny, because I have no idea what movies my friends are working on right now. I just know that when they get off work, they come over and we have dinner and talk about, you know, what we did last weekend.\n\nHow do you think you've changed and developed as a singer?\nListening back to my old records is interesting for me. Even watching old interviews is weird, because I've been putting out records since I was 16. My speaking voice is different from 16 to 18 to 20 to 22. And my singing voice is sooo different. I think that from touring year after year you develop muscles that you didn’t have before, you develop confidence that you didn’t have before. It’s still is an effort not to get nerved out at awards shows. Everybody deals with that to some degree. But over time I've gotten more and more confident as a performer.\n\nWhen you say your speaking voice has changed, have you lost your twang?\nI think I talk how my friends talk. When I first moved to Nashville I was hanging out with all these kids with Southern accents, and I'd say \"y'all\" more and stuff like that. And now, I don’t know, I travel the world and I've developed my own way of talking.\n\nIs there a lyric on Red you’re especially proud of?\nThe lyric I’m most proud of is from \"All Too Well\": \"And you call me up again just to break me like a promise / so casually cruel in the name of being honest.\" That was something I came up with while ranting during a soundcheck. I was just playing these chords over and over onstage and my band joined in and I went on a rant. Those were some of the lines I thought of.\n\nWho were you ranting at?\nHmm. I was going through a really hard time then, and my band joined in playing, and one of the first things that I came up with, just, like, spat out, was \"And you call me up again just to break me like a promise, so casually cruel in the name of being honest.\"\n\nThat's a tough line.\n[Laughs] It's very... pointed.\n\nHow does writing with other people compare with writing by yourself? Is writing with others a very intimate experience?\nEvery cowriter is a different scenario, but they all start out with the same thing. I come in with a musical idea and I'll play it for them on the guitar. But before that, I'll tell them, for about 20 minutes, exactly why I want to write that and what I'm going through and why this guy did this and how it made me feel and when I met him and how I haven't talked to him in 13 days and why I feel this and that. [laughs] And then I'll play them the idea and say, \"Do you want to work on this?\" And if they say yes then we write that song.\n\nSo you do have to lay yourself bare a bit.\nI like to. If I'm going to write with someone, I want them to know that I trust them, that I trust them to know what I'm going through so they can get into my head and help me convey my thoughts in the most honest way possible. If I'm going to write with you, you're going to know the ins and the outs of how I've been feeling lately. \n\nSome 2012-related questions: Did you vote in this year's presidential election?\nYes, but I had to file an absentee ballot because I was in London.\n\nYou don't have to say who you voted for, but by any chance does it rhyme with Shmarack Shmobama?\nI never talk about politics. Like, strict rule, I just don't, because I don’t think it's my place to.\n\nDid you take anything away from the results of the election?\nI’m sorry, I just don’t talk politics. Politics and religion. It's kind of like being at a dinner party. I feel that at 22 I really shouldn't be proclaiming what I think politically. I'm a singer, and I think that's what people want to see me stick to. When I'm older and wiser and I'm more read-up on things, maybe then I'll voice my political opinions.\n\nHave you seen the TV show Nashville?\nI've only seen the pilot.\n\nHow come only that one episode?\nI've been busy!\n\nFair enough. Have you binged on any other TV shows this year?\nWell, the Law & Order: SVU marathons are always on. That's where I find my solace.\n\nThey are a constant presence in all our lives.\nOlivia Benson is always there when we need her.\n\nLast book you read?\nLast book I read... the last book I read was Girls Like Us [Sheila Weller’s best-selling biography of Carole King, Carly Simon and Joni Mitchell; Swift is rumored to be playing Mitchell in the movie adaptation].\n\nDid you read 50 Shades of Grey?\n[Laughs] No, I didn't.\n\nWhat were your favorite songs of 2012?\n\"Lego House\" by Ed Sheeran, and, hmm... \"Anything Could Happen\" by Ellie Goulding.\n\nBoth are very melancholy, rainy-day Brits...\nYeah, I get into that thing, for sure. Let me think, what else... I'm actually going through my playlists right now. Ooh! \"Madness\" by Muse. That song's so good.\n\nYou grew up in a very stable, financially secure household. When you meet artists whose backgrounds are much different than yours—harder, more unsettled—do you ever think, wow, these people have such different material to draw from than me?\nI've never looked at my life and thought, I wish I could write about having different circumstances. And if I want to jump into a character, I'll do something like my song for the Hunger Games soundtrack. When the Hunger Games people came to me and said \"we want you to write from Katniss’ perspective,\" it was really crazy to read that book, jump into her skin, and to have a whole different set of hopes and fears in front of me.\n\nWould you like to do more of that kind of role-playing in your songwriting?\nThere are endless possibilities of where I could take the narrative of what I do. I haven't started to conceptualize what the next record will be, but there are always ideas that I have flying around. I guess I'll just try each one out until I find something that fits.",

Even more surprising was his reason why.\n\n\"I would say I would avoid Taylor Swift, because she's dating one of my friends. She's going out with Harry Styles. So Harry, I couldn't obviously go near Taylor because that's his missus.\"\n\nLooks like Haylor is real!\n\nMurs weighed in on the other ladies as well, first debating whether or not to kiss P!nk or Florence.

Give her a cheeky snog.\"\n\nThat leaves P!nk as Olly's future wife.

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift's Nashville Favorites\nOur Q&A with gifted country music artist, Taylor Swift. (Dec 2012)\n\nby Nashville Lifestyles December 13, 2012 6:00 AM\n\nNL: How does it feel to have your own place in Midtown Nashville? \nTS: I love living in Midtown. In 10 minutes, I can walk to Hillsboro Village through the Vanderbilt campus, past the gorgeous old stone buildings and churches. I love being so close to Green Hills and the Gulch and Broadway. Everything is two minutes away.\n\nNL: What’s your favorite thing about owning and having your own place? \nTS: My favorite thing is getting to have my friends over and cook for them. Hanging out with friends at home always turns into some piano sing-along, so I have all kinds of percussion instruments and guitars lying around. Also, living in an apartment  motivates you to get out and get things done during the day. Something about living up in the sky, being able to see the whole city going about its day, makes you want to get up early and go accomplish things.\n\nNL: If you had a day to be anonymous in Music City, what would you do and where would you go?\nTS: I’d just probably do the same things I usually do. It would be so depressing to think I couldn’t go certain places because people know who I am now. I love going to the shops in Franklin and walking around the adorable areas in East Nashville (my fiddle player Caitlin’s neighborhood) and walking toStarbucks in the morning. I love concerts at the Ryman, I like going to Target. These are all places where there are always lots of people around, but that’s just kind of where I like going. It’s not that big of a deal, really.\n\nNL: Your top choices for a great meal in the city and what you order?\nTS: Fido in Hillsboro Village—I like it for its atmosphere and energy. Everybody’s always hanging out there, having lattes in mugs with cute little swirl designs on top. My friends and I like it because it’s open late. Capitol Grille in the Hermitage Hotel—I took my parents there for Mother’s Day this year, and it had this old school, back-in-time vibe to it. Sometimes I think every restaurant is trying to out-hip the others—this one is really classic, and my brother and I were geeking out about the history of the Hermitage Hotel. Tokyo in Green Hills—This place has a deck to sit outside and hibachi tables inside. The waiters and waitresses are so sweet and friendly.\n\nNL: Do you have any favorite shops in or around Nashville? If so, any tips for great finds? \nTS: I have so many favorite shops here. I love Gilchrist and Gilchrist, this family owned shop in Berry Hill. I bought a lot of cute decorations and furniture for my apartment there. For the girls who like shabby chic, go there. I really like the Hill Center area with Anthropologie and H.Audrey. Fire Finchand Pangaea in Hillsboro Village are so cute too. Fanny’s House of Music in East Nashville has instruments, lessons, sweet ladies who work there and awesome vintage clothes, shoes, and accessories (across the street is Pied Piper, get some ice cream there).",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Original Link is in German] Lucky Child\nTaylor Swift is currently really taking off in Europe. She was the big winner at the MTV Europe Music Awards with three trophies. It's not just musically that she's on the rise. Her first self-created perfume, 'Wonderstruck', is also well received by her fans. We met the American singer for an interview and talked to her about her fragrance, her favorite make-up and the perfect day\n\nWe meet Taylor Swift in the library at Bensberg Castle. Her look fits in well with the setting. She is wearing a dark checked dress and looks almost like a college student. Her hair is side-swept in light waves, her bangs are straightened. Taylor Swift looks at us with large, darkly made-up cat eyes. She is in a good mood, she had her 23rd birthday the day before...\n\nGLAMOUR: Happy belated birthday, Taylor! How did you celebrate your birthday?\n\nTaylor Swift: I was in England and celebrated with some really lovely people. I also found out there that I was nominated for a Golden Globe for a song I wrote for Hunger Games. Unbelievable news! And then my new music video was shown for the first time on MTV, which I am so proud of. The song is called \"I knew you were trouble\". My birthday couldn't have been more exciting.\n\nGLAMOUR: Would you describe him as perfect?\n\nTaylor Swift: Pretty much. It was probably the best birthday I've had since I was about six years old.\n\nGLAMOUR: You always look wonderful. How do you do it?\n\nTaylor Swift: I think it's important to let your skin breathe. Often, when I have a day off, I don't wear any makeup at all. And when I do wear makeup, I prefer to use a tinted moisturizer instead of a regular foundation. I think it's better for your skin. One of my favorites is definitely Kiehl's.\n\nGLAMOUR: And if you really want to put yourself in the spotlight?\n\nTaylor Swift: Then I always use a black eyeliner and a good red lipstick. The eyeliner is called 'LineExact Liquid Liner' by Covergirl, it looks like a felt-tip pen and is really easy to apply. My favorite lipstick is 'Hot' by Covergirl.  \n\nGLAMOUR: What other beauty products can you find in your handbag?\n\nTaylor Swift: Definitely lip balm and perfume. I keep all my perfume samples in my handbag. I get them all from Elizabeth Arden, who we work with.\n\nGLAMOUR: … like your perfume 'Wonderstruck'. What do you associate with the scent?\n\nTaylor Swift:  'Wonderstruck' describes the feeling when you meet someone for the first time. It invites you to dream about how this encounter might develop. It's a really sweet scent.\n\nGLAMOUR: How did it feel to create a perfume?\n\nTaylor Swift: It was amazing how many different processes are needed to produce a perfume. You have to create the scent, come up with a name, take photos, design the bottle, design the packaging and so on. There is a lot of planning and decision-making involved. It was a lot of fun to be part of this process.\n\nGLAMOUR: You often change your look. Sometimes you style your hair in wild curls, sometimes completely straightened.\n\nTaylor Swift: I like to play with different styles. At the moment, I like the look I'm wearing today the most: sleek, light waves and straightened bangs. It's simply timeless.  \n\nGLAMOUR: What do you do on bad hair days?\n\nTaylor Swift: I either hide my hair under a hat or I put my hair in a ponytail. That always works.\n\nGLAMOUR: Do you have a lucky charm?\n\nTaylor Swift: I have a lucky number. My lucky number is 13. Whenever I see the number somewhere, I see it as a sign. As a sign that things are moving in the right direction and everything will be okay. For example, at the Grammys in 2010. We won four awards in one night, which was really crazy. I saw 13 over and over again, on street signs, on walls. Every time I looked at the clock, the time had something to do with 13. Even here, when I went to the library, I browsed through the books and picked up a book that had the number 13 on it. That shows that it stays that way, that I am really, really lucky.\n\nGLAMOUR: You are really successful in Europe. How important is Europe and especially Germany to you?\n\nTaylor Swift: Europe and Germany have always been very special to me. I love coming here. And if the album is successful, I'll have an excuse to come here again, visit my fans and play concerts. And I think it's so great that my fans learn my lyrics even though they speak a different language. That means so much to me.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Flashback: What Was The First Rap Song Taylor Swift Memorized?\n\nBy Siobhan O’Connor\n\nGIRL, UNINTERRUPED\nSprouting beyond her country roots and into pop’s concentrated limelight, Taylor Swift is all grown up\n\nTaylor Swift is a kiss-and-tell kind of girl. She kisses. She tells—often in raw, resonant, emotional detail in her songs. Just don’t ask her to reveal who, exactly, she’s singing about: She’d rather leave that up to the tabloids, which she doesn’t read, or your own imagination, which she tries not to think about. Instead, the 22-year-old Nashville transplant likes to keep her focus on the music, which has changed considerably since she first emerged as a new-country darling in 2006. Now, with Red, her fourth album, Swift is taking some risks, she says. And while she keeps her cards close to her chest, she opened up to VIBE about stalking Young Buck’s car collection, evolving into a mega pop sensation and the bad points of good guys.\n\nVIBE: On Red, you wrote 10 songs alone, and co-wrote 6. What’s your favorite?\nTAYLOR SWIFT: Well, there’s two: “I Knew You Were Trouble” and “Treacherous,” and they’re about the same person. “Treacherous” is about falling for someone who is a dangerous choice, a risk, but you go for it anyway. There’s a line that says, “Nothing safe is worth the drive.” For me, that line defines the album.\n\nHow so?\nThe song is about taking a step toward this relationship knowing this can really hurt you. But it’s taking a risk, not a safe one, and the fact that that can be much more worth it than…\n\nThe safe, boring guy?\nYeah.\n\nYou’re taking some risks in your career, too, in terms of the genres you’re embracing.\nI like to let other people discuss genre and what they think falls into what category. For this album, I wasn’t worried about what people were going to say. When I’m in the studio I try to always write from an emotional place. Did that emotion feel like a totally insane chaotic bass drop or like something more acoustic?\n\nAre you a hip-hop fan?\nI love hip-hop! The first one I memorized was “Fireman” by Lil Wayne. Ever since then… It’s Nicki Minaj, Wiz Khalifa, The Game. When I was in high school, my boyfriend and I would drive around and he’d always point to this neighborhood where Young Buck lived. We would drive by and look at his cars and be like ‘Oh my gawwwwwd! Those cars are so coooool! I wonder if he’s in there!”\n\nWill we hear America’s Sweetheart rapping anytime soon?\nI can’t imagine myself rapping. No. That would be more of a comedy thing.\n\nYou’re 22 now, and you’re diversifying. Do you want to shake that sweetie-pie image?\nSome people take fashion risks or give really edgy interviews. I leave the risks to my music. And listen: People have a lot going on in their lives. A million things. Developing a complex opinion about every celebrity isn’t exactly high on people’s to-do list. So people end up seeing me as one thing. If America’s Sweetheart is that thing, then I’m fine with that.\n\nThere are worse things.\nThere are worse things.\n\nWhy did your parents name you Taylor?\nTwo reasons: Because of James Taylor. Also they liked the fact that it was a name for a boy or a girl. And my mom thought, if I went into business and someone got my résumé, they wouldn’t be able to make a decision about me based on my gender\n.\nSo this you-can-make-it-no-matter-what thing was baked into you.\nAbsolutely. Even before I was born.\n\nBut you’ve also said you’re really superstitious.\nYeah, I think if I say something it will jinx it, and then it won’t happen. I’ve been built up and let down enough times in life that I feel like things can change in an instant. I don’t know… I have a lucky number—13—I knock on wood. I think about luck and hope that things don’t go wrong.\n\nWhat kind of letdowns are we talking about?\nIf you’re not careful, things can go away. I’ve seen people with great careers until they started taking them for granted. I am so scared of a misstep, of one thing getting blown out of proportion and ruining everything. Everyone says this is the time in your life you’re supposed to make mistakes and learn lessons. I can’t do that the way everyone else can. If I make one mistake, it’s a news story. It’s a weird way to grow up.\n\nDoes it get harder, the more mega-famous you get, to keep your lyrics authentic?\nOne thing that makes it easy to keep writing personal songs: I know that I’m never going to say who any song is about. That’s the one thing I have. I write songs to convey a message to whoever I wrote it about. People can speculate all they want, but I’ll never tell. I want my fans to listen and think about their ex-boyfriend or their situation.\n\nTell me about “I Knew You Were Trouble.” Any regrets about pursuing that relationship?\nNo. If it makes you feel anything, it’s worth it. I run into people who are really complex characters. They’re not great boyfriend material—but they’re great characters to write about. Those people can inspire me so much more than someone who’s nice and simple and great. That’s a nice thing to have in a human being. But do you want to write songs about that person? No.",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] As pop princesses go, Taylor Swift couldn't be more perfect. So perfect, in fact, you wonder how they ever allowed that rampaging hacky sack of teenage hormones, Harry Styles, anywhere near her.\nBecause, like all exquisitely crafted fairytales, the legend is dependent on nourishing and protecting the verisimilitude of its heroine. In Taylor's case, her best interests are served by a tight-knit group of managers and PRs who lay down rules regarding fashion decency ('no flesh below the waistline, if there's too much shown above' and 'exposed navels are a no-go zone\"); while a pair of XXI, narrow-eyed ex-marines are detailed to ward off any physical threat, both real or imagined. (The photography studio is subject to an impressive 'security sweep' prior to her entrance.)\nSuch is the attention to image-management, it's something of a surprise when Taylor politely requests her own musical accompaniment for the InStyle shoot and a hip-hop heavy playlist is selected. More so when, an hour in, there she is, shaking her tush in Valentino to Jay-Z's '99 Problems', blissfully rapping along to the profanity-laden track with word-perfect proficiency.\nTurns out the 23-year-old, whose most famous lyric is arguably the rather less contentious-'We are never ever ever getting back together' is quite the hip-hop aficionado.\nA few hours later, Taylor is telling me how, growing up, Britney, Hanson and the Dixie Chicks fought for space on her bedroom walls alongside those poster-boys of rap, 50 Cent and Eminem. \"I love hip-hop so much,\" she gushes. \"There's something so honest about it.\" The unlikely suggestion that she might one day appear on an Eminem record is met with unexpected enthusiasm. \"Nobody wants to hear me rap but I'd sing a chorus for someone for sure. I would sign up for that in a heartbeat.\"\nBut surely your team might have something to say on the subject? \"I don't have like a hig scary management situation where I have to ask them,\" she replies. \"If I wrote a song called F. I think people would kind of raise their hand and go, like, maybe swear less in your music. [I tell her she is allowed to use the word 'fuck' but she pointedly declines.] But I just don't really feel like swearing in my music.\" The idea that some cursin', blunt-tokin' playa could possibly get their mitts on sweet Taylor Swift will send a wave of shivers coursing across the plains of Middle America. But maybe that's the point. The singer's phenomenal talent and success is, in part, as much due to the quixotic nature of her character as it is reliant on the fictional or otherwise girl-next-door persona promoted by she and the team behind her, all too aware of the power of the playground dollar. There's a game to be played and she plays it extremely well. Wrapped up in her neat tartan-check coat, to stave off the chill of the British winter, she's both uniquely beautiful and gawky at the same time, still not quite used to her 5ft 10 in model frame.\nShe chats away like teenager during recess. Her blog, recounted so many times before, takes on an almost magical (one of Taylor's favourite words) quality; a charming script worthy of a Broadway musical. How she and her younger brother Austin, three years her junior, were raised on a 10-acre Christmas Tree farm in Pennsylvania by doting parents, Scott and Andrea; he a high-flying stockbroker with financial behemoth Merrill Lynch, she a stay-at-home mum. How she was always the odd one out, the loner in class at her upscale Junior High School in Wyomissing, confiding in her diary and poetry for comfort. Then, having picked up a guitar aged 12, and encouraged by her family, began performing in local talent contests and singing Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks covers and her self-penned tunes in coffee bars, \"playing for tips\", as she puts it. At the same time this was happening, she did a little modelling for Abercrombie & Fitch, won a national poetry contest with an ode entitled \"Monster In\nMy Closet' and started bombarding record companies with demos. Her prodigious musical talent only had the effect of increasing alienation among her envious classmates. They thought her \"weird and different\", she says. So she'd go home and write a song about her tormentors, and kept strumming away in those coffee bars, working audiences of \"up to 200\", \"When you're dealing with something like loneliness or confusion or rejection or frustration, those emotions are so jumbled up in your head,\" she looks back\nnow. \"For me, the only way to condense them down into one thing is to write a three-and-a-half minute song about it. I would sit with the guitar and in my head I would go, \"If you could say one thing to that girl, what would you say?\"\nThe story is so polished that even when relaying childhood traumas which might consign lesser beings to years on the psychiatrist's couch, she manages to gift-wrap her darkest moments with a Polly-Pocket-meets-Tracey-Emin-by-Hasbro countenance. Didn't she have a best friend, back then? \"My mom was my best friend,\" she cheerily comes back. \"I first started writing songs because I didn't really have anyone else to talk to. As sad as that sounds, I was going through this really because it connects you to your fans forever. Unfortunately, when you let your fans into your life through your lyrics, you're also letting everyone else into your life. For me it's never been something that I've ever regretted.\"\nDoes she ever censor herself?\n\"No. I don't see the point,\" she says, adding that boyfriends, past or present, are included in that certainty. But, has anyone written a song about you? \"Yes, and I can take it,\" she insists. \"If I'm gonna write songs about my exes they can write songs about me. That's how it works. I'm not gonna complain about it. I'm not gonna sit there and say, 'I'm the only one who can write songs about this relationship'. It's fair game.\"\nFor those who challenge her integrity, their accusations are mistaken. Teenage girls choose their torchbearers wisely, and aren't that easily fooled. However, while Taylor's happy to commit her romantic travails to music, interviewers are warned off probing deeper.\nWhen I tell her, over the winter months, the British newspapers reduced her output down to two details - Harry Styles and her love of Portobello Road antiques - she chooses to ignore the former and concentrate her exasperation on her bargain hunt purchases.\n\"Where'd that come from? Sure [...I like antiques], but do I like flowers? Yes. I think when you don't talk about your personal life in the press I think they make one up for you.\" I ask her if she's happier in love or out of love.\n\"It's hard to say,\" she comes back, \"Because there are beautiful things about both and I just feel like you have to find those things.\"\nSpeaking to Taylor, what becomes apparent, is that far from being the man-grabbing vixen the headlines have recently portrayed, she endearingly clings to romantic ideals. There's a sweet schoolyard innocence about her and her views on love.\nLike she's stuck, whether that be for the benefit of herself or her fans, as the girl with curly hair resigned to eating lunch alone. She tells me that's she's not really much of a \"keeper-in-toucher\" when it comes to ex-boyfriends and that she doesn't have many male friends.\n\"I'm a girls' girl. I have guy friends but the problem with having guy friends is, like, I always get linked to them and they'll end up in a slideshow of people I've apparently dated\non the internet. I mean, there's all kinds of complicated things with having guys as friends.\" What kinds of complications? \"If they have a girlfriend who doesn't like you or things like that. So I have like two or three guy friends. A select few. But I have like 20-25 really good girlfriends.\"\nHigh on that list are Glee star Dianne Agron, fashion stylist Ashley Avignone and jewellery designer Claire Kislinger. In April of last year, Taylor tweeted pictures of the foursome dressed up to the vintage nines celebrating legendary actress Shirley MacLaine's 79th birthday at Beverly Hills Hotel Polo Lounge.\n\"I finally have really amazing girlfriends,\" she says, \"You know, if something happens I have six girls I'm gonna call just one after the other, or on conference call, or in a group text. We tell each other absolutely everything.\"\nI say, she comes across as quite the 'old soul' and she quite likes that. \"I sometimes wonder where songs come. But I'd like to think that once I've learned a lesson in this life I don't have to learn it twice. Like when it comes to relationships, friendships.\" Are you looking for perfection in your relationships? \"No I don't, because that's unrealistic. I think what's so beautiful about life is the constant... it's the imperfection. What you want in a lasting relationship is someone loving you despite your imperfections.\"\nDo you dwell on things? \"Definitely. I mean, I think, as a writer you play back what happened in the past over and over and over again and that's\nwhat you get inspiration from.\" Just because I'm eager to hear her reaction, I wonder whether she would like to fast-forward and see what her life looks like in 30 years time. \"That would be terrifying,\" she holds her head in her hands. \"Half of me says absolutely, 'yes, what does my life look. like?\" And then there's another part of me that's just...I don't necessarily think it would be cute anymore for me to be putting on sparkly dresses and strutting around a stage.\"\nSettled down?\n\"Maybe. Depends on what happens.\" Would you like a family?\n\"I think so but I'm not sure. Like, I don't even have a master plan. I've thought that I did have a dream scenario before but it turns out that I change my mind and that essentially in your 20s all the puzzle pieces of your life are thrown up in the air and they just fall into whatever place and I think that's healthy, What I worry about is that I never want to end up kind of a self-centred, vain human being. My friend Lena did this interview where she said you have to have this equal amount of self-loathing and self-love.\" Lena? I say.\n\"She's on a show called Girls. She's so intelligent in her interviews and also just in conversation... My fears circle around me making the wrong choices and messing this up for myself. I don't wanna end up being awful and intolerable. Alone. Laying in a marble bathtub by myself, like sad, with a glass of wine just complaining that my life ended up alone because I pushed everyone away because I thought I was too good to hang out with anybody. The typical Hollywood sad cliché of the poor lonely starlet with no one because she put up all these walls and didn't trust anyone. That's my fear. And that's why I live my life the way I live my life because I'd so much rather feel everything than end up like that.\" And might you still be writing that last break-up song?\n\"I could be,\" she smiles. \"It could be happening.\"\nI hope not.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift’s Telltale Heart\nThe very openness that helped make Taylor Swift a record-breaking pop-country idol has turned into a double-edged sword. After baring her heart in hit songs, the 23-year-old musician now finds her love life—or some distorted version of it—treated as a joke. During a girls-night-in at Swift’s Nashville apartment (the one with the indoor koi pond), Nancy Jo Sales hears about the real thing.\n\nBy Nancy Jo Sales Photographs by Peter Lindbergh Styled by Jessica Diehl\n\nAt the Golden Globes this year, after mutually losing out for best actress in a comedy series to Lena Dunham of Girls, hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler mounted the stage with drinks in hand, making light of their disappointment by appearing bitter and drunk. “Everyone’s getting a little loose now that we’re all losers,” Poehler joked. “Congratulations, Lena,” said Fey. “I’m glad we got you through middle school.” The camera cut to Dunham shaking with laughter and clutching her gold statuette. “It’s getting sloppy in here, everybody,” Fey went on. “Look at how drunk Glenn Close is.” Close played along, simulating delirium tremens. And then: “You know what, Taylor Swift,” said Fey, shaking a finger. “You stay away from Michael J. Fox’s son.”\n\nThe joke wouldn’t have worked without the audience being aware of Swift’s highly scrutinized romantic life, the stuff of tabloid obsession. The 23-year-old music mega-star has dated some of the entertainment world’s most visible bachelors (Jake Gyllenhaal, Taylor Lautner, John Mayer, Joe Jonas), only to write chart-topping songs about how they allegedly broke her heart—or she theirs. She made $57 million last year and has become one of the best-selling female recording artists in music history, all while gaining sweet revenge. So the zinger hit home, and the audience exploded with laughter, and, as if it were middle school all over again, some went “Ooooooh.”\n\n“Or go for it, or go for it,” Poehler interjected as the camera cut to a grinning Michael J. Fox (whose handsome 23-year-old son, Sam, was this year’s “Mr. Golden Globe”). “No,” said Fey. “She needs some ‘me’ time to learn about herself.” That got another big laugh. In gossip news that week: Swift had allegedly been left by Harry Styles, the then 18-year-old lead moppet of the British boy band One Direction and her boyfriend of a few months.\n\nSwift, who had also lost that night, for best original song (she was nominated along with John Paul White, Joy Williams, and T Bone Burnett for “Safe and Sound,” from The Hunger Games), to Adele (who won for “Skyfall,” from the James Bond film), was in the ladies’ room at the time. So she didn’t hear the sound of everybody who was anybody in Hollywood laughing at her for allegedly having her heart broken all over again. It was the kind of thing that happens in a Taylor Swift song: nice girl gets made fun of by mean girl while powdering her nose, then goes home and writes a song about it—which becomes a No. 1 hit.\n\nWhen asked by Access Hollywood a week later if she was afraid that Swift would write a song about her, Fey said, “I hope so. I would love it!” And maybe she will. When we were discussing that moment at the Golden Globes, and mean girls in general, Swift just smiled and said, “You know, Katie Couric is one of my favorite people because she said to me she had heard a quote that she loved”—from former secretary of state Madeleine Albright—“that said, ‘There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help other women.’ ”\n\nOn a cold February day in Nashville, Swift was at SIR Studios rehearsing for the current 47-city tour to support her album Red (2012). Down a long hallway decorated with hanging guitars and a neon picture of Dolly Parton was the large garage-like space where Swift was practicing the song “I Knew You Were Trouble”—No. 2 that week on the Billboard Hot 100—with her six-piece band. Swift writes perfect pop songs that stick in your head like lollipops stuck in your hair. After I listened to her perform the song once, it stayed in my brain for days as if it had been implanted there by diabolical Russian scientists. It was a song about a guy—a rotten guy who had loved her and left her cold. “Trouble! Trouble!” Swift spat. All over the Internet, bloggers and fans were reading the tea leaves Swift puts in her liner notes providing clues about the identity of the guy who had left her “lying on the cold hard ground” this time.\n\nSwift is sometimes criticized for the thinness of her voice, but it sounded sweet and melodic, with a bit of country twang. She was strumming on a Taylor guitar (she favors the brand) inlaid with mother-of-pearl. When the song was done she came running over and embraced me as if I were her long-lost aunt. (She’s known to be a hugger.) “Hi, I’m Taylor!” she exclaimed. She’s a tall (five feet ten inches), slight girl with curving blue-jean-blue eyes and full Kewpie-doll lips. Her hair, which she sometimes dyes platinum and wears crimped, was a honey gold and hanging straight. She was wearing salmon corduroys, a pale-pink button-down, black socks, and frumpy lace-up shoes.\n\nSwift cultivates a gawky adorkability in her music videos, in which she often plays the unloved girl alone in her room pining over the cute guy. The bio Swift’s publicist had sent me was adorkable too: “Hi, I’m Taylor. I love the number 13. I was born in December on a Christmas tree farm”—actually a hospital, in Reading, Pennsylvania, in 1989. Swift spent her early childhood on a Christmas-tree farm in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, in a picturesque house owned by her parents, Andrea, who had worked in finance, and Scott, then a stockbroker with Merrill Lynch. “My favorite thing in life is writing about life, specifically the parts of life concerning love,” her bio went on. “Because, as far as I’m concerned, love is absolutely everything.”\n\nWatching her rehearse that day, it became clear that Swift works incredibly hard. While her band—which she commands in a friendly, laid-back way—was taking a break, she continued practicing, playing songs on her guitar and piano, and going over sound issues with her soundman. “I’m the type of person, I have to study to get an A on the test,” she would tell me later. “I have to work really hard to get the record deal—I have to spend years at it to get good. I have to practice to be good at guitar. I have to write 100 songs before you write the first good one.”\n\nHer determination has paid off. The Taylor Swift triumphant music stats can go on and on, but here are a few: She’s a seven-time Grammy winner and the youngest person ever to win Album of the Year (for Fearless,™ in 2009). She’s the only female artist, and the fourth artist ever, to twice have an album (Red and 2010’s Speak Now) sell a million copies in its first week. With Red, she became the first artist since the Beatles—and the only female artist ever—to have three consecutive albums spend six or more weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. She has sold more than 26 million albums and 75 million song downloads worldwide. She holds the Billboard record for the most Top 10 debuts in the history of its Hot 100.\n\nAt a time when the music industry is notoriously in disarray, Swift is selling albums like it’s 1979. “She’s one of the few genuine rock stars we’ve got these days, with a flawless ear for what makes a song click,” said Rolling Stone. Neil Young has called her “a great writer.” Kris Kristofferson said, “She blows me away.” Stevie Nicks—defending Swift after their disastrous live duo at the 2010 Grammys, in which Swift sounded pitchy—compared her songwriting to Elton John’s and Neil Diamond’s.\n\nAnd then there are the inevitable endorsements. Swift is a brand. She’s been called “America’s Sweetheart”: she rarely drinks, doesn’t smoke, go clubbing, or get arrested—she’s the anti-Lohan, and this squeaky-clean image has made her an attractive advertising partner for Target, Sony, CoverGirl, Keds, Elizabeth Arden, and, recently, Diet Coke.\n\nBut something happened to Swift’s long media honeymoon sometime over the last year. Suddenly people—and not just haters on the Internet but public figures—were making fun of her. It started with Ellen DeGeneres’s good-natured ribbing every time Swift appeared on her show and then progressed to the 2012 Country Music Awards (Swift has won 15 C.M.A.’s, by the way), at which hosts Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley mocked Swift’s summer romance with Kennedy-family scion Conor Kennedy, 18. “Are they ever gonna get back together?” Paisley asked. “Never, ever, ever,” Underwood replied, referencing another one of Swift’s No. 1 hits off Red, the maddeningly catchy “We Are Never Getting Back Together.” “Like, never.”\n\nThe week I went to Nashville, there was a story in The Star headlined taylor swift: laughingstock. It ran with a picture of Swift weeping, which she told me was actually taken at an event where she was singing for children with cancer.\n\nAfter the rehearsal was over, Swift drove me to her apartment in her Lexus S.U.V. She admitted she was nervous, as the last time she had a reporter in the car (Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone), she had two minor accidents. On the same day. She also told me she didn’t trust reporters, ever since she caught one (a female) rifling through her purse. But we arrived at her apartment building without incident. It was a high-rise in midtown Nashville, which Swift said she had dreamed of living in when she saw it being built several years ago. “I told my mother, I’m going to live there someday,” she said. “It just looked so grown-up.”\n\nHer bodyguard, a stalwart Tennessean, rode up with us in the elevator; he’d been following us in his car. Swift has a 24-hour security detail. “It’s because of the guys who write and say they want to chain me up in their basements,” she said. “One was in California and drove all the way to Nashville and tried to get into this building.”\n\nThe moment you walk into Swift’s giant penthouse, you know she isn’t faking it with all those love songs about high-school heartbreak and dreaming of the perfect guy. She really is that romantic. She may just be the girliest girl in America. Her foyer is covered with frames of brightly colored paper flowers; inside, you’re greeted by a six-foot topiary rabbit. There are antique birdcages everywhere and mobs of crocheted throw pillows. There’s a koi pond in the middle of the living room, whose 20-foot windows look to the Great Smoky Mountains beyond Nashville.\n\n“Meredith is scared of the fish,” Swift said. Meredith was the little Scottish Fold (named after Meredith Grey on Grey’s Anatomy) strolling around, mewing, looking like the Cheshire cat. I asked Swift what she would call her style. She said, “Tim Burton-Alice in Wonderland-pirate ship-Peter Pan.” She collects old bottles, antique books, and precious little knickknacks. In her bedroom, in which everything was white and fluffy, she had a copy of Broken Open: How Difficult Times Can Help Us Grow (2005), by Elizabeth Lesser.\n\n“I have no social life,” she told me as she gave the tour. But it seems she does have a lot of friends. Along the stairwell leading up to her apartment’s second level, where she keeps her gleaming 1913 Steinway piano, were framed photographs of Swift with her inner circle: actresses Emma Stone and Selena Gomez; Caitlin Evanson, the fiddle player in her band; Hayley Williams, of the indie band Paramore. “I need to have pictures of people I love everywhere,” Swift said.\n\nThere were pictures of her posing with her heroes James Taylor (whom she was named after; her mother was a fan) and Kris Kristofferson. “That’s my boss,” she said of a picture of Scott Borchetta, the president and C.E.O. of the Nashville-based Big Machine Label Group, who signed her to his newly formed label in 2005 and is widely credited with mapping out her strategy for global domination. Swift was just 14 when she persuaded her mother and father to move the family to Nashville from Wyomissing, Pennsylvania (an affluent suburb of Reading), where they had lived since she was 9, so she could pursue a career in country music like her hero Faith Hill. (Her father transferred to the Nashville office of Merrill Lynch.)\n\nShe also had a framed photograph of that moment at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards when Kanye West interrupted her acceptance speech for best female video (for “You Belong with Me”) to cry, “Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!” Lots of things seem to happen to Swift at awards shows. She wrote a song about that, called “Innocent” (2010). “You’re still an innocent,” she reassured West in the lyrics.\n\nThe incident wound up looking bad for him, good for her. “He’s a jackass,” President Obama said of West in a candid moment. But now Swift is the one who’s on the receiving end of some negative press, and it seems to be really bugging her.\n\nWe had dinner—chicken sandwiches and lavender lemonade ordered in from one of her favorite spots—at her dining table, which sits cozily alongside her open kitchen. She kept using the word “situation”—she spoke of a “drama situation” and a “guy situation”—and I asked her if “situation” was now a “thing.” “Could I be paving the way for ‘situation’?” she joked. “I think so,” I said. “This situation is amazing,” she said. She was funny.\n\nAnd then our conversation turned to the Golden Globes. “I was just sort of like, Oh well, you know, I can laugh at myself,” Swift said. “But what it ended up adding to was this whole kind of everyone jumping on the bandwagon of ‘Taylor dates too much’—which, you know, if you want some big revelation, since 2010 I have dated exactly two people.” Conor Kennedy and Harry Styles. “And the fact that there are slide shows,” she said, “of a dozen guys that I either hugged on a red carpet or met for lunch or wrote a song with but I apparently was, quote unquote, ‘linked’ to them—it’s just kind of ridiculous.”\n\nIt probably doesn’t help this situation that Swift writes songs about the guys she dates and then sends her fans on scavenger hunts to find out who they are. While some women are content to just leave an angry voice-mail message or throw the guy’s clothes in the street, Swift lets the whole world know he’s been a heel. After dating former Disney star Joe Jonas in 2008, she publicly announced he’d broken up with her in a 27-second phone call. (He said she hung up on him.) She then allegedly wrote several songs about their breakup, including “Better than Revenge,” released in 2010 (in which she says of the young woman who stole him away, “She’s an actress, whoa / She’s better known for the things that she does on the mattress, whoa”). And then there was Twilight hunk Taylor Lautner, whom Swift also dated in 2009 after meeting him on the set of Valentine’s Day (2010), in which she had a small role as a boy-crazy girl, and about whom she allegedly wrote the apologetic breakup song “Back to December,” released in 2010 (“You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was good-bye”).\n\nThen there was bluesy rock musician and former Jennifer Aniston beau John Mayer, whom Swift dated in 2009 and 2010 and about whom she allegedly wrote the scathing “Dear John” (“Dear John, I see it all now that you’re gone / Don’t you think I was too young to be messed with?”). Mayer told Rolling Stone, “It was a really lousy thing for her to do.” And then there was real actor Jake Gyllenhaal, whom she dated in 2010 and about whom she allegedly wrote the song “All Too Well” (“But I’m not fine at all”).\n\n“I’m sick of the tabloids’ saying I obsess over guys,” Swift told me. “Why would you obsess over guys? They don’t like it.”\n\nIt’s ironic that Swift, who has often spoken of having lived through a miserable middle-school experience in Wyomissing, where she was ostracized for being different—an “awkward,” temporarily overweight girl who sang the national anthem at professional sports events—now finds herself at the center of a celebrity culture infused with all the meanness of junior high. The source of her appeal has always been her ability to dig deep into her youthful feelings and reveal them in all their painfulness. One of her most moving songs, “Fifteen” (2009), is a ballad about the vulnerability of a girl at the edge of maturation.\n\nBut something else has driven her to the top of the charts, and that, of course, is her willingness to play peekaboo with the tabloids, to discreetly gossip about her exes—and herself. In an era in which the gossip business has exploded like a mushroom cloud, it’s actually a rather brilliant marketing move. That doesn’t mean it was conscious—Swift is, after all, a product of this era too; she calls herself an “Internet baby.” But she has sometimes seemed to get a little jolt out of knowing that the people who have been mean to her are getting their just deserts.\n\nWe were both laughing at the absurdity of it.\n\n“That’s so funny,” I said, “ ’cause that does make you sound like a psycho.”\n\n“Oh my God, you think I don’t know that?” Swift said. “O.K., one of these things I say to myself to calm myself down when I feel like it’s all too much … If there’s a pregnancy rumor, people will find out it’s not true when you wind up not being pregnant, like nine months from now, and if there’s a house rumor, they’ll find out it’s not true when you are actively not ever spotted at that house.”\n\nIt seems Swift actually did buy the house—just not because she was dating Conor Kennedy. According to someone close to the situation, Swift and her parents had been viewing the property for over a year, on the recommendation of Rory Kennedy. When Swift was growing up, her family summered in Stone Harbor on the Jersey Shore. “Taylor likes that East Coast beach thing,” said the source. So the Swifts were in the market for a beachfront property.\n\nIn November of 2012, the Cape Cod Times reported that the seven-bedroom, 4,440-square-foot 1928 Colonial at 27 Marchant Avenue in Hyannis Port had been bought for $4.8 million by a shell company identified as Ocean Drive LLC. The filing papers for the company name as its manager Jesse P. Schaudies, a lawyer in Nashville. Schaudies works for 13management—that’s Taylor Swift’s management company. (Remember? Swift “loves the number 13.”)\n\nSchaudies did not return calls to 13management’s offices. But according to the source, the Hyannis Port house was recently sold: “It was like a house-flip. A good short-term investment.”\n\n‘The last year of my life was so much fun,” Swift said that night at her apartment. “Being 22—oh my God, I was single and happy and carefree and confused and didn’t care,” which are almost the lyrics to another one of her songs, “22,” from Red. “And I’m still kind of that way,” she said. “Like, yeah, I’m dealing with a little bit of a chaotic media circus right now, but that’ll die down in a few weeks when people realize there’s nothing left to talk about.\n\n“But there’s also a lesson in all this,” Swift said. She is big on lessons. “Songwriting’s, like, the final stage of me finally learning a lesson.\n\n“I think there is a lesson in knowing that you can live your life in a way that you’re proud of and people are still gonna take shots,” she said. “And that’s not just in the world that I live in—that’s in middle school, and that’s in high school, and that’s in college, and that’s when you get your first job.” “Why you gotta be so mean?” say the lyrics to her song “Mean” (2010).\n\nWhen she walks out onto the stage, Swift always takes a moment to close her eyes and just feel the love of her cheering fans. She’s a girl who loves love and wants to be in love—but she says she’s willing to wait until she gets it right. “Part of me just feels like it’s gonna be wrong until it’s right,” she said, talking in song lyrics again; this one hadn’t been written yet. “I’m perfectly happy for all my past relationships to be wrong until I find the one that’s right, because I’m very happy not having found my great love yet.\n\n“I’m not actively looking, because you don’t find anything when you’re looking for it, but I think what I would mostly be looking for in a guy … is someone who sees me in my actual dimensions: 23 years old, five-foot-ten, people close to her call her ‘Tay,’ was really insecure in middle school. Like, a guy who wants to know the stories of who I was before this, and the things that aren’t on my Wikipedia page and the things that didn’t happen on an awards show—a guy who just wants to know the girl.\n\n“If I could find someone who just looked at me like I’m a girl,” she said, “like a girl they want to be their girlfriend, with all my accomplishments and my criticisms, without this big cartoon character that most people see me as because they don’t know me … I just want a guy to be dating me as a girl.” She made a slurping sound with her straw. Her lemonade was finished.\n\n“You know what I always do?” she said. “I have my sanity button that I push. I push this button that’s like ‘Stop complaining, your life’s great, stop, do not complain about this life, stop, this life is amaaaazing.’ Sanity button.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Cool Indie Tracks By CAROLINE MCGUIRE\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT has gone from being a relative unknown this time last year to arguably one of the biggest stars at the Brit Awards.\nEven though she's been an A-lister for years in her native US, the singer's profile has only recently gone strato spheric this side of the pond.\nThis is thanks to her first UK Nol album, Red, the smash singles We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together and I Knew You Were Trouble, not to mention a high-profile relationship with ONE DIRECTION'S HARRY STYLES.\nThe new success hasn't passed Taylor by either.\nShe said: \"With the music having done so well, it just feels like a different kind of trip this time that's really great.\n\"Love Story was a hit in 2008 but that's kind of the last time that I was on the radio here, and so it just shows how amazing the fans have been to have stayed with me.\n\"It is wonderful to have a hit on the radio here again.\n\"It feels great. I love listening to Radio 1 and Capital and having my song come on a few times in a 20-minute drive. It makes me feel really good.\"\n\nTaylor spends a lot of time con- necting with her fanbase through social media she has 24 million Twitter followers and 39 million fans on Facebook. But the singer knows that won't guarantee her the gong at tomorrow's Brits because the Interna- tional Female Solo Artist category is voted for by music industry insiders. She said: \"I knew that I'd made an album that my fans would like because I feel like I completely know them and they know me and there's this bond. \"But with music critics that I respect, I know every one of them has a different idea of what they want from me now.\n\"So that's what I get nervous about that people will like this album in general and see it positively, that I've decided to evolve and work with different people and work outside of my comfort zone. Taylor won't have much time for letting her hair down at the awards.\nApart from her own category focusing on her performance and of one the awards Taylor will keep an especially close eye on is British Single Of The Year, because of her weakness for a catchy pop tune. She said: \"I love a really great pop melody that will get stuck in your head. I've come to appreciate hookyness as a specific art form.\n\n\"I don't think that just because a song is a huge hit on the radio that you shouldn't download it and share it on a playlist with your friends.\n\"You shouldn't just have to have some indie song that makes you seem cool for having it on your playlist. I appreciate catchiness as well.\"\nBut although Taylor's looking forward to the ceremony, she's still nervous about the mine- field of having to meet so many people. Despite several years on the awards ceremony circuit, the country star added she's still terrible at awkward celebrity encounters. She said: \"I end up\ntrying to high-five peo all the and they just don't see it. \"Or when you go in for a hug and they try to kiss you on the cheek and you don't understand that they're doing that so you end up kissing them on the neck accidentally.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Moving Along Swiftly\nTaylor Swift talks about how emotions feed her songs, how she manages life in the public eye, and ultimately, how she doesn't give two hoots what you think of her\n\nYou may wear your heart six-time Grammy Award- winning Taylor Swift, she chooses to let it all out in her music. Her fourth studio album Red is no exception, which she says is all about love. The album's lead single, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", topped the iTunes charts the world over and sold a whopping 623,000 copies in the first week making it her first-ever chart topper. Critics say that this album is her best yet because it showcases Swift's flexibility as a musician and her successful experimentation with different genres. Fans love it because like all her other albums, the lyrics speak out to them, given that they can relate with everything that Swift is crooning about. It's no wonder then. why Red sold over one million copies in its debut week in the US, making it the second highest debut for a female. artist at number one behind Britney Spears's \"Oops!... I Did It Again\". Very impressive! Swift is definitely going beyond the success she already has to prove to the world that she deserves every bit of being the star she is. Here, she talks about the new album as well as what inspires on your sleeve but for the those hits.\n\nYour new album Red is fantastic. What is your writing process, do you sit there with a guitar and let it flow?\nThat's definitely what happens. I wrote a song with Ed Sheeran for this record and we have very similar writing styles. You just start ad-libbing and playing chords and singing over it. I'll get an idea in the middle of the day or in the middle of the night it really doesn't matter what time of day it is, it's just something that sort of pops up.\n\nSo do you have a notepad by the bed?\nI have a notepad. I have my phone that has a recording App because sometimes you'll get a melody that has a beat in your head and it sounds so dumb in the morning when you wake up and you're listening to this voice memo and singing on top of it. But somehow you get an idea from it.\n\nSo is the middle of the night when you get your best Ideas?\nThe middle of the night is when a lot of good ideas come. Or sometimes you'll be driving down the road and something will just pop into your head. It's a lot of the time when I'm travelling on a plane or when I'm in the car, you start thinking about things. And I kind of think of things in lyrics.\nThe album is called Red and It's about love. \n\nAnd for you red is the colour of love? \nYeah. It's the colour of love, the colour of anger, jealously, passion, adventure, and danger all those things.\n\nThat come with love?\nYeah. All the good and the bad. So I think for me this album was really a sort of adventurous departure from what I usually do.\n\nDo you think that writing about love is the one way to get pure passion and emotions just flowing? \nI think yeah. I think for me it's a way of justifying things. Even if something hurt me, it was worth it if I could write a song about it, you know?\n\nAnd that's the way to get a message across to someone by putting it in a song and saying, \"this is exactly what you did?\"\nYeah, it's interesting. It's kind of like writing in your diary and that's why I feel I have a really close relationship with my fans. They know what I've been through for the last couple of years because they've heard it all in the songs.\n\nYou live your life in the public eye, everything is magnified, especially your relationships so how do you deal with that?\nI just kind of pretend it's not happening because there's a lot of stuff written about me that isn't true and things that are speculated-I just don't really pay attention to it. I don't read my own gossip: I don't Google myself. It's a lot more of a healthy way to live when you have a priority on being happy rather than a priority on knowing everything about yourself, like, what people think.\n\nYou would send yourself crazy if you did that.\nYeah, and that's one of those cases where ignorance is definitely bliss. The less you know the better.\n\nDo you live your own life how you want to live it, or are there certain things that you can't do?\nThere are things that I can't do. But I don't really pay much attention to them. I really like to go out, go to restaurants, go to the grocery store, go shopping and go walking around so I love doing that stuff. The things where I'm recommended that I not go are really crowded places. You can't go to fairs and festivals and places where there are like thousands of people walking around because it will create a crowd situation. But it's not that bad.\n\nYou're very accomplished for someone so young. How do you feel about that?\nWinning awards is a big deal. Those are the stories you're going to tell your grandkids some day. It's so exciting to have these memories happening so early in my life and I get stoked about things. I just am never going to be bored by this. I'm never going to take it for granted.",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] 15 minutes with Taylor Swift \nShe's put the glamour back into the country music scene, sold more than 26 millions albums worldwide - and she's only 23! We get the lowdown from Taylor Swift on how she stays healthy despite her hectic schedule, and discover the secret to to getting her signature red lip.\n\nYou really know how to pull off a grown-up glamour' look what are your day-to-day beauty must-haves?\nI always carry an eyelash curler, a good eye the black mascara and red lipstick with me. And a quality moisturiser, too. Even when the sons change, my staples stay the same.\n\nTalking of red lipstick, how do you get it to last through red carpet events?\nOne of the best tricks I've learnt is to blot the first slick of lipstick with a tissue - then with the tissue still on my lips, press on loose powder, peel off the tissue and reapply my lipstick. It turns into a stain that lasts much longer.\n\nDo you have a perfume staple, too?\nRight now, I'm wearing my new perfume, Wonderstruck Enchanted. I wanted the scent to embody that feeling you have when you're just getting to know someone and you really fancy them. I used flowers such as white freesia and peony, with woody undertones to help evoke that feeling.\n\nDo you have any other nostalgic perfume memories?\nWhen I was younger, I loved an American brand called Bath And Body Works- Iwas obsessed with ther warm, vanila-sugar scented products because they smelled like fresh baking, which I find really comforting.\n\nYou spend a lot of time on tour - how do you take care of yourself?\nI always have a bottle of water to hand. My bandmates make fun of me because I drink so much, but staying hydrated is really important, as it helps keep my body healthy and energised.\n\nDo you manage to fit in much exercise?\nI don't have any specific workout routine, really. I love running, but I also like long walks because I can just daydream and listen to music on my beadphones. Recently, I bought a trampoline, which is so much fun. My friends and I have been jumping on it like little kids. I get a workout without even meaning to!\n\nSo if you're not a fitness junkie, do you have to watch what you eat?\nI try to eat healthily most of the time -grilled chicken, brown rice, green beans. But sometimes, I just need something sweet-or maybe a cheeseburger or fried rice. Everything in moderation!",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: Billboard Music Award Wins Were a 'Wonderful Feeling'\nCountry superstar talks about winning eight trophies and her personal highlights of BBMA night.\nThe biggest stars in music lit up the stage of Las Vegas' MGM Grand Garden Arena for the Billboard Music Awards. But no one beamed brighter than Taylor Swift, who netted eight awards. Accepting her gold statue for top artist, Swift gave props to the 3.7 million fans who purchased \"Red\" and drove her across-the-board victories: \"Thank you for making my music the soundtrack to your crazy emotions,\" she said. \"You are the longest and best relationship I've had.\"\nShe also premiered her new single, \"22,\" in one of the night's most spirited performances, which kicked off in her dressing room and wound its way through the audience before hitting the stage. Ditching her glittering blue Zuhair Murad mini-dress for a unicorn-emblazoned T-shirt and shorts, Swift sang of the joys of being her tender age, surrounded by a full posse (including members of two mainstay Vegas acts, Cirque du Soleil and Jabbawockeez). Billboard checked in with Swift just days after the show, as she was already back in the thick of her current U.S. tour.\n\nBillboard: You were the night's big winner. What was the highlight of the night for you personally?\n\nSwift: For me the highlight of the night was standing onstage with my 15 breathless, beaming dancers after we finished our performance. We were all standing together and got to look out into a crowd that was giving us a standing ovation. It was a wonderful feeling.\n\nWhat performances stood out to you? Was there anyone who surprised or moved you in a way you didn't expect?\n\nI loved Ed Sheeran's performance because I get to see him move crowds with just an acoustic guitar and his voice every night on tour, and to watch him do that on a nationally televised scale made me so happy.\n\nWho were you excited to see and meet at the show?\n\nI was just excited that a bunch of my friends were there like Selena [Gomez and Ed]. It turned the night into more of a dance party than a high-pressure media event.\n\nMadonna was the top touring artist. As someone who spends a lot of time on the road, have you learned anything by what she's done in her career?\n\nOne element of Madonna's career that really takes center stage is how many times she's reinvented herself. It's easier to stay in one look, one comfort zone, one musical style. It's inspiring to see someone whose only predictable quality is being unpredictable.\n\nThere were also artists on hand who are part of the new wave of younger performers taking hold at radio -- Selena Gomez performed, and Ariana Grande presented. What advice would you give them?\n\nI never give advice unless someone asks me for it. One thing I've learned, and possibly the only advice I have to give, is to not be that person giving out unsolicited advice based on your own personal experience. I've always had a lot of older people giving me advice because I'm young, and in the end, it all comes down to who you want to be remembered as. Just be that.\n\nHow did you celebrate your victorious night?\n\nWe had a giant dinner at Nobu for all of my bandmates, dancers and friends. It seemed like everyone was there. Ed, Selena, Austin Mahone . . . We were all just laughing together and rejoicing in a really fun evening.\n\nHow late were you out? Where did you go and who did you hang with?\n\nI flew back to L.A. that night, so I was only out till about 1 a.m. Then I got home, said \"hi\" to my cat, then fell asleep in seconds.\n\nYou gave a heartfelt thank-you to your fans and acknowledged them as being \"the longest and best relationship I've had.\" How would you describe that relationship? And how did it feel to have the opportunity to thank them publicly as you accepted artist of the year?\n\nI loved being able to thank my fans for this life they've given me. Being on tour, I get a nightly reminder of how lucky I am to get to stand on giant stages and sing for sold-out crowds. Now I have so many girls my age coming up to me and saying, \"I've listened to you for seven years.\" It's crazy to me that we've been in each other's lives that long and it still feels new. But hey, I guess that's what real love feels like.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Chats Australian Tour, Ed Sheeran and Relationships\nEarlier in the week we caught up on the phone with ARIA Chart topper and world-wide superstar Taylor Swift! We covered everything from her stadium shows set for Australia later this year, working with Ed Sheeran...and whether you should put jam in the fridge or not, all the important stuff!\nInterviewer: We can’t wait for your stadium spectacular – what can we expect? Dancing monkeys, lights, fireworks…\nTaylor Swift: I’m incredibly excited for the stadium shows, ‘it’s blowing my mind’.\nInterviewer: “Everything Has Changed” featuring Ed Sheeran is a beautiful song. Can you give us the emotional push – the heart and soul of the song…\nTaylor Swift: The inspiration was the pre-chorus of “I just want to know you better” and that’s the crux of the song is about “two people seeing each other for the first time, the way they think about life is different, their priorities are different, their outlook just changes.” Doing it as a duet with Ed seemed very appropriate.\nInterviewer: What’s one thing about Ed Sheeran that would definitely surprise us?\nTaylor Swift: Ed is like hanging with both an 8-year-old boy [Ed loves Lego and Lord of the Rings] and an 80-year-wise man as he dishes out the most sage advice.\nInterviewer: Where’s the strangest place you’ve heard one of your songs being played?\nTaylor Swift: She often hears her song on in the car or out at a mall or stall. “My friends are, like, are you going to say anything? Are you going to acknowledge that this is happening? And I’m, like, ‘no’.\nInterviewer: You’re the Queen of Heartbreak. Are you the person in your friendship group that people go to for love advice?\nTaylor Swift: “It’s kind of strange because I’ll make friends with people and they’ll be going through a break-up and we’ll just talk about that. I think so much about relationships and emotions and what goes into all of it – like, talking to my friends about it I’ll just want to help them with whatever they’re going through. And talking about love as a girl is something we just do as a hobby. So that’s definitely a huge topic of conversation. I did not know I was labelled that [The Queen of Heartbreak] by the way, that’s amazing.”\nInterviewer: Can men and women be friends or does someone always want more?\nTaylor Swift: I didn’t think that they could til recently I’ve gotten a few guy friends that, honestly, it’s just that. So, I used to think it was always, like, someone wants more and someone doesn’t. Now I legitimately think you can be really good friends with someone and it just isn’t a relationship thing you know.\nInterviewer: Have you been mistaken for another celebrity?\nTaylor Swift: No. Actually, that would be interesting…\nInterviewer: Best way you’ve celebrated a chart success?\nTaylor Swift: Honestly I just like to get my friends together and either have dinner or have a dance party. I think that, for me, last night was the perfect example because at the Billboard Awards we all had such an amazing time. The performance was something we were really proud of and a lot of my friends were there. We all went out for dinner afterward – it was me and Selena and Ed and a bunch of people we tour with and dancers. It ended up being a great thing, people would text and come out and hang out with us and I love it when you have a bunch of people in one place and everybody just ends up converging in just one place.\nInterviewer: Raspberry Jam – does it belong in the fridge or the cupboard [and why?]\nTaylor Swift: Raspberry jam? Probably fridge because I don’t like the old tops with wax. So, fridge.\nInterviewer: Coming to Australia, what’s the one thing you’re going to do down here other than entertain us?\nTaylor Swift: Beach. Shopping. Restaurants. You guys have amazing food. Kangaroos. I love kangaroos.\nInterviewer: The Queen of Heartbreak … so you’re happy with this title?\nTaylor Swift: I’ll be the queen of anything.\nInterviewer: Next single?\nTaylor Swift: No idea. It’s up to the fans.",

When the anxiety starts, the writing happens right after, usually.\"\n\nSwift has learned from past experiences that the writing process for one of her albums takes about two years.\n\n\"Whatever I write in the first year is going to get thrown away,\" she says. \"I'm going to like it, but it's going to sound like the last record. The second year usually sounds like the next project.\"\n\nMaking each album sound different from the previous one is important, she says. \"I think you need to change up your influences. I think you need to be inspired by different things than you were inspired by before.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Rolling Stone Interview: Backstage With Taylor Swift on Her Huge Summer Stadium Tour\n\"Were you as sweaty as I was tonight?\" Taylor Swift asks as she takes a seat on one of the many padded blue tables in the NFL training room at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium. That would be a no: She just wrapped a seriously athletic two-hour show in which she breakdanced, led a psychedelic drum circle and jumped down from the stage to high-five hundreds of fans.\n\"It's kind of exhilarating, walking through a crazy, insane mob,\" she says. \"The most miraculous process is watching a song go from a tiny idea in the middle of the night to something that 55,000 people are singing back to you.\"\nSwift's Red tour documents her wild ride from twangy teen singer-songwriter to dubstep-dabbling pop megastar. The massive production – which includes a 190-foot stage with a catwalk and a staircase onstage, nine huge video screens and a dozen backup dancers – feels surprisingly intimate, partly because of Swift's habit of going on long confessional tangents.\n\"I am getting to the point where the only love worth being in is the love worth singing about,\" she says. \"Sitting on a bedroom floor crying is something that makes you feel really alone. If someone's singing about that feeling, you feel bonded to that person. That's the only way I can find an explanation for why 55,000 people would want to come see me sing.\"\nWhile Swift designed the 2011 Speak Now tour in the vein of A Midsummer Night's Dream, she took a new approach this year. \"I picture this taking place in New York City,\" she says of the stage show. \"And so you got you've got high intensity excitement and you've got the darkness of all of it and you've got all the fleeting moments of reality, and it's a little bit less of a fairy tale.\"\nThe show also includes openers that have included Ed Sheeran (who opens all shows of the tour), Austin Mahone and Joel Crouse. \"I want people's head spinning at everything they saw and heard,\" says Swift.\n\"She really has every single thing you could expect from a big show,\" says Sheeran, who adds he's had to adapt his set for Swift's audience. \"I've stopped swearing so much when I perform, because there are a lot of young kids in the crowd.\"\nSheeran has also faced the challenge of filling a stadium with only an acoustic guitar. \"I've been trying to work out my own way of doing it,\" he says. \"My show is a lot more off-the-cuff [than Swift's]. I'll decide to play a song, like, two minutes before, so it's less regimented.\"\nBefore tonight's show, Swift attended four fan meet-and-greets and ran through a quick soundcheck with special guest Patrick Stump, who rose onstage in an elevator to surprise fans with Fall Out Boy's \"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up).\" \"It's my jam!\" says Swift.\nAdds Stump, \"She started talking to me about the hydraulics [of the elevator], and I'm like, 'It's crazy how good at this you are. You know all your shit.'\"\nSince her stadium gigs happen mostly on weekends, Swift has spent plenty of downtime lately at her new beachside mansion in Rhode Island. \"There have been a lot of kitchen dance parties with my girlfriends,\" she says. She's been listening to tons of Carly Simon (who just joined her onstage in Massachusetts) and devouring novels, from F. Scott Fitzgerald's Tender Is the Night to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl and Jess Walter's Beautiful Ruins. \"They're great stories, and they kind of take you away,\" she says. And she's already putting together a wish list of collaborators for her fifth album: \"I'm jumping in headfirst.\"\nAfter the show, her workday still isn't quite done. She has one more meet-and-greet scheduled in Club Red, a shrine decked out in photos of Swift and old stage costumes. This one is reserved for fans dressed in the most outrageous costumes: Several girls wear tutus, and there's one dude covered head to toe in red plastic Solo cups. The chatty room falls silent when Swift arrives at midnight. One young fan from Long Island starts crying in the corner. Soon, Swift hugs two girls from the Netherlands, who hand her some waffle-and-syrup cookies from back home. \"Oh, my God, I love these,\" Swift says with a gasp. \"Are these for me to keep?\" They nod.\nLater, as the Dutch girls wait for a train back into New York, they're still buzzing. \"I'm so happy,\" one of them says, staring at a photo of herself with Swift that she's already uploaded to Instagram. \"That was the greatest moment of my life.\"\nHere is the full Q&A from our interview with Swift:\nOnstage, you discussed writing a lot of songs in your bedroom at 2 a.m. What's it like to go from that to playing it for a huge stadium?\nI think the most miraculous process is watching a song go from a tiny idea that you have in the middle of the night to a song that a group of 55,000 people is singing back to you so loudly that you can hear it louder than your own voice coming out of the speakers, in a concert in a stadium. And I think that for me, that's the final part of the process. You know, I'm still so in love with songwriting because it's never the same. You never get the same fragment of information as an idea. It's never just a chorus or a first line – it's always something different. And to piece it together in the crossword puzzle that ends up being your song and have it end up here is so rewarding, you know.\nYou also talked about the \"fiery, difficult, complicated emotions\" that drive those songs. You seem very comfortable talking about those emotions at length onstage. \nI am getting to a point where the only love worth being in is the love worth singing about. And kind of mad love. I think that for me, when you experience something that's worth writing a song about, chances are it's the same kind of intense feeling that someone else has felt, and it has led them to be sitting on a bedroom floor crying, or walking through a crowded room feeling alone or feeling misunderstood by the person who's supposed to know them better than anybody else. Those are things that make you feel really alone, and if someone's singing a song about that feeling, then you feel bonded to that person, and I guess that's the only way I can find an explanation why 55,000 people would want to come see me sing.\nThe show gets pretty dark. During \"Red,\" there's a moment where what looks like blood is spilling across the video screens. Is that somebody's blood? \nActually, no. I've never been into shock value and gory and scaring people. It's actually paint, so it's actually just supposed to be the general concept of something red and something flowing – just red things. Like, there's red fabric, red paint being thrown against a wall. It's not blood. \"God, we went to Taylor's show – it was really violent!\"\nWhat did you do today? I was wondering what you do on a day when you play a show like this.\nIt's a pretty hectic day. And it started with two really big meals. I eat a really big breakfast.\nWhen is your first one?\nThat's at 10 a.m. And then I drive to the venue, get to the venue. We did soundcheck with Patrick Stump from Fall Out Boy. I've been so excited for it for so long, because that song has been my jam for a really long time. Anyways, I did soundtrack with Patrick Stump and ran a few things in the stadium and then went to catering and had a really big lunch.\nWhat'd you eat?\nI don't know, just whatever they have, because that's gotta carry me through pretty much the show and the meet-and-greets, because hair and makeup starts at 4:30, and then I have four different meet-and-greets before the show. And then before the show we have a huddle where one of us makes an inspirational speech. Patrick's the one who made it tonight, which was wonderful. And then we go and walk into a stadium and play a show for two hours.\nAfter the Speak Now tour, this one even seems a little bigger. You have the levitating and the Victorian dresses and the chandeliers. Did you have a specific way of thinking on  what this tour would be like?\nI did, actually. I thought a lot about how this tour was going to be different from the Speak Now tour. I was really proud of the Speak Now tour, but I'm proud of this tour for a different reason. When I was conceptualizing this tour from the very beginning, I thought about how if these two shows were to exist in two different worlds, I picture the Speak Nowtour existing in a Midsummer Night's Dream/Romeo and Juliet-inspired fantasyland, and I picture this taking place in New York City. And so you've got high intensity excitement and you've got the darkness of all of it and you've got all the fleeting moments of reality, and it's a little bit less of a fairy tale.\nEd Sheeran has opened all the shows on the tour, but you are also rotating lots of other openers like Austin Mahone, Joel Crouse, Florida Georgia Line – kind of like your own traveling festival.\nI have a pretty wide, eclectic taste in music, and I know my fans do too. We seem to have that in common. I want fans to leave the show at the end of the night with their heads spinning from everything they saw and heard. I want them to fall in love with a new artist as much as I want them to fall in love with ballet or dubstep or musical theater, and all of the other elements in the Red show they may not have seen before. Variety in entertainment can be so inspiring, and that's why I like to create different worlds with each song. It's why I like surprising the crowd with special guest performances they didn't expect. The fans have made my world a magical place to live in, and I guess this tour is me trying to do the same for them.\nDoes giving these acts a shot have any connection to the idea that a lot of acts, like Rascal Flatts, Kenny Chesney and Tim McGraw, gave you a chance early on?\nI'll never forget the people who gave me a chance to open up for them early on in my career. When I was a teenager, my biggest lessons came from Kenny Chesney, Tim McGraw, George Strait, Rascal Flatts and Brad Paisley. I learned so much from opening up for those artists, and it also taught me how to treat your opening acts and make them feel like they're part of a family, not just a tour. It's why we all hang out so much and go out to dinner and celebrate our achievements together. For me, it was the coolest feeling in the world when I realized Austin, Ed and I had all gotten nominated for VMAs. I'm so proud of them.\nHow do you feel you have grown as a performer, especially in stadiums?\nI feel like you have to push yourself in order to become a better performer, and I never want a fan to leave the show saying, \"That was just like the last tour.\" I like touring extensively because I think the more hours you spend onstage, the more you know who you are onstage. The more you throw yourself out of your comfort zone in the studio, the more colors you have to paint with when you go into the design stages of your tour. At the end of the day, the sound of a screaming crowd is my favorite sound, and the sight of a sold-out stadium is my favorite view. Everything derives from that and revolves around making those people dance, sing along, feel like they aren't alone, and ultimately want to come back and see me next time.\nWhat are some of the weirder thoughts going through your head onstage during the show? \nTonight I was particularly hung up on not chipping another tooth like last show in Pittsburgh, definitely. It had a tip on [the tooth] and it doesn't anymore. I try to be really quick with the microphone, so I'm not standing there just waiting to sing with my mic right next to my face, so I really quickly pulled my mic up to sing and basically uppercut punched myself in the tooth. And then part of it fell onto the stage and I was like, \"Oh, I wonder how bad that was. I wonder which tooth that is and I wonder how bad that is,\" and I was just trying not to chip another one tonight. I'm not doing anything about it. It's just gonna be a little bit jagged, I guess.\nSometimes I get really caught up in reading the signs, and if I get too caught up I will start to read the signs when I'm singing, so I have to make sure I'm only reading signs in musical breaks. [The signs] are all pretty out there most of the time, which I like. There will be people who just make a giant, huge picture of my cat's face, so big that it's all I can see, and that usually gets my attention. My cat out there, giant photocopy of her, eight foot by eight foot.\nYou're at home, basically.\nRight – \"this is so cozy!\"\nYou walk through the crowd during \"Sparks Fly.\" Is that scary, having thousands of people trying to get to you?\nNo. You know, you get scratched a little bit, but that's nothing to be scared of. It's really cool to make eye contact with someone while you're singing. To be able to travel through the entire crowd and sort of surprise people who didn't think they were going to get up close to a performance – I think that's one of my favorite things about having a stage in different parts. It's kind of exhilarating actually, walking through a crazy, insane mob of people.\nYou posted some images from your Fourth of July party you had this summer. What are your other favorite offstage moments of the summer so far? \nI think the Fourth of July was way up there, just because anytime there's face-painting and frolicking involved, I'm really excited about all of those things. I've loved really being with my girlfriends a lot. Like, there have been a lot of kitchen dance parties with my girlfriends. The wonderful thing about playing a lot of stadiums is it's the equivalent to playing three or four arenas, so you have a few more days off. So I've really enjoyed getting to have a summer and also have a really high-intensity job waiting for me.\nSo you've been hanging out in Rhode Island a lot?\nI've been in Rhode Island a lot. I've been in L.A. a little bit. Man, Rhode Island's a good place. It's a really good place.\nAre you reading or listening to anything at the moment that you're excited about?\nI'm going back and revisiting Carly Simon a lot. I'm listening to a lot of Carly Simon. And I have a copy of [F. Scott Fitzgerald's] Tender Is the Night that I'm about to start reading, because I read it a long time ago and I want to reread it. I've been reading a lot of different things, but I really like [Gillian Flynn's] Gone Girl and [Jess Walters'] Beautiful Ruins. They're great stories. They kind of take you away.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Rolling Stone: Taylor Swift: 'Floodgates Open' for Next Album\nSinger has a list of collaborators for 'Red' follow-up\nOn Saturday, Taylor Swift brought her massive stadium spectacle to New Jersey's MetLife Stadium,  surprising 55,000 shrieking fans by inviting Fall Out Boy's Patrick Stump onstage for \"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)\" and hovering over the crowd on a platform during \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\" Backstage after the show, Swift toldRolling Stone she is already looking ahead to her next album, the follow-up to last year's Red.\n\"The floodgates just opened the last couple weeks,\" she says of the songwriting process. \"I'm getting to that point where I'm irritating to be around because I'll be with you for half the conversation and then the second half of the conversation I'm clearly editing the second verse of whatever I'm writing in my head.\"\nOn Red, Swift experimented with pop collaborations, writing with hitmakers like Max Martin, Shellback and Dan Wilson. And she already has a list of artists she wants to work with on her next LP.\n\"I really loved collaborating,\" she says. \"You work with a lot of different people and you find the people you have this dream connection with in the studio. I know those people and I know the ones I want to go back to. But I also have a really long list of the people I admire and I would really love to go and contact. So that's kind of where that is.\"\nBut one thing is for sure: she's not looking to repeat Red.\n\"I think that the idea of having a different approach to every single one of my albums is so exciting to me. I never want to make the same record twice. Why do it? What's the point? It's so overwhelming that when you're starting a project there are such endless possibilities if you're willing to evolve and experiment. If you're willing to become a different version of yourself, you can really go anywhere with it. And that's kind of where I am. The kind of the laboratory experimental stage of really catching onto a new thing that I'm liking.\"\nAnd what is that 'new thing'?\n\"I can't tell you,\" she says with a smile.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: Endless Talent— Caras Magazine interview.\nTaylor, what are your best memories about growing up on a Christmas tree farm:\nThat I always had space to run and that I had the opportunity to play with my imagination. I also loved that my mum drew and painted with me. I always remember that my parents loved me, and that is essential when you're a kid; they always showed me how proud they were of my achievements. It's also very important when parents put their kids' drawings on the refrigerator (laughs)\nWhat games did you like to play:\nI loved to dress up and sing standing in front of lots of people and act as if I were in a theatre; and build a fortress. For me, being a kid was a lot of fun! And I believe that we all need to keep on being kids on the inside and be grateful for all the little things that we have in this life.\nHow was your personality when you were a kid? We know that you loved singing since you were almost a baby:\nI was a very observant kid, and I tried to learn everything that I could. I was a very verbal kid, I was talking before I was even walking. I always wanted to know the \"why\" of everything, my mum says that I asked lots of questions.\nHow did you find yourself interested in music:\nI was interested in music before I even knew what music was. I started to sing when I was one, two, three years old...and singing was something that I've always loved, without question. I started to act in children plays because my parents realized that every time I could, I would stand up in front of people and sing to them. I believe that acting in those plays still influences the way I plan my shows today, because everything in them is so theatrical and I like to tell a story with characters, and you can see that in my shows.\nWhich was the first instrument that you learned how to play:\nThe guitar. I was 12 at that time. We always had a piano in the house and I could play it whenever I wanted to, but I started to sing first with the guitar. I learned to play the 12 strings guitar, someone told me that it was harder to learn with that one, but I kept trying and I made it. When I decide to do something, I don't stop until I get it right.\nWhat role did your family and friends play in your success:\nMy family has played a very important role, because they have always helped me keep myself grounded and as \"normal\" as possible. They have helped me so that my priority is to keep a normal life while living in abnormal circumstances. My parents are always honest with me, even telling me things that I don't want to hear and that's very important to me, because if I were surrounded by people who only tell me what I want to hear all the time, I would be living in a world in which I would feel that I'm the only one who lives in it. And I believe that nobody should live in that world.\nWhat do you admire in your parents:\nIn my dad, I admire his positive attitude and his love for everything he does. He loves being a stockbroker as much as I love being an artist. In my mum, I admire her organization, the way she solves her problems, her compassion towards other people and how she makes everything very quickly (laughs). She can decorate a full house in one week, or organize a party in a very short time, and things like that... She is very good solving problems.\nWe know that you don't get drunk, you don't have scandals like other celebrities do. What is the reason for that? How do you do it:\nMy family is not the kind that keep on saying \"Don't do this or that\"; the thing is that I don't want to disappoint them. And my dad always tells me that before I make a decision about something, to think about whether I would regret it when I'm 80 or not, and if I thought I would regret it, then not to do it. I know that we always make mistakes, we can't avoid them, but the best way to try to avoid them is to think of how I would see them in the future.\nWhat are your three bigger strengths and weakness:\nI'm trustworthy, friendly and curious. My weakness are that I'm too trusting, I think about things too much and I get stressed a lot.\nWhat makes you happy, and what makes you feel sad:\nThe little and simple things make me happy. I like going to the supermarket and buying the ingredients to cook dinner for someone. I like painting, I like making gifts for my friends' birthdays, and I like writing letters to people. I think those things keep me sane.\nOne of the things that makes me sad is kids with cancer, that usually makes me cry. When I see those kids at my meets-and-greets I think that they shouldn't be sick like this. My day changes, and the way I looks at things changes too. Another thing that makes me sad is when hunters kill endangered species; that frustrates me. When people with tragic come to my meet-and-greets that makes me sad too. One time, someone told me that they had just lost their dad in an accident.. Another time a mother told me that she has just lost her daughter and that the girl used to love my music, so she wanted to tell me about her... There are so many bad and unexpected things that can happen to any of us..that each day we should be grateful if nothing big happened to us.\nWhat do you consider to be your biggest achievement:\nWinning a Grammy for Album of the Year (2010). I was fortunate to have won it while being so young.\nWhat is the thing that you appreciate more in a friend:\nThey have to like to have fun, and they must know and be able to have fun even while doing nothing exciting. They must laugh about the same things I do..and they should be open and honest, because I can't have friends that don't talk about what they are going through.\nWhat are you looking for in a partner:\nRight now, I don't know. I thought I knew, but looking back, I don't think I'm looking for a relationship right now. I think that maybe, what I need is to take some time to realize what is what I really want.\nWhat kind of movies do you like to watch the most:\nThose that make you think about life, and what life is really about. I like 500 Days Of Summer and Love Actually. I also like historical movies like Saving Private Ryan and Forrest Gump.",

This tour is a little bit more of a reality based show. You know, it's like less fairy-tales and princesses. Actually, zero fairy-tales and princesses in this one. So I think that as I've grown up, I've tried to do that gradually. Like year by year just kind of grow up along with my career, and this tour is something I'm very proud of.\nInterviewer: I don't know if you're aware of it, but your the first female artist to do a stadium tour since Madonna, 20 or more years ago. Did you know that?\nTaylor: I think any comparison to her is incredible. Any time, you know, being mentioned in the same breath because she is such an amazing entertainer so I'm very happy about that.\nInterviewer: I thought that was very cool bringing Carly Simon up on stage to do 'You're So Vain', must have been an absolute boost for both of you.\nTaylor: Oh, it was a dream! Carly Simon is one of my favorite artist, and I just feel like if you were to ask me what's the most perfectly written song in the history of songs, it would be 'You're So Vain', so getting to sing that with her? It was just...it was a dream.\nInterviewer: Did she tell you who she wrote it for?\nTaylor: Yeah! Definitely, but I can't-I'm sworn not to tell! I think it's like a huge deal if you tell her you're not gonna tell, and you tell a national news program.\nInterviewer: So I have a bit of a cheating question, who are you singing it for?\nTaylor: Who was I singing it for? Oh, I know, I'm impressed that you asked it, but um, but I'm not *chuckles* not going to answer it.\nInterviewer: I think Pat R. from Rolling Stone Magazine who described the Red Tour as 'massively excellent'. That's kinda cool.\nTaylor: This is like the final piece of artistic creation or whatever you wanna call it. Like, when I start writing a song, that's the very first step, and then you take it to the studio, and then you put it out, and then it's on the radio. The final step is putting it altogether in a concert experience, and so, to get really great reviews has been wonderful.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Partial? Interviewer: Congrats on your new fragrance, Taylor! Could you tell us about it?\nTaylor: With Taylor, I was able to choose notes inspired by who I am at this moment. It's a little more sophisticated, but still care-free and playful.\nInterviewer: We're excited about seeing you perform. How will this tour be different?\nTaylor: Fans can expect the unexpected. I wanted the show for the RED Tour to be completely different. I think the visuals portrayed on this tour is more grown up. On my previous tours, I've liked to operate on the element of fantasy, and I think this tour incorporates a little more reality into the visuals.\nInterviewer: We know it's top-secret, but what surprises do you have planned for the Australian leg?\nTaylor: I have lots of surprises for my Aussie fans, but I can not give away those secrets!\nInterviewer: Do you have any preshow rituals?\nTaylor: I have this great routine with Caitlin, my fiddle player. We sit in front of the make-up mirrors in my dressing room and do our hair and make-up together while we've got fun music blasting. Every once in awhile, we have an impromptu dance party, but I just really love spending that time with her as close friends. Then we get to go on stage and perform together. It's a really great feeling.\nInterviewer: Is there anything that frustrates you about being famous?\nTaylor: No. I still have the 'I still can't believe this is my life' moment, daily. A fan will come up to me in a grocery store or at a show and say something-tell me some story about how my music has affected their life- and I'll stop and say to myself, \"I can't believe I get to be apart of that person's life. That person that I didn't meet until today.\" I feel really lucky that people I haven't necessarily met get to share my thoughts, my stories, and my experiences.\nInterviewer: What's the best advice you have ever received?\nTaylor: To go with my gut feeling. I have a lot of people I trust around me. I know my mom and dad will always tell me their honest opinion if I can't make up my mind. I don't feel the need to change who I am, because I don't think I can carry that kind of burden all the time.\nInterviewer: What is the coolest thing about your fans?\nTaylor: Getting to stand on stage and sing my own words and stories to giant crowds is the best feeling. So many of the fans I meet are just like me- fasinated, confused, and frustrated by love, but it's all we think about. I love talking to my fans. They've been so good to me, and I can't wait for them to see the RED tour. I love coming to Australia! There's a warm energy there, and I'm so happy to get to visit so often. I want to let the fans know I love them and I appreciate the love they've shown.\nInterviewer: What's the coolest thing about attending award shows?\nTaylor: The memories. I think if you're lucky enough to have happy memories that make you smile every time you think of them, you should think of them often. I look back on the award shows when I'm having a tough day. I never expected all of this to happen. I'll never stop appreciating these moments.\nInterviewer: What has been your favorite red carpet look?\nTaylor: The BRITS 2013. I loved the black dress and straight hair.\nInterviewer: If you could edit your past, what would you change?\nTaylor: Nothing. I've had a lot of obstacles pop up in front of me. Every day something goes wary and I have to choose how to handle it. The hardest lesson for me has been learning that even when you want something really bad and for all the right reasons, even if you work incredibly hard for something, there's no guarantee things will go your way. You have to deal with a lot of rejection. I am proud that I never let rejection cause me to stop trying to do this. I have regrets, but even my mistakes have played a part in getting me to where I am now, and right now I'm happy.\nInterviewer: What keeps you awake at night?\nTaylor: A song idea that might hit me in the middle of the night and I grab my phone and record the idea so I can go back to it the next day.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift talks next album, CMAs and Ed Sheeran\nNASHVILLE, TENN. — \nThe 23-year-old pop star was honored for a record sixth time as songwriter-artist of the year by the Nashville Songwriters Association International, surpassing guys like Vince Gill and Alan Jackson. She earned the award with 14 hits in the top 30 over the last year, a tribute to the popularity of her multiplatinum fourth album, “Red.”\n\nAs Swift accepts the award, she’s six months deep in the songwriting process for her next album.\n\n\"I think the goal for the next album is to continue to change, and never change in the same way twice,\" the seven-time Grammy winner said. \"How do I write these figurative diary entries in ways that I’ve never written them before and to a sonic backdrop that I’ve never explored before? It’s my fifth album, which is crazy to think about, but I think what I’m noticing about it so far is it’s definitely taking a different turn than anything I’ve done before.\"\n\nSwift sat down with The Associated Press after the Saturday ribbon-cutting on the new $4 million Taylor Swift Education Center at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in her adopted hometown to talk about what’s to come with the new album, her six Country Music Association Award nominations, her friend and fellow Nashville resident Ed Sheeran and Madonna.\n\nAP: Next month you leave on a stadium tour of Australia, making you the first female solo performer to tour that country since Madonna 20 years ago. Madonna was the top pop star in the world at the time. Do you see yourself as that kind of pop star?\n\nSwift: I would never see myself that way. I see myself as kind of this girl who writes songs in her bedroom. You can kind of dress it up all you want and you can put together an amazing theatrical production, you can become a better performer as time goes by, and you can try to excite people, but I’m always going to be a girl who writes songs in her bedroom in my own personal perception of myself. And I think it’s important that I don’t necessarily think too hard about what everybody else’s perception of me is or else I’d just get completely lost in it. It’s just easier to think of myself that way.\n\nAP: You’re up for entertainer of the year again at the CMAs on Nov. 6. If you win, you’ll become the first woman with three wins, passing Barbara Mandrell. How do you feel about that?\n\nSwift: I think winning entertainer of the year would be an unbelievable thing to happen in my life because I still sometimes can’t believe I’ve gotten to win that twice. So a third time, what I think it would mean for my fans, would be the biggest feeling I would have. Just knowing the, I think, 1.3 million people we saw this year in the U.S. would get to know that they contributed to that and that they being frenzied and covering themselves in Christmas lights and making signs and learning the lyrics and screaming at the top of their lungs and dancing for two hours straight at my show somehow moved the needle and impacted my life in a way that I’ll remember when I’m 85 if I get to be 85.\n\nAP: You said recently you’ve been working on songs for the new album for about six months. What can you tell us about what you have planned?\n\nSwift: It’s too early to tell who are going to be my predominant collaborators, but I do know that my absolute dream collaborators were Shellback and Max Martin on the last project. I’ve never been so challenged as a songwriter. I’ve never learned so much. I’ve never just been so excited to show up to the studio every day, just because you never know what we’re going to put together. I’ll bring in ideas and they’ll take such a different turn than where I thought they were going to go, and that level of unexpected spontaneity is something that really thrills me in the process of making music. … What if we did this? What if we made it weirder? What if we took it darker? I love people who have endless strange and exciting ideas about where music can go.\n\nAP: How far are you willing to push the boundaries of your sound?\n\nSwift: I definitely think that with music my favorite thing about Nashville is that it’s a music hub that accepts and allows all genres to be present, and I think there’s been a kind of fusing of genres lately that for me makes me really happy and excited. I am blown away at getting six CMA nominations in a year that I pushed the boundaries of what a genre is more than ever before. I’m so happy that people understood what I was doing conceptually. Getting those six CMA nominations to me signified that this community knew that I was not running from where I come from. I was exploring, and I think the more people who know what country music is, the more people will gravitate toward Nashville.\n\nAP: Speaking of Nashville, I think you convinced your friend Ed Sheeran to move here …\n\nSwift: Oh, I definitely did. Ed loves Nashville. You know, so many people live here now. It’s really exciting because nobody who comes here … doesn’t like it, and it just makes me proud to live here and it makes me proud to make music here and I love it. I just love it becoming such an exciting place to live after eight years.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Train frontman Pat Monahan has started writing songs for the band's next album, and when that finally arrives, it just may have a song on it that he co-wrote with Taylor Swift.  But according to Pat, yet another tune the two wrote together may show up even sooner than that.\n\nPat tells ABC News Radio that when he told Taylor that he wanted to collaborate with her on a song for Train's next album, she asked him to write a song with her for her album, Red. The track didn't make the album, but Pat says eventually, when Taylor puts out a deluxe re-released version of Red, \"the song, I think, will be on there.\"\n\n\"It's a song called 'Babe,'\" continues Pat. \"So it's her song; I was just lucky enough to be a part of it with her, and I'm gonna ask the same of her in the future.\" \n\nWhile Pat has quite a few years on Taylor when it comes to songwriting experience, he says he's full of admiration for her talents.  \"She's very talented, she's a no-nonsense young kid,\" Pat tells ABC News Radio. \"Y'know, she's, like, a serious thing.\" \n\nPat says he also appreciates the fact that Taylor has so much skill at writing songs about topics that he doesn't even consider.  \"I'm not going through different relationships and breakups and all the stuff that young people do, so her perspective is very fresh,\" he says. \"And I think that that's what I admire the most [about her].\"  \n\nBack in March, Pat joined Taylor onstage during her RED tour, and the two duetted on Train's hit \"Drive By.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Exclusive: Taylor Swift Talks Fashion Regrets, Style Crushes, and Her Must-Have Red Lipstick\nBy Joanna Douglas, Senior Fashion and Beauty Editor | Fashion – Mon, Nov 4, 2013 3:57 PM EST\n\nPop sensation Taylor Swift may get constant press for her tumultuous love life, but here at Yahoo Shine, we're obsessed with the star for another reason: her personal style. From her pitch-perfect off-duty wardrobe to her glam taste in red carpet gowns, Swift dresses as flawlessly as her enviable bangs and gorgeous red lips look.\n\nWhile she prepares for a crazy whirlwind schedule that includes an international tour, the American Music Awards, the Country Music Awards, and an upcoming album, Swift has also been collaborating with Keds, the iconic sneaker brand, on covetable comfortable shoes. We sat down with the star to get the scoop on her style icons, the best and worst things she's ever worn, and her beauty secrets.\n\nYahoo Shine: Your red carpet style has really evolved over the years. What's your favorite look of all time?\nTaylor Swift: I wore a gown to the Brits [in February] that was a black [Elie Saab] dress, and it had a belt, and I had a smoky makeup look. That was one of my favorites.\n\nDo you have any fashion regrets from the past?\n\nI started walking red carpets when I was 16. I think since I missed prom so many times, I would wear prom-like dresses. Princessy-, pastels… I can't remember a specific one, I just see them all as a blur. [Laughs] Please don't put a big picture of them in your article like, \"A slideshow of Taylor's terrible prom choices!\" [Editor's note: Sorry, Taylor. We had to show just one!]\n\nHave stylists ever introduced you to something you didn't think you'd wear that you now love?\n\nI remember the first time my stylist brought in a pair of high-waisted shorts. I was like, \"Oh, what is that? No! Get it away from me!\" And then I put a pair on and I was like, \"I love this!\" I ended up wearing them onstage all the time.\n\nWhat style tip would you share with our readers?\n\nI feel bossy telling people what to do, but I think the best option for what to wear is something that won't make you cringe in 20 years, like passing trends. When everybody's wearing neon, I'm not. When everybody's got spikes on everything, I'm not doing that. When everybody's trying to look tough, I'm not. When you ignore fads and just wear what you like that's classic and simple, I think that's the way to go for longevity as far as style is concerned.\n\nTaylor Swift and her style crush, Lena Dunham, have a moment at the Billboard Awards\nTaylor Swift and her style crush, Lena Dunham, have a moment at the Billboard Awards\nWhich of your peers do your think has great style?\n\nI always like what Lena [Dunham] wears, because it's always so her. She knows how to dress in a way that represents her personality. It's so perfect, because she's just being herself with her fashion choices, and I think that's my favorite thing. It's very brave to showcase who you are by what you wear.\n\nWho are your style icons?\n\nDo you know who Cyd Charisse is?\n\nYup! [Editor's note: Cyd Charisse was a beautiful actress and dancer during the 1940s and '50s who performed alongside Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly.]\n\nShe is my favorite right now. I keep looking at photos of her looking so classic. She's my style icon of the moment. I always waver between Audrey Hepburn, Francoise Hardy or Jane Birkin.\n\nTaylor Swift wore sequin polka dot Keds on her \nTaylor Swift wore sequin polka dot Keds on her\nWe've seen you wear polka dot Keds onstage and in your free time. What's a surprising offbeat way to wear these sneakers?\n\nI wear Keds to kind of kick around in. I wear them to the gym and to dance class, or to the beach or for a walk. For me, it's very nostalgic. It reminds me of my childhood, because I used to always wear white Keds when I was a little kid. It reminds me of being young, and if I'm going anywhere that seems playful or fun, that's when I put on my Keds.\n\nWhat's your favorite Keds design?\n\nI love the nautical knot themed ones (available in spring 2014) and the floral print. Those are my favorites. In the summertime, I always go for the polka dot, because that's a summer thing for me. I'm obsessed with polka dots.\n\nTaylor loves these nautical-themed Keds due out in 2014 \nTaylor loves these nautical-themed Keds due out in 2014\nWhat's your current go-to outfit on a day off?\n\nWhen I'm just kind of wandering around, I really like skinny jeans and a sweater. And I'll throw on some maroon or darker colored Keds during fall and winter. The black velvet ones  are nice for nighttime.\n\nWhat's your go-to outfit for a night out?\n\nUsually I'll wear a dress and tights, or a little skirt with tights and a sweater. This sweater weather is my obsession right now.\n\nWhat's your typical beauty regimen?\n\nMy makeup artist does my look for concerts, but when I'm doing it myself, I have to make a choice: Is it going to be a heavy eye look or a heavy lip look? If I'm gonna do a red lip, I'll do a simple cat eyeliner look. But if it's going to be a smoky eye, I'll do a nude lip or barely any color on the lip. You don't ever want to appear like you're wearing too much makeup. If you have a heavy eye and a heavy lip, people are like, \"Wow, what are you covering up?\"\n\nIs there anything you do to pamper yourself or wind down?\n\nI love baths, and I love listening to music alone in my house. For me, that's the extent of my luxurious activities. I don't do manicures, pedicures, facials, or massages really.\nWait a minute. You don't do your nails?!\n\nI paint them.\n\nOh, you paint them yourself.\n\nYeah! [Laughs.] I don't know. I'm like a 7-year-old. I don't really have the patience to sit there with my hands not moving for 20 minutes. I find luxury in very simple things.\n\nWhat is your must-have beauty item when traveling on tour?\n\nI always have something for red lips.\n\nYou're sort of known for that! What's your favorite red lipstick shade?\n\nThere's a Make Up For Ever lip stain that's really good. It's red lip stain on one side and gloss on the other. [Editor's note: It's Aqua Rouge in Iconic Red, $24]\n\nYour bangs are always so perfect — they're actually very Jane Birkin! How often do you trim them?\n\nOh, thank you! It's been something like three weeks and they're really long now. Usually when I'm on tour, I get them trimmed every two weeks so they don't get in my eyes. I'm letting them grow, and I think I'll know when the time is right to cut them.\n\nWhat item do you always have in your purse?\n\nI always have several cameras because I love taking pictures…They're digital, but sometimes I like the classic Polaroids.\n\nIs there anything unusual on your tour rider?\n\nNo! Riders are so funny. I don't even think I have one!\n\nYou don't ask for any candles or special foods or anything like that?\n\nNo! The only thing I like to have is water.\n\n(photos: Getty Images, WENN & courtesy of Keds)",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Taylor: Life would be boring if it was easy\n\nTaylor Swift spills all on riding through life's highs and lows\n\nAs she brings the Red Tour to Oz, we got to chat to Taylor about everything from how to get through tough times in high school, to how to fake your way to confidence, her friendship with Selena (spoiler alert - Miss Gomez knows who ALL Taylor's songs are about!) and her cute kitty Meredith!\n\nWhat do you most love about coming to Australia? \n\"Australia is one of my favourite places to tour! I love the friendly people, the accents, the beautiful weather, the incredible scenery, and, of course, the food is great.\"\n\nWhat can we expect to see at the shows? \n\"Expect the unexpected! I like the element of surprise and I love to include it in the show\" \n\nWhat's your hope for fans when they listen to your music? \n\"It's important to realine that life would be boring if it was easy. I've learned something really freeing in life: when it comes to love, I know absolutely nothing. Even though I've been in relationships and seen all kinds of ways they can start and end, I've realised there is no pattern to love. It will never be predictable. And I will never have it all figured out. I get inspired by good times and bad times. I've written songs I'm very proud of when I was having the worst day ever, but I'm equally inspired by beautiful days too.\" \n\nSelena Gomez recently said, \"I think girls need to be supportive of each other. Taylor has been one of those girls.\" What makes Selena a great friend to you? \nShe's one of my best friends and we really connect on lots of levels. We're there for each other through good times and bad. It's so much fun to play her my new songs because she can tell who each is about without me even telling her.\" \n\nWhat's your number one friendship tip? \"Honesty. Selena and I are like sisters. We tell each other everything and laugh for hours about stupid inside jokes we've had for years. She knows my quirks and I know hers. It's so great to have a friend who knows your storyline\"\n\nWhat advice would you give your 15-year-old self? \nI would say absolutely nothing. lessons in life. I wouldn't want to comfort myself or say something like, Those mean girls don't matter, because it DID matter to me back then and caused me a lot of pain. I used that pain as inspiration behind my songs, and it became something productive in my life that helped me accomplish my dreams\" \n\nWhat did you find most challenging in high school? \n\"When I was in school, I just wanted to fit in. I was teased a lot because I was always off singing and the other kids looked at that as weird' or 'showing off. I was on the volleyball team, but I wasn't good at that either (to everyone's surprise, because I'm really tall). I loved talking to my friends about boys and clothes and school dances. When I think of school, I think about gradually, by trial and error, figuring out who you are\" \n\nWhat's your number one confidence tip? \n\"Acting confident goes a long way towards actually BEING confident. Just throw your shoulders back and hold your head up-it really works.\" \n\nHow do you stay happy with the world watching? \n\"I'm really happy right now. Happiness is the biggest priority for me above everything else, it's crucial. Everyone just wants to be happy, regardless of the criteria. At the centre of it all is the desire to be content.\" \n\nAny plans for new music? \nI'm always writing music. I learn about myself through writing. Sometimes I don't even know how I feel until I write it down. Then it all makes sense to me.\n\n\"Love Story\" was your breakout hit five years ago. Where do you see yourself five years from now? \"I hope I'm still making music, but who knows where my life will take me. I just hope I'm as happy as I am now.\" \n\nThe Fast Five :\nMy best beauty tip ever is... You can use powder to set your foundation and also your lipstick. You powder your lipstick to malce it last, and it pretty much achieves the same effect as a lip stain. I'm a big fan of lip stains and anything that makes my life a little more simple.\nMy favourite thing to bake right now is.... Pumplan chocolate-chip cookies. \nThe person I call for advice when I'm having a bad day is... My mum \nInside my dressing room you'll find... My fiddle player, Caitlin (we still share a dressing room); my cat. Meredith, hanging out, a comfy couch, Diet Coke and lots of water! \nMy favourite thing that Meredith does right now is... \"I toss her a treat and she catches it with her paws.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift worries a lot about security. It’s an understandable concern. This spring, a man was arrested in the wee hours of the morning near her estate in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. Police reportedly spotted him walking out of the ocean; he told the arresting officers he had swum two miles to meet Taylor Swift. The singer has two other homes—a modest house, which she calls a “cottage,” in ­Beverly Hills, and her main residence, a penthouse apartment near downtown Nashville—and her team makes every effort to keep the addresses hush-hush. But fans have a way of sniffing these things out. On a Sunday morning in late September, a 12-year-old girl and her mother, who had flown to Nashville from Connecticut to see Swift’s concert at the Bridgestone Arena the night before, walked into the lobby of her building. This was celebrity stalking at its most benign: The mom and daughter had a gift for Swift, a big container of homemade chicken soup, which they left with her doorman.\n\nSwift needed the soup. When I arrived at her apartment later that day—my visit was scheduled—she was audibly under the weather. She looked the picture of health: She greeted me in her big, open-plan kitchen, wearing a loose-fitting white-lace frock and friendly grin. But when she spoke, what came out was a croak, a husky voice pitched about two octaves lower than Bea Arthur’s. “I made these, and I’m super-proud of them,” she said, pushing a plate of cookies across the counter. “They’re pumpkin-chocolate-chip. I didn’t cough on them, just so you know. You’re safe.”\n\nSwift had been sick all week, fighting the kind of head cold best treated by curling up in bed with a magnum of NyQuil. She didn’t have that luxury. She’d come home to Nashville to wrap up a seven-month-long North American tour in support of her fourth album, Red, which was released in October 2012. The concert the previous evening was the final one of the tour, and the toughest. “It was a struggle,” she said. “I found it a little bit easier to sing than to talk, which was, like, a miracle.”\n\nIn fact, Swift’s cold had provided one of the show’s Kodak moments. About halfway through, she settled in front of a microphone to perform her 2010 hit “Sparks Fly.” Suddenly, she thought better of it. “I’m sorry, guys, but I just really have to blow my nose,” she said. “I swear I’m gonna do this really fast, can you please scream to fill the awkward silence, please?” She scurried down a flight of steps offstage, where, presumably, a roadie was waiting with Kleenex.\n\nFor another star, the move would be inconceivable: a mystique-shattering breach of the fourth wall. Can you imagine imperial Beyoncé or imperious Lady Gaga telling a sold-out arena: Hang on a sec, I’ve gotta go snort into a napkin? But for Swift it was a coup de théâtre. The crowd—14,000 plus, mostly female—erupted in a deafening, inhuman roar. Twenty seconds later, Swift was back onstage, strumming her twelve-string acoustic guitar and singing “Sparks Fly.”\n\nSwift’s Red tour is her biggest yet, and it has all the trappings of a stadium-pop blockbuster. There are Jumbotrons and LED lights, multilevel stages and hydraulics and confetti drops, a seven-piece band, four backup singers, fifteen dancers, nearly as many costume changes. Yet the heart of a Taylor Swift show is intimacy: moments like the tissue break, when the razzle-dazzle recedes, the band and dancers step into the shadows, and Swift bathes cavernous arenas in a homey campfire glow. Introducing “Mean,” a song about bullying, Swift stood at the lip of the stage, picking at a banjo. “I always wanted to know and I always used to daydream about what it would be like to stand on a really big stage and sing songs for a lot of people, songs that I had written … Daydreaming was kind of my No. 1 thing when I was little, because I didn’t have much of a social life going on. I didn’t always have 14,000 people wanting to hang out with me on a Saturday night.”\n\nThis is the signature Swift humble-brag, modesty that has at times seemed so false that it earned its own meme, the Taylor Swift Surprised Face—a reference to the What? Me?! gasps of astonishment she unleashed once too often when her name was called at awards ceremonies. Still, can you blame her for being shocked? The scale and scope of Swift’s success is startling. In an age of catastrophic music-industry contraction, Swift stands apart; sometimes she has seemed like a one-woman bulwark against the collapse of the traditional record business. In the seven years since the release of her self-titled debut, Swift has sold 26 million albums. Sales of Taylor Swift song downloads have topped 75 million; according to the Recording Industry Association of America, she is the No. 1 digital singles artist of all time. Since 2006, she has placed 43 songs in the Top 40 of Billboard’s Hot 100 pop chart as the lead performer, more than any other artist in that period. She’s had 31 Top 40 country singles, including thirteen No. 1’s.\n\nThese numbers are especially improbable when you consider the music, and the musician, behind them. Swift is an oddball. There is no real historical precedent for her. Her path to stardom has defied the established patterns; she falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends. She is a Pennsylvania Yankee turned teen-pop country singer, a Nashville star who crossed over to Top 40, a confessional singer-songwriter who masquerades as a global pop diva. Her music mashes up the quirkily homespun and the gleaming pop-industrial, Etsy and Amazon, in a way we’ve never quite heard before.\n\nSwift herself is a figure of contradictions. She’s a rock critic’s darling who hasn’t the faintest whiff of countercultural cool about her. Raunchiness is the norm in today’s pop, but Swift is prim, rated G. She is a model of can-do 21st-century girl power whose vision of romance is positively medieval—fairy-­princess, shining-knight, prancing-­unicorn medieval. She can write the sickly sweetest love song you’ve ever heard and churn out the most bilious, vindictive, name-naming, slut-­shaming breakup ballad; often, they’re the same song. Swift’s influence has reverberated through popular music, yet she remains sui generis, a genre of one. By rights, she should be a fringe figure, a cult artist. But as 2013 rounds the corner toward 2014, as Swift puts a bow on her fourth album and begins work on her fifth, there’s no mistaking it: Beyoncé, Rihanna, Gaga, Katy, Miley, ­Justin, Justin, Usher, Jay Z, Kanye—they’re all vying for second place. How, why, is Taylor Swift the world’s biggest pop star?\n\nThe best place to seek answers may be Nashville, the city that shapes Swift’s approach to art, business, and the intersection of the two. Her apartment, a three-bedroom corner duplex with soaring ceilings, sits more or less in the center of town, about two miles southwest of the Cumberland River, near the campus of Vanderbilt University. Swift did the interior design herself, a project she says took years to complete. It’s easy to see why. The apartment is a very pleasant, very visually busy place. There is a lot of décor for the eye to absorb.\n\nThere’s rustic hardwood furniture, Oriental rugs, a giant hearth where an electric fire flickers even when the temperature outside is in the high ­seventies. There are cabinets cluttered with books and tchotchkes; there’s a kitchen backsplash in the shape of a giant heart. In a corner near a window, there’s a topiary rabbit, as tall as an NBA shooting guard, wearing a marching-band hat. On the wall of her ­living room, I noticed a photograph in a gilded frame: the famous image of Kanye West, stage-crashing Swift’s acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. Underneath the picture is a caption, handwritten by Swift: Life is full of little interruptions.\n\nSwift’s ceilings are hung with all kinds of things: gathered silk, wooden birdcages, chandeliers, lanterns. Ornate railings line the apartment’s second-floor balconies; it looks like a stage set for a production of Romeo and Juliet—or for the scene in the final verse of Swift’s 2008 hit “Love Story.” In short, it’s exactly the kind of apartment you’d expect Taylor Swift to inhabit: whimsically girlie, dreamy, appointed in a style you might call Shabby-Chic Alice in Wonderland. Swift showed me one of the guest bedrooms, which holds an eye-popping cacophony of patterned wallpaper and ­fabrics. “I wanted, like, every color,” she said.\n\nSwift is a homebody. Even when she’s touring, she tries to sleep in her own bed, picking the shortest distance to one of her three residences and flying home in her private jet after shows. “It’s not a bad gig,” she deadpanned. You might not know it from her public persona, but Swift is funny; she has a dry, ready wit. I told her about the strange man who was seated next to me at the concert the night before. He looked to be in his early forties and was wearing a Taylor Swift T-shirt covered with Taylor Swift pin-back buttons. He announced that he was alone and had driven to Nashville from Oklahoma for the show; he filmed the whole concert on his phone, mouthing every word to every song with unnerving intensity. “He’s probably in a file somewhere,” Swift said.\n\nThe most impressive features of Swift’s apartment are the twenty-foot-high windows, which wrap around a corner of the building, offering panoramic views of Nashville. If you look out those windows to the west, you can see the famous epicenter of the country-music industrial complex, the strip of song-publishing firms, recording studios, and record labels known as Music Row.\n\nSwift first saw Music Row in 2001. At the time, the Swifts were living in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, near Reading, on an eleven-acre Christmas-tree farm that the family owned as a secondary ­business. (Her father, a successful stockbroker, worked for ­Merrill Lynch.) Taylor had discovered country music a few years earlier, when her parents bought her a LeAnn Rimes album. At age 11, ­Taylor persuaded her mother to take her to Nashville during spring break, so she could go door-to-door on Music Row, armed with a demo CD of karaoke performances.\n\nShe came up empty on that first trip, but three years later the family relocated to ­Hendersonville, Tennessee, an affluent suburb about twenty miles northeast of Nashville, so Taylor could pursue her musical dream. For once, it is not glib to say that the rest is history. In 2004, when she was 14, Swift signed a songwriting contract with Sony/ATV Nashville; she may have been the youngest professional songwriter in Music Row ­history. A year later, she inked a deal with Big Machine, a fledgling label run by ­former DreamWorks Nashville Records executive Scott ­Borchetta, and released her first album, Taylor Swift, in October 2006.\n\nRevisiting Swift’s debut, you’re reminded just how much of a country record it was. The lead single, “Tim McGraw,” tipped a Stetson to the ­country superstar; on the album cover, Swift looked like a mini-me version of McGraw’s wife, Faith Hill, whom she thanked in the liner notes “for being the most graceful woman in the world.” The songs were genre fare: lyrics about Chevy trucks and bedtime prayers and slammin’ screen doors, sung by Swift in a Dixie drawl, an accent she couldn’t possibly have picked up in the Keystone State.\n\nThere is a long tradition of country carpetbaggers: musicians from points north who squeeze into cowboy boots, start dropping their g’s, and make a beeline for Nashville to launch, or revitalize, their careers. The country star Alan Jackson lampooned the phenomenon in a 1994 hit, “Gone Country,” and the trend has been pronounced in recent years, with rockers like Sheryl Crow and Darius Rucker migrating to Nashville, one of the last places hospitable to guitar-based pop-rock in an era dominated by hip-hop.\n\nYou could make the case that Swift traveled that well-worn path herself. In fact, she did a bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop. With each album, her drawled vowels have become more clipped; she’s pushed the fiddles and mandolins down in the mix, or jettisoned them altogether. The tale is told by two of her biggest hits, “You Belong With Me” (2008) and “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” (2012). The former is a power-pop song with a country twang; banjos are prominent amid the surging guitars, and Swift still sounds like she’s a Southerner. (Listen to her sing the phrase “typical Tuesday night.”) “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” on the other hand, is a pure bubblegum-pop ditty, which Swift sings—and in funny asides, speaks—in a Valley Girl accent purged of all down-home traces. Good-bye, twang; hello, vocal fry.\n\nYet Swift’s ties to Nashville are still strong, crucial to her music and to what can only be called the Taylor Swift Brand. Radio is a major force in country, and Swift has remained a country-radio favorite the old-­fashioned grassroots way: by schmoozing and glad-handing ­station executives, ­program directors, and disc jockeys.\n\n“Country radio is much more like a family than any other group of people that I’ve met,” Swift said. “They just say, ‘Look, we’ve known each other for years. You’ve stood by us, and we’ve stood by you. That’s how this works.’ ”\n\nSwift has made splashier gestures toward the country Establishment. In October, the singer attended a gala ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Taylor Swift Education Center at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, which she personally endowed with a $4 million donation. “I love being a part of the country-music community,” she told me.\n\nThose feelings are, to say the least, reciprocated. Swift is ­Nashville’s sweetheart; it can’t stop lavishing her with accolades and honors. This fall, the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter/Artist of the Year for a record sixth time. She has been nominated for 21 Country Music Association Awards, and she’s won nine. Midway through this year’s CMAs ceremony, a phalanx of eight of the biggest stars in country—McGraw and Hill, George Strait, Brad Paisley, Keith Urban, and the three gaudily moussed simps in the trio Rascal Flatts—appeared onstage to present Swift with the Pinnacle Award, a ­special prize that had only been given out once before, to Garth Brooks. Brooks won his when he was 43; Swift turns 24 next month.\n\nThe Swift-Nashville love affair works for both sides. She is country’s first truly global star, its ambassador not just to the nation’s mall-rat hordes but to Ireland and Brazil and Taiwan. She confers modernity, cosmopolitanism, youth on a genre that traditionally has stood for the opposite values. The country Establishment may not be crazy about pop music, but it loves having a pop star in its midst, and is willing to follow Swift anywhere she goes, sending songs like “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” to No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs charts. Nashville barely even flinched when confronted with “I Knew You Were Trouble,” surely the only record with a dubstep bass-drop ever to get spins on country radio.\n\nFor Swift, Nashville offers plenty in return. The country audience is music’s most loyal and reliable; in a decade of record-industry decline, country sales figures have been notably more buoyant than other genres. Nashville turned out to be the perfect staging ground, the ideal base of operations, for Swift’s broader conquest of pop culture. If you ask Swift to reconcile her musical impulses, she gives an answer that has the virtue of being both true and politically savvy boilerplate. “I love country and I love pop,” she told me. “I love them both.”\n\nBut Swift’s relationship to country is not merely a matter of careerist calculation. Nashville is a song town, and Swift is first and foremost a songwriter, steeped in Music Row’s values of craftsmanship and storytelling. This was evident from the beginning, on Swift’s debut record, when listeners were amazed to hear a scrawny teenager—who in early publicity photos looked like she’d been awkwardly airdropped into a debutante’s ball gown—singing self-­written songs that showed such sure-footed command of form. Her songs had catchy verses that erupted into catchier singalong choruses, and the kinds of clever lyrical twists and switchbacks for which country songwriters are renowned. Her first country No. 1, “Our Song,” which she wrote for a talent contest as a high-school freshman, bounded out of the speakers, grabbing your ears from the first bar. The lyric was a little Mobius strip: a teenage romance tale, which looped around, in a nifty final verse, to Swift, the songwriter: “I grabbed a pen / And an old napkin / And I wrote down our song.” With each album, she’s refined her craft. Consider a refrain from another big hit, “Mine” (2010): “You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter.” That’s awfully deft writing: a little miracle of narrative concision, ­vacuum-packing a novel’s worth of backstory into ten words and two bars of music.\n\nSwift told me she could imagine a time when she’d stop performing and just be a writer. “When I’m 40 and nobody wants to see me in a sparkly dress anymore, I’ll be, like: ‘Cool, I’ll just go in the studio and write songs for kids.’ It’s looking like a good pension plan.”\n\nPerhaps. But Swift’s songwriting may be too quirky, too personal, to fit all comers. Swift’s parents named her after James Taylor, and she has a seventies-folkie’s soul; she is a confessor, a memoirist. On Red, Swift made the big leap into high-gloss pop, co-writing three songs with the wizardly Swedish hit-makers Max Martin and Johan “Shellback” Schuster, who are responsible for dozens of pop smashes over the last decade and a half. You could hear Martin and Shellback’s touch in the bright, punchy sound of those songs, “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” “I Knew You Were ­Trouble,” and “22.” Yet the songs are unmistakably Swiftian; unlike other Martin songs, you can’t imagine them being recorded, interchangeably, by Katy Perry, or Pink, or any of the other usual suspects. Listen to a key line in “22”: “We’re happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time / It’s miserable and magical.” It’s a classic Swift lyric: purple but precise, self-involved yet self-aware—all in all, about as spot-on a description of a young woman’s turbulent inner life as you’re likely to hear on hit radio.\n\n“I think that allowing yourself to feel raw, real emotions in public is something I am never going to be afraid to do,” she said. “Hopefully that’s the case, if I can remain a real human. I’m fine with being honest with my fans about the fact that it’s okay that everything isn’t okay all the time. I love my life, I love my career, I love my friends—but things are not okay all the time. So I don’t sing about things being okay all the time.”\n\nShe never has. The second song Swift ever wrote, when she was 12, was a lament about junior-high-school ostracism called “The Outside.” (The song appeared on Taylor Swift.) Swift quit Hendersonville High for good when she was 16, but her songs have never quite left the schoolyard: She still obsesses over castes and cliques and social hierarchies. In “22,” Swift sings about fleeing a party packed with “cool kids”; in “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” she scoffs at the ex-boyfriend who plays “some indie record that’s much cooler than mine.” One explanation for Swift’s immense popularity may be her insistence on playing the unpopular girl—36.7 million Twitter ­followers be damned. Other divas project invulnerability, striding through videos like jackbooted superheroines. Swift offers a different image. To put it in the teen-movie terms of “You Belong With Me”: In life Swift is, unmistakably, a “cheer captain”—blonde, leggy, confident, talented, and, oh, yeah, world famous. But in her songs she’s staked out a different persona: She’s a bleacher warmer, a wallflower, an underdog.\n\nSwift is best known, of course, for writing love songs, and lost love songs—and, especially, vengeful, scorched-Earth lost-love songs. The liner notes to her debut album included this dedication: “To all the boys who thought they would be cool and break my heart, guess what? Here are 14 songs written about you. HA.” Back then, the boys in question were Swift’s high-school classmates, but she’s since moved on to dating musicians and movie stars. These days, spotting-the-celeb in Taylor Swift’s lyrics is a favorite media parlor game.\n\nLike many famous people, Swift complains about the prying of tabloid gossips. In fact, she does a lot to encourage the attention. Accepting the Best Female Video award for “I Knew You Were Trouble” at the VMAs this August, Swift said: “I also want to thank the person who inspired this song, who knows exactly who he is”—a statement that unleashed a torrent of tweets about One Direction singer Harry Styles, the song’s reputed target.\n\nAt such moments, you can’t help but conclude that you are watching a shrewd businesswoman at work: It doesn’t hurt Swift’s bottom line to keep gossip mills whirring. But Swift’s vengeful streak has also brought censure—lots of it. She’s been maligned as a serial kisser-and-teller, as an entitled rich kid, as a mean girl with a victim complex. Swift can be shrill. When singer Joe Jonas dumped her and began dating actress Camilla Belle, Swift’s (alleged) response was “Better Than Revenge” (2010), a song that spent as much time shaming the girl as the rake (“She’s an actress / She’s better known / For things that she does / On the ­mattress”). “Dear John,” allegedly about Swift’s reported fling with John Mayer, had a delectable melody, but Swift’s self-righteousness, her immature insistence on her own immaturity—“Don’t you think I was too young / To be messed with?”—curdled the drink.\n\nSwift has heard the criticism, but she waves it off. “There’s a spin on every single celebrity out there,” she said. “I know that one of my spins is: ‘Oh, Taylor’s heartbroken. Oh, Taylor fell in love and the guy broke her heart. She’s sad all the time, and lonely.’ \n\n“I mean, they can say that all they want. Those are real feelings that every single person goes through. I think that it’s okay to be mad at someone who hurt you. This isn’t about, like, the pageantry of trying to seem like nothing affects you. I’m a songwriter. Everything affects me.”\n\n“I’m a songwriter,” surely, is the apt response. The tradition of musical score-settling stretches all the way back to medieval troubadours and lyre-plucking ancients; it’s been a mainstay of American song at least since the first bluesman aimed an acidic twelve-bars at the woman who’d done him wrong. Bob Dylan is an incorrigible, at times malicious, kisser-and-teller; for decades, rock critics have been quoting with admiration Elvis Costello’s famous dictum: “The only motivation points for me writing all these songs are revenge and guilt.” Drake’s new album Nothing Was the Same is, as usual, a vérité catalogue of his “bitches” and booty calls, in which he goes so far as to name one of his civilian exes, “Courtney from ­Hooters on Peachtree”—a creepier move by far than Swift’s sly swipes at her famous former beaux. It’s hard not to detect a sexist double standard in the policing of Swift’s confessions, especially when you consider the routine misogyny in the songs of rockers, rappers, and woebegone beardy indie balladeers. Taylor Swift is a young woman who dates guys, falls in love, falls out of love, and writes some songs about it. Must we begrudge Swift her muse?\n\nYou could call Swift a generational bard: She merges the ­pleasures of old-fashioned songcraft with millennial social-media oversharing. There’s no doubting the artfulness of Swift’s best status updates. Red’s center­piece is “All Too Well,” co-­written with songwriter Liz Rose, a frequent ­collaborator. If the Internet is to be believed, “All Too Well” is about Jake Gyllenhaal, whose romance with Swift convulsed the tabloids in late 2010. It’s a ballad that rises, like a slow-cresting wave, over a bass line similar to the one in U2’s “With or Without You.” There are the usual recriminations, which arrive in tight, crackling couplets: “You call me up again just to break me like a promise / So casually cruel in the name of being honest.” But “All Too Well” is also a montage of fond ­memories, vividly drawn: The song catches a couple “singing in the car, getting lost upstate” and dancing around the kitchen “in the refrigerator light.” Here is Swift, watching her boyfriend react as she pages through childhood photographs at his mother’s house: “Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red / You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed.” It takes a special songwriter to craft a sneering kiss-off that’s also tender valediction.\n\n“I heard from the guy that most of Red is about,” Swift said. “He was like, ‘I just listened to the album, and that was a really bittersweet experience for me. It was like going through a photo album.’ That was nice. Nicer than, like, the ranting, crazy e-mails I got from this one dude. It’s a lot more mature way of looking at a love that was wonderful until it was terrible, and both people got hurt from it—but one of those people happened to be a songwriter.”\n\nShe rolled her eyes. “So what are you going to do? Did you not Wikipedia me before you called me up?”\n\nThese days, Swift is thinking a lot about her next record. While on the Red tour, she’d been writing songs and stockpiling ideas: reams of lyrics, thousands of voice memos in her iPhone. Swift will end the year by performing in Australia and New Zealand and will play a few dates in London and Berlin in February. But she plans to spend much of 2014 writing and recording the new album, a prospect she finds exhilarating and terrifying.\n\n“I worry about everything,” Swift said. She was sitting in her dining room, at the head of a large antique wooden table. “Some days I wake up in a mind-set of, like, ‘Okay, it’s been a good run.’ By afternoon, I could have a change of mood and feel like anything is possible and I can’t wait to make this kind of music I’ve never made before. And then by evening, I could be terrified of the whole thing again. And then at night, I’ll write a song before bed.”\n\nSwift hopes to collaborate with new songwriters and producers. But she planned to begin, she said, by heading back into the studio with Max Martin and Shellback. “I want to go in with Max and Johan first, just to figure out what the bone structure of this record is going to be.\n\n“I have a lot of things to draw from emotionally at the moment. But I have to draw from them with a different perspective than on Red. I can’t say the same things over and over, you know? I mean, I think it’s just all the more important that I don’t ever allow myself to coast.\n\n“At the same time, there’s a mistake that I see artists make when they’re on their fourth or fifth record, and they think innovation is more important than solid songwriting. The most terrible letdown as a listener for me is when I’m listening to a song and I see what they were trying to do. Like, where there’s a dance break that doesn’t make any sense, there’s a rap that shouldn’t be there, there’s like a beat change that’s, like, the coolest, hippest thing this six months—but it has nothing to do with the feeling, it has nothing to do with the emotion, it has nothing to do with the lyric. I never want to put things in songs just because that might make them popular, like, on the more rhythmic stations or in dance clubs. I really don’t want a compilation of sounds. I just need them to be songs.”\n\nAs for the theme of those songs: That’s a foregone conclusion. “I only write songs about crazy love,” Swift said. “If I go on two dates with a guy and we don’t click, I’m not writing a song about that. It didn’t matter in the emotional grand scheme of things. There’s a lot that goes on in daily life that isn’t really worth turning into a verse and a chorus.”\n\nSwift is definitely in the right line of work: Popular song is, to a large degree, the art of setting crazy love to a tune. But Swift’s romanticism has brought disdain from certain quarters. In a post on the website ­Jezebel titled “Taylor Swift Is a Feminist’s Nightmare,” Dodai Stewart scorned the singer as retrograde, a prude infatuated with white-knight romance. “For Taylor, 15 means falling for a boy and dreaming of marrying him. My 15 was more like: Flirt with this one, make out with that one, try a cigarette, get drunk, lie to your parents, read some Anaïs Nin … [Swift’s] image of being good and pure plays right into how much the patriarchy fetishizes virginity, loves purity, and celebrates women who know their place as delicate flowers.”\n\nSwift is practically Victorian compared with stars like Beyoncé, Gaga, and Rihanna, to say nothing of another ­daughter of Nashville who’s been in the news lately, Miley Cyrus. Those women represent an aggressively sexualized feminist pop, harnessing big beats and skimpy outfits to work through questions of power and self-determination. Swift’s songs aren’t totally chaste: Sex is there in the rush and flush of the music, and it peeks through, discreetly, in the lyrics. But she is demure. Among other things, this is an excellent marketing strategy. Swift has moved from teen-pop stardom to adulthood, bringing her old fans along while staying wholesome enough for the next generation of tweens and their parents.\n\nStill, is Taylor Swift really a “feminist’s nightmare”? You could argue the ­opposite. Her straight-laced fashion sense and dance moves—the fact that she’s never writhed across a concert stage wearing a negligee, or less—may make her more square than some other singers. But she’s also less beholden to that old feminist bugbear, the Male Gaze.\n\nIn fact, seeing Swift live is revelatory: It’s in a setting like Bridgestone that her uniqueness, the weirdness of her conventionality—and, yes, her feminism—snaps into focus. I’ve been going to arena shows for three decades; I’ve never experienced a louder, more rabid crowd than at Swift’s concert. Nor, for that matter, a more female crowd, music critics from New York and creepy dudes from Oklahoma to the contrary. Even at a Justin Bieber show—even at a women’s-studies seminar—you won’t find as pronounced a female-to-male ratio, nor such a wide age range: toddlers and teens and tweens and their moms, for sure, but also college co-eds, and grandmothers, and rowdy thirtysomething office workers, like the gals who sat in the row behind me, passing a flask of booze. To push through the turnstiles of a Taylor Swift concert is to enter, as the saying goes, a women’s space. Swift has the power to turn a hockey arena into a room of one’s own.\n\nShe puts on a good show. In the past, Swift’s singing has been shaky—who can forget the wounded-water-buffalo ­harmonies in her duet with Stevie Nicks at the 2010 Grammys—but these days her pitch is sure; she sings confidently, ­prettily, if not quite muscularly. The ­concert is elaborately choreographed, and she hits her marks like a pro. But the most fascinating bits come between songs, when Swift speaks to the crowd. Her ­banter consists almost entirely of talk about songwriting. It is a rather eccentric brand of stage patter: more hippie arts-camp counselor than rock star.\n\n“I think for me, a question that I get asked sort of a lot is: How do you write a song? Like, where do you start? I just imagine that I am putting a message in a bottle and sending it out into the ocean.”\n\n“I remember being really young, and the thing I would write songs about, mostly, was the fact that I really didn’t really fit in in school. Songwriting became a coping mechanism for me early on.”\n\n“I think it was Joni Mitchell who said that, ‘Songs are what you think of on the drive home.’ You know, the Great Afterthought.”\n\nAt Bridgestone the loudest cheer of an earsplittingly loud night came when Swift was sitting at the piano, in the middle of a rambling introduction to “All Too Well.” “I’m sure,” she said, shooting a sidelong glance at the audience, “we have a lot of people here tonight who write songs.” Call Swift a stooge for the patriarchy if you like, but the message of her concerts is a different one: that great power is unleashed when a female takes a guitar and pen in hand and makes some art.\nAt her apartment, I ask Swift to explain her rapport with her fans.\n\n“There’s more of a friendship ­element to it than anything else,” she said. “Maybe it’s a big-sister relationship. Or it’s a Hey, we’re the same age—and we were both 16 when my first album came out, and we’ve both grown up together.\n\n“Audiences respond differently to ­different effects that artists have on them. I’ve noticed this, from bringing lots of special guests onstage. Crowds scream for lots of different reasons. There’s a certain cute-boy scream. And there’s, like, a ­certain ‘I identify with this lyric, this lyric is my life’ scream. I guess that’s the scream that I hear in my concerts.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Producer Nathan Chapman talks Taylor Swift, The Band Perry and songwriting\nBy Joe Bosso published 17 December 2013\n\"Winning the Grammy didn't take away my dreams. It gave me more goals to shoot for.\"\n\nWhen Nathan Chapman won the Album Of The Year Grammy Award in 2010 for co-producing Taylor Swift's multi-platinum disc Fearless, he viewed the accolade not only as an honor but also a sign that it was time to keep pushing.\n\n\"It was cool to have something like that happen early in my career,\" Chapman says. \"It let me see how high the bar is. But winning the Grammy didn't take away my dreams; it gave me more goals to shoot for. I was like, 'OK, I'd like to do that again someday.'\"\n\nThat may happen sooner than later: Chapman co-produced Swift's 2012 album, Red, which has just been nominated for both Best Country Album and Album Of The Year.\n\nThe 36-year-old Chapman began working with Swift in 2004, when he was a session guitarist playing on demos and the future star was a 14-year-old aspiring singer-songwriter. Beginning with Swift's self-titled 2006 debut, Chapman has co-produced all of artist's albums, creating a new paradigm for the sound of pop-country crossover (tight, bold guitars, fiddles and steel guitar, walloping beats and choruses that mean business) and racking up sales in the tens of millions. Along the way, he's become one of Nashville's most in-demand record makers, helming hits for The Band Perry, Shania Twain, Keith Urban, Lionel Richie and Point Of Grace, among others.\n\nChapman sat down with MusicRadar to talk about how he got his start, what he heard in Swift's demo tape, how he remade Endless Love with Lionel Richie and why Nashville is different from any other music town.\n\nYour parents [Steve and Annie Chapman] are performers. Did they encourage you to get into music?\n\n\"Yeah, I was around studios a lot with my dad. He wrote all the songs for him and my mom - they were a duo. I was exposed to the songwriting process and all of that. My mom and dad went independent in 1987, which was pretty unheard of then, paying for your own records and distributing them by themselves. Because they were doing that, my dad was doing pretty much everything. He'd put me in front of different musicians and say, 'I'm writing you a check today, so my kid's gonna watch you work.' [Laughs]\n\n\"I got to hang out with Jerry McPherson, whom I'm working with now, actually; Don Potter, an acoustic guitar player - he co-produced a lot of The Judds' records; and Gary Hedden, who's kind of an engineer's engineer. It was great being around everybody and watching them work.\"\n\nBy being a fly on the wall at such a young age, did that helped shape your production aesthetic?\n\n\"You know, a lot of kids nowadays have Logic and a laptop, and they're able to dive into the process of recording music and putting their ideas down. The early impressions that were made on me as a kid were more on the philosophical side, because I had no idea what all the knobs meant. Watching these records being made, the process seemed so unattainable; it was tape and consoles and plate reverbs and all that old-school stuff. As a kid, there was no way I'd be allowed to play with Don Potter's rig, you know? In my late teens, my parents bought me some studio gear, but like I said, my early impressions were more philosophical and creative.\"\n\n\n\n\"Some producers are like, 'Here's the song and here's the production,'\" Chapman says. \"With me, it's just 'Here's the song.'\"\n\nCan you elaborate on that? What did you come away with that you were able to apply to your own work?\n\n\"Well, when I was 12 years old, Don Potter looked at me and said, 'Don't ever have a song that doesn't have an instrumental hook. It should be different from the rest of the song, but it's gotta be memorable.' You're 12 years old and Don Potter tells you that, that sticks. I remember Gary Hedden was mixing a song, and there was a percussion track that was a little bit out of time. He said to me, 'You know what you do with something that's not grooving? You turn it up!' [Laughs] Little things like that.\n\n\"Watching my dad, too, seeing him make records - it all rubbed off on me. The guys were all open and honest with me. I was the artist's kid, so they'd tell me all their tricks and stuff.\"\n\nDid you have a plan B, or were you always set on working in music?\n\n\"I'd say there was no plan B. Growing up around music, it was just everywhere. I was inundated with it, and I loved it. There was no way around it for me, and I'm grateful for that.\"\n\nWho were your early guitar heroes? Who did you want to emulate?\n\n\"I had three or four guitar heroes: Phil Keaggy, David Gilmour, and Dana Key from the Christian band DeGarmo and Key. Dana was a Memphis guy, blues based - he passed away a few years ago. I was way into blues players. David Gilmour's a blues player, and so was Stevie Ray Vaughan. Phil Keaggy can be more avant-garde, super-smart rock 'n' roll. Those were my main guitar heroes growing up.\"\n\nDid you start out doing sessions as a guitarist before you got into production?\n\n\"I worked a lot in studios as a kid, but I got away from it when I went to college - I kind of needed a break. When I came back, I figured out that I could do demos really well for songwriters. My wife is a songwriter, and she was writing at the same company where Liz Rose was writing - Liz and Taylor wrote a lot of the early hits together. I became something of a demo guy for a lot of songwriters. When Taylor and I started working together, she was just 14, and she was just another songwriter in my world of doing demos.\"\n\n\n\n\"She's a great storyteller,\" Chapman says of Swift. \"All of the iconic artists in Nashville tell the best stories.\" © Devin Simmons/AdMedia/Corbis\n\nWhat stuck out to you about her, though? She was very young, but obviously something seemed different about her.\n\n\"I thought her songwriting was brilliant, and I was around the best writers I could be at that time as a producer. I was around Liz Rose, my wife Stephanie Chapman, Lori McKenna, Brandy Clark. The group of songwriters I was doing demos for was just incredible.\n\n\"Taylor was already amazing. One of her big hits off the first album is called Our Song, which she wrote by herself. If you break down that chorus lyric - 'Our song is a slamming screen door, sneakin' out late, tapping on your window' - it's, like, all of these sounds of the relationship are the song. That's super-smart, brilliant stuff. As a young producer wanting to work on the best songs I could get my hands on, I was like, 'I got it.' That was the first thing that hit me about Taylor, the songwriting.\"\n\nBeing that you're a guitar player, when it came time to produce Taylor, what did you envision for the actual guitar sound on the records?\n\n\"A lot of times producers tend to take what a songwriter wrote and make it different because they think it needs to be different. Some producers are like, 'Here's the song and here's the production.' With me, it's just 'Here's the song.' I wanted the production to disappear into her vision of what the song should be.\n\n\"I just thought Taylor's songs needed to be bigger. The idea was to keep the heart and soul of the songs, make them bigger - adding drums and bass and overdubs, percussion and harmonies - but not make them different. I think the sound of those first two or three records we did together is the heart and soul of what she wrote, and it's the bigger version of what she sang to me, just her and her guitar. It's what I heard in my head, but I tried to not make it different from what she felt like when she was writing.\"\n\nNow, you've undoubtedly taught Taylor a thing or two during your time together, but I'm curious - what has she taught you?\n\n\"How to write a song, pretty much. But one of the biggest things was something pretty interesting: When we made Speak Now, there were several five- and six-minute songs on the project. At one point, that felt like a tall order, because you don't want the listeners to feel like they're listening to a long song. But when I saw her at rehearsal, and I saw how she built the show with these songs, I was like, 'Ohhh, I get it now.' She had this show in her head when she wrote the songs; she had a vision.\"\n\n\n\n\"We really took our time and made a pretty special record,\" Chapman says of working with The Band Perry (from left: Neil Perry, Kimberly Perry and Reid Perry). © Laura Farr/AdMedia/AdMedia/Corbis\n\nYou co-produced The Band Perry's first album. How did you hook up with them?\n\n\"Through [Big Machine Records CEO] Scott Borchetta - they're on the same label as Taylor. They needed somebody to cut five songs on the record. I had a blast in the studio with them. Chuck Ainlay engineered it, and he did an awesome job.\"\n\nDid you have a particular agenda when you went into the studio with them? Anything you wanted to do or not do with them?\n\n\"I wanted the guys in the band, Neil and Reid, to play on the tracks in the studio. That was a little out of the ordinary, because sometimes bands don't play on their records. But I definitely wanted them to be on the tracking dates. It's way cooler like that than if it were only a bunch of studio guys. And the studio guys are great; sometimes they're so good, you feel as though they are the band as opposed to studio players. I had a great time with them. We really took our time and made a pretty special record.\"\n\nSometimes band members get intimidated and uncomfortable with session guys on their dates. How did you help to create a good environment for everybody?\n\n\"The studio guys I had - Shannon Forrest on drums and Brian Sutton, who played acoustic guitar - they're really cool guys who don't give off a superior vibe. Brian, especially, is one of the who's who of acoustic guitars. So with the guys in the band, it's kind of like they got to play with their heroes - they were more excited than nervous. Rather than being intimidated, I think they were inspired.\n\n\"The vibe in Nashville is different from other places. You might intimidate somebody by accident, but you wouldn't do it on purpose. People don't carry themselves in that way. If you were the kind of person who tried to make others feel 'less than,' you probably wouldn't get called that much. It's a real family town.\"\n\nHow did you come to work with Shania Twain? In 2011, the first new music she made in six years was with you.\n\n\"What happened was, I got a call from [producer] Tony Brown, who was working with Lionel Richie. Lionel wanted to do some tracks that were programmed, where you built it from fake drums up, and then you go in and cut it with the band. Tony is a very generous and dear soul, and a really great guy, and he told Lionel, 'If you have a few songs you want done that way, why not hand them over to Nathan? He works like that.'\n\n\"Lionel and I had dinner, and he told me that he wanted me to work on a version of Endless Love that he wanted to do with Shania Twain. He said, 'Build a track and let me see what you would do on a 2012 version of the song.' I gave it a shot, and a lot of what you hear on the Tuskegee record for that song is what I built at the house. Then Lionel sent that track with his vocal to Shania. She loved it and said, 'Great, let's cut the vocals.' We got together and cut her vocal, and after that she said, 'Hey, I've got this other song. I want you to work on it for my TV show.' And onward we went, doing the song Today Is Your Day.\"\n\n\nActually, I wanted to ask you about Endless Love. What were your ideas for updating it musically? That can sometimes be a tricky thing - you don't want to take it too far so people don't recognize it, but you don't want to Xerox the original, either.\n\n\"Yeah, that's true. What happened was, I had bought a ukulele for a Colbie Caillat song I worked on. For some reason, I couldn't put it down, and when I started thinking about what to do with Endless Love I started playing it ukulele. It was kind of an 'aha moment\" where I was like, 'Oh, hey, this would be pretty cool.' That's where the arrangement came from, walking around the house playing it on ukulele.\n\n\"When Lionel came over, I looked at him and said, 'I've got one word for you, Lionel: ukulele.' He gave me the funniest look, but when I hit play on the pre-production he was like, 'Yes. This is awesome!' That's the same ukulele I play on Keith Urban's single Little Bit Of Everything. It's a Collings Koa wood - sounds incredible.\"\n\nWhat's your favorite studio in Nashville?\n\n\"Blackbird. Blackbird D is my favorite tracking room, and E and H are my favorite overdub rooms. Fabulous studio. Trying to say everything that's good about the place would take forever. The rooms are very versatile - you can make the A and the D rooms gigantic or very small and '70s dry. And the gear, with [studio owner] John McBride, you have every type of compressor, preamp, mic or tape machine ever made. There's no limitations for the kinds of equipment you might want.\n\n\"The assistants - everybody from the runners to the assistant engineers - are all top notch. It's a dream gig to work there, so they're able to hire the best. They know everything about having a studio. Plus, John and Martina McBride are just the sweetest people. They're the kinds of people you want to be friends with. It's a great hang and a terrific work experience. The first time you work there, you go, 'Oh, there are other studios? I forgot.'\" [Laughs]\n\nDo you want to stay pretty much in the country genre? Would you want to produce any straight-up rock bands - or metal bands even?\n\n\"Well, I have been doing some tracks with O.A.R. They've had a bunch of hits, so it's cool working with them. I did the Keith Urban singles that were out earlier this year and the Lady Antebellum single. I like staying in Nashville and working here. If I did a heavy metal record, it would be a disaster. Banjo and steel guitar would end up on it somewhere.\" [Laughs]\n\nNashville is the hottest music town on the planet. Why do you think it's special - or different - from other major cities right now?\n\n\"I grew up here, so I'm probably biased. [Laughs] For me, I like to make music with the story first, and that's the big thing about Nashville: It's a story town. I look at it the same way as if you were making a movie. If you have a great story, you're starting off with a tremendous advantage. Nashville celebrates storytelling.\n\n\"That might be why some artists who come here struggle to have a hit in the country market. It looks easy from the outside, but it's not. All of the iconic artists in Nashville tell the best stories. Willie Nelson, Reba McIntire, Dolly Parton - so many others I could name - they all have that in common. That's one of the reasons why Taylor has done so well and why she calls Nashville home: She's a great storyteller.\"\n\n",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift energetically paced the room of her West Hollywood hotel on a recent visit to Los Angeles.\n\n“I’m trying to outrun the jet lag,” she said with a smile, looking far from ragged in her matching purple sweater and skirt. Before landing in L.A., she’d flown from Australia to London, then on to Nashville on her way back from the latest leg of her “Red” tour.\n\nBut Swift, 24, is nothing if not game to be front and center for every facet of her career, so she committed to the schlep to L.A. for a Directors Guild of America screening of “One Chance,” the film that’s earned her a second Golden Globe Award nomination for her original song, “Sweeter Than Fiction.”\n\nPHOTOS: Taylor Swift is never ever getting back together with ...\n\nThe Weinstein Co. movie, on which “American Idol”/”X Factor” kingpin Simon Cowell is a producer, is the lightly fictionalized story of singer Paul Potts, the British cellphone salesman who became a worldwide sensation through his 2007 appearance on the first season of Cowell’s U.K. reality competition, “Britain’s Got Talent.” He ultimately won singing opera, even though the round-faced bloke with the chipped-tooth grin hardly fit the stereotypical image of the strapping, heroic operatic tenor.\n\nThe video clip of his first appearance on “Britain’s Got Talent” has generated nearly 120 million views on YouTube, and after winning the show he took home the grand prize of about $250,000 and delivered a command performance for Queen Elizabeth II. He’s subsequently released four albums that have sold millions of copies worldwide after overcoming a crushing lack of self-confidence and a string of monumental mishaps.\n\n“When you’re watching the movie, at times you sit there and you can’t believe it really happened,” Swift said. “It’s a true story that seems like a fairy tale — and I loved that. If you watch a fairy tale, there’s an element of fiction to it, but pairing it with the truth — a real-life story with this fairy tale feeling — was something I found to be unique and really beautiful.”\n\nSwift said she hadn’t known much more about Potts beyond the popular YouTube clip of his first audition singing Puccini’s “Nessun Dorma” aria.\n\n“I’d seen the viral video, so many people had seen that and were moved by that,” she said. “But I never had any idea how much of the story we never saw.”\n\nPHOTOS: Miley Cyrus before and after Disney\n\nThe film has played in the U.S. mostly in film festivals and limited engagement screenings, and is set for a broader release later this month.\n\nIt traces Potts’ passion for opera since boyhood, an unconventional fixation that made him a social outcast, then follows him through his experience traveling to Venice to study opera at a school where Luciano Pavarotti served on the board of directors.\n\nPotts eventually sings for the master, but the result is far from what he’d hoped for. Returning to his job managing a shop called Car Phone Warehouse, Potts suffers one setback after another until he stumbles across the notice for the new talent competition. The notoriously crusty Cowell is one of three judges, yet Potts manages to melt Cowell’s heart with his initial performance.\n\n“There were a lot of different, obvious ways to go with the concept of the song,” Swift said of “Sweeter Than Fiction.”\n\n“One of them,” she said, adopting an artificially callow voice, “was ‘I want to achieve my dreams and I’m not going to stop till I do.’ ”\n\nPHOTOS: Katy Perry’s offbeat concert costumes\n\nInstead, she wrote “Sweeter Than Fiction” from the perspective of Potts’ girlfriend, Jules, whom he marries well before entering the “Britain’s Got Talent” contest. Her unflagging support of her husband’s dream through thick, and mostly thin, is what got Swift’s attention.\n\n“This woman stood by him and worked at this pharmacy and supported him while he was at one point unemployed … with this crazy dream that he wanted to be an opera singer,” she said. “And no matter what, she never told him to stop. She unselfishly supported him throughout the good and the bad. I just found it to be beautiful. It’s this amazing story of love after the butterflies are gone, when it really has to be love and support. That’s why I chose that story line.”\n\nSwift collaborated with Jack Antonoff of the band fun. on the movie’s end-credits song, which has something of an ‘80s Brit-pop feel.\n\n“I really wanted to work with Jack Antonoff on the song because he does an amazing job of walking this line between very current-sounding music and shades of nostalgic-sounding music,” she said. “You’re transported a little bit back to late ‘80s and early ‘90s, which a lot of the story takes place. That’s what we were going for.”\n\nPHOTOS: Daughters of rock stars\n\nSwift said she also connected with the theme of Potts’ perseverance, despite others — his father included — suggesting he abandon his dream and settle into a more realistic career.\n\n“I really connected with so many different things about the movie,” Swift said. “There’s this line in the movie where she always reassures him and says ‘One foot, then the other.’ That’s been the way I’ve always approached my career.\n\n“I’ve never had crazy, crazy goals,” she said. “I’ve never put down a list of things I want to achieve by a certain time. It’s been lots of ‘one foot, then the other.’ It’s stepping stones: Once you get one foot firmly on this stone, then you put your foot on the next one.\n\n“I think that’s been sort of the joy of things like getting a Golden Globe nomination on my birthday,” she said, noting that the Golden Globe nominations announcement came down Dec. 13, the day she turned 24 and just a week after she learned she was nominated for four Grammy awards connected to her “Red” album, including album of the year. “When you don’t see them coming, those surprises are that much sweeter.”\n\nrandy.lewis@latimes.com",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift talks favorite Christmas songs, next album\nBy James Hibberd  Published on December 23, 2013 07:24PM EST\n\nYou hear music as you enter the Sunset Marquis hotel on a chilly December afternoon.\n\nYou briefly think it’s a recording, but quickly realize that isn’t right. The music is too present and singular. You round the corner into an expansive suite and see Taylor Swift, playing a piano, with a roaring fire in the background. It’s like a scene from a holiday card sent by the seven-time Grammy winner rather than an actual room you can enter. You want this moment to go longer — a private show! — but she immediately bounds to her feet, full of bright energy, and says a warm hello.\n\nSome celebrities in person look like what you expect and others appear quite different; Swift looks like herself. Her outfit is purple-ish, with a long modest skirt. She glances around for a place to sit and this is a brief dilemma. She decides to ignore all the furniture and instead sits on the floor by the fireplace, asking you: Is that okay? So you both sit cross-legged by the fire. It’s all very congenial and Christmas-y, which is appropriate since you have some holiday music questions on your list. There is just one awkward moment that cracks the mood — you forwardly ask a Miley Cyrus question (can’t blame a reporter for trying, right?). Swift scrunches her nose, like she just caught a whiff of a unsavory question, and politely asks to skip that one (“we have so little time,” she says).\n\nWe’re here to talk about Swift’s new song “Sweeter Than Fiction,” which is accompanying the release of the heartwarming British comedy One Chance (trailer here). The film is based on the true story of an amateur opera singer who won Britain’s Got Talent. She also just received a Golden Globe nomination for the track. But we manage to get in some other questions too.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: So you wouldn’t really expect an original song of yours on a modest British indie comedy, how did this come about?\nTaylor Swift: I fell in love with the film after I got to see it. I was lucky to be one of the first people to see it. I think [producer Harvey Weinstein] knew what he was doing. He contacted us and said, “I think I have a film Taylor should see.” I don’t think he needed to say a word; he knew I’d go and write an end-credits song. So for me there were so many different amazing themes about the movie to draw from. My experience with songwriting is usually so confessional, it’s so drawn from my own life and my own stories. There’s something so unique about that and I get a special buzz from that. But it’s also kind of cool to focus on somebody else’s storylines.\n\nYou get to step outside yourself for the song.\nGive yourself a little bit of a break from the introspection.\n\nHow was it collaborating with Jack Antonoff? Any chance of that happening again?\nThere’s a huge chance of that happening again. This is the first time that Jack Antonoff and I had collaborated. We had been friends for awhile, because I’m really good friends with [Antonoff's girlfriend Lena Dunham] and the three of us are always hanging out. And one time we were together, we were going over tracks and stuff, and there was a lightning bolt that went off between both of us that we should work together. So he was the first person I contacted. Jack is so good at mixing ’80s nostalgia into his music and I wanted that to be reflected in this song because I wanted something so different from the opera that is at the forefront of the movie. And also a great deal of the plot line of the movie takes place in the ’80s and ’90s.\n\nAnd there was the Golden Globe nomination. Do you still get a surge of emotion when nominations happen?\nI got a text from Lena as soon as it happened and she’s like, “Holy Golden Globe nomination!” And I texted back: “Don’t lie, that’s not funny.” And I called her up and I was screaming. And she was screaming. And then Jack woke up and he was screaming. It happened on my birthday so it was the most unbelievable occurrence.\n\nIs there another artist that you’ve always wanted to work with?\nI’m kinda obsessed with Sia. Always have been.\n\nWhat have you not accomplished career-wise that you really want to do?\nOh so much! How much time do you have?\n\nWell, what’s a couple of the biggest things you want to accomplish?\nOne thing I’ve tried to never do is make wish lists. I try to have a very steppingstone mentality about this whole thing, where as soon as you make one step you visualize the next step, not five steps ahead. There’s a line in the movie that’s almost word-for-word that metaphor. That’s the way I’ve always looked at my career. I would love to win another Grammy. I would love to get to go the Oscars someday. That’s why I’m so happy to get to be a part of movies.\n\nSpeaking of next steps, you recently said your next album is ahead of schedule. Roughly when should that be expected?\nThey would be so mad at me if I told you what I have in my head as far as the plan goes, and I hate to say a plan and then change it. A great deal of what will happen this year has to do with what will happen this next month. But for me writing the next record, it usually takes me awhile to find the new sound. It usually takes me a year to shed the last album’s sound and start anew. And this one just started on new territory.\n\nYou keep segueing perfectly to the next question on my list–\nYes!\n\nWhich is: You’ve said you have a new sound for this album. How would you describe that?\nHmm. Describing it is difficult. At the core of what I do, it’s always going to revolve around a confessional storyline and filling my fans in on what my life has actually been. It’s become this lifeline between me and my friends and they know that no matter what they read in some magazine, they’re going to hear the actual accounting of it when the album comes out. I’ve always written songs for the same reason — to sort through my emotions. As I grow up, the lessons I learn in love and relationships and how we treat each other are hopefully maturing — hopefully.\n\nWe also have some questions for our Christmas survey. The first song you want to listen to when you start playing Christmas music each year?\nSo many! Colbie Caillat has a great Christmas album I’m obsessed with. I love the She & Him Christmas stuff. Bing Crosby, of course. “All I Want for Christmas Is You” by Mariah Carey. Beach Boys have great Christmas music. Train has this song called “Shake Up Christmas.” I have so many favorite Christmas songs right now.\n\nWhat’s the hidden-gem Christmas song you wish more people knew about?\nHuh … Can I get out my phone?\n\nAbsolutely. That’s not cheating.\nOkay. I’m on it! … There’s one called “It’s Christmas Time” by Jules Larson, that I find to be just delightful. Oh, and Fountains of Wayne has a song called “Valley Winter Song.” I’m obsessed with it and I’ve turned it in my mind into a Christmas song.\n\nAnd what is the one Christmas song that you cannot stand?\nI don’t have one really. I only download the ones I like.",

      "Transcript/Content": "On an obvious, commercial level, it makes perfect sense for Taylor Swift to record end-credits for teen-targeted films. In 2012 she teamed up with T Bone Burnett and the Civil Wars for “The Hunger Games’” signature tune “Safe and Sound.” It helped lift the pic’s soundtrack to No. 10 on the Billboard chart, nabbing a Golden Globe nomination and a Grammy in the process.\n\nLate last year she partnered with Fun guitarist Jack Antonoff to pen and perform “Sweeter Than Fiction” from the Weinstein Co.’s “One Chance,” for which she’ll once again be competing for best original song at the Golden Globes.\n\nYet on a less obvious, artistic level, it doesn’t make much sense at all. Writing for characters, and fitting her style into the tenor of an existing film, isn’t consistent with Swift’s m.o., which favors an inward-looking songwriting process that tends to attract such adjectives as confessional, intimate, purgative ….\n\n“Also ‘diaristic,’” Swift interjects. “That’s a popular one.”\n\nDiaristic though she may be, Swift does not actually write from a diary.\n\nThe closest she comes is the array of notes on her cell phone, filled with “phrases I thought of that would be better if you twisted it around in some way, phrases that rhyme really well with this other phrase that you could twist to make a sort of off-rhyme … I’m always making notes.” So marrying these stray observations with a more distanced perspective is hardly incompatible with her method.\n\n“It’s almost a relief to turn the microscope around and not have to be so introspective, and draw directly from your life,” she says. “When I see a story play out and see all the different themes, one of them will always jump out at me. Like, with ‘Hunger Games’ there were so many different themes to draw from, and the one we drew from was ‘empathy.’”\n\nFor “One Chance,” inspired by the story of Paul Potts, a warehouse manager and amateur opera singer who won the first season of “Britain’s Got Talent,” Swift drew upon the outsider perspective that, for all her popularity, has long been a constant theme of her music.\n\n“He’s a struggling opera singer, and no one gets it,” she says. “Which I related to a little bit growing up (in Pennsylvania) being so obsessed with country music — in my school, everyone was a little bit perplexed.”\n\nThough it often gets lost in the swirl of celebrity and stagecraft that surrounds her, Swift has always been a songwriter first and foremost — she was, after all, the youngest tunesmith ever signed by Sony/ATV publishing. But adapting the wide-eyed yet subtly cynical teenage songwriting perspective on which she staked her early fame into a more mature, adult outlook is still a work in progress, and one that Swift seems to approach in an analytical way.\n\n“Jody Rosen did a profile of me recently where he called (my songwriting) both purple and precise; a mixture of some very purple lines and some very precise details. I thought that was very astute,” she says. “I know I obsess over the different facets that people have to their personalities if you pick them apart. I’m obsessed by the idea that in real life there’s no such thing as a bad guy or a good guy. So thinking in character or writing from the perspective of a character, it’s really like picking one version of who I am.\n\n“When I’m writing my own stuff, it’s about picking the specific corner that I want to view the world from. But for a character, it’s lucky when you have a really good performance. (Watching ‘One Chance’) I could see a song playing out as I saw the facial expressions, it was easy.”\n\nThis year will also see Swift take an onscreen role in another Weinstein production, Phillip Noyce’s adaptation of dystopian young adult novel “The Giver,” in which she plays the doomed “receiver” Rosemary. Yet these forays into film will likely be but footnotes to the yet-untitled and unscheduled fifth album she’s just beginning to sketch out.\n\nWhile Swift composed the whole of her third album, “Speak Now,” alone, her latest, “Red,” saw some of its biggest successes arise from her songwriting partnerships with the likes of Ed Sheeran, Gary Lightbody, Dan Wilson and, most lucratively, Max Martin and Shellback. Her fifth will again see her work with the latter two, and the value of collaboration comes up several times in conversation with the singer.\n\n“My favorite people to work with are the bluntest,” Swift says, “the ones who will say no. It’s important to have someone say, ‘That’s not good enough, go write a better pre-chorus,’ so I can go back to the drawing board. I don’t want people thinking if they’re too hard they won’t get to write with me again, when in fact it’s the contrary.”\n\nMartin is perhaps the most commercially consistent hitmaker of the past few decades, and in Swift’s renewed partnership with him, it’s possible to infer the kinds of pressures the 24-year-old must be under to churn out another smash LP on par with her previous four. To date, even Swift’s lowest-selling album has been certified quadruple platinum, and her current 79-date world tour has already grossed $115 million.\n\n“I have lot of goals, and one of them is to know when to stop,” she says. “I love the sound of applause but I don’t want to become addicted to it in order to feel whole. It’s the creative part of music-making that I could never live without.\n\n“Hopefully in your life you make graceful decisions, dignified career choices. There are lots of different directions to go in, and I’m not anywhere close to being out of ideas here. But as I grow older, I hope I can continue to rely on gut feelings and continue to be self-aware. Self-awareness is usually the first thing to go when people lose touch. So ideally I can keep my wits about me.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift's resolution: Conquering her 'supreme tidal wave of fear'\n\nBy Jay Bobbin    January 7, 2014 4:00 PM ET\n\nTaylor Swift received birthday gifts during the holiday season, but she also gave quite a hefty one.\n\nNominated for four Grammys at the 56th annual awards -- which CBS televises Sunday, Jan. 26 -- the singing-songwriting superstar marked turning 24 last month by donating $100,000 to the Nashville Symphony.\n\nThe musicians had taken a 15-percent salary cut in their contract negotiation last summer, and Swift elected to do her part, which earned her DoSomething.org's title of most charitable celebrity of 2013.\n\n\"They're an incredible group of people,\" she tells Zap2It. \"I played with them a couple of years ago, and I had no idea they had gotten so wiped out by the floods in Nashville. There was so much damage to their building, they had to cut back on costs. They would never ask me to give anything, and that's why I felt compelled to do so.\"\n\nNow with Grammy bids for the multiple-hit-yielding \"Red\" that include Album of the Year and Country Album -- both of which she won in 2010 (for \"Fearless\") -- Swift will take her current concert tour to Europe days after the award ceremony. She intends to give those fans the whole show, entailing some big shipping costs.\n\n\"I'm so excited for London and Berlin,\" she says, \"and I'm really excited that we've taken the time to ship everything over. We'll have the full show, and that's why we've taken a break between going to Australia and going to London. I don't want anybody to get a stripped-down version of the show, just me standing on a stage.\"\n\nAs Swift starts work on her fifth album, she's also a nominee in Sunday's (Jan. 12) 70th Annual Golden Globe Awards for \"Sweeter Than Fiction,\" the song she wrote with Jack Antonoff of fun. for the movie \"One Chance.\" Her recent North American and Australian touring has made her all the more committed to deliver for her followers, who have boosted \"Red\" to quadruple-platinum sales.\n\n\"My fans have really been showing up and going above and beyond,\" Swift says. \"With all these amazing things happening, one thing I've worked on for the last couple of years is that when they're happening, not having a supreme tidal wave of fear follow the great things.\"\n\nShe continues, \"I try really hard just to experience the joy and celebrate it, rather than fearing when it will all end, or fearing that I'll say something stupid and everyone will hate me. That's the struggle, processing things the right way ... and lately, I've really been able to live in the moment and appreciate what's happening to me. Which is amazing.\"",

That has taken up most of his time, he said, so he hasn’t been paying attention to the recent controversy surrounding his girlfriend’s show, “Girls.” (At the Television Critics Assn. press tour last week, a critic asked Dunham why she was naked so much on the show, which didn’t go over well with her.)\n\n“I try to stay out of it,” Antonoff said. “There’s no one stronger than Lena.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Talks Social Media, Style, and Her Latest Collection for Keds\nBring on spring with some sweet shoes and advice straight from the star herself.\nby Victoria Lewis\n\nPhoto courtesy of Keds\nIt's no secret that Taylor Swift loves a good pair of classic kicks. The songstress recently debuted her fourth collection for Keds. It's filled with fun patterns in look-at-me hues, and we can't get enough—so we went straight to the source to learn all about her brand-new line.\n\n\"When I was a little kid, I had a pair of white Keds I wore everywhere,\" Taylor told us. \"It was a nostalgic feeling when they asked me to be the inspiration for the collection. It's cool to be part of something with such a legacy.\" Her latest designs are inspired by her own wardrobe, which Taylor playfully describes as a combination of Easter egg colored and nautical-inspired pieces. \"There's a lot of lace, polka dots, and stripes because those are the things I wear all the time!\"\n\nThe other thing Taylor wears all the time? Her signature sneaks, of course. \"I wore them on the Red tour during a part of the show where I had to crowd surf into a group of dancers, jump off the stage, and run all the way across the arena,\" she reveals. \"They were perfect!\" She's also been known to sport a pair to the gym or even to the beach. \"For me, it's a comfort thing,\" she says.\n\nWhile her Keds have remained constant, Taylor's look has evolved over the years from cowboy boot-wearing teen to 1960s-inspired glamour girl. \"I don't usually follow trends,\" she explains. \"I try to wear things that I can look back on in 30 years and be happy about!\"\n\nWhich isn't to say she hasn't had her fair share of wardrobe regrets. \"I never got to go to prom,\" she shares. \"So when I was younger, I wore prom dresses on the red carpet or to awards shows.\" Sound like a sacrifice you'd be willing to make for superstardom? Taylor's got some advice for you: \"It's less important to study the way other people make it in this industry,\" she says. \"If someone showed up at my record label and said and did the exact things I did, it probably wouldn't work.\" Her solution? Strength in numbers. \"If you can get a fan base behind you, they're far more likely to listen.\"\n\nAnd even though she's amassed over 30 million Twitter followers, Taylor admits she prefers her social media presence to be like her style: simple. \"I'm the only person with my password,\" she says. \"I'll tweet maybe once every two weeks. I don't want to seem like I always have my phone out looking for the next thing to upload. One of the most important things about social media is knowing when to put the phone down and experience your life,\" she says. \"If I were to tweet what I'm doing every minute, all you'd get would be pictures of me watching TV with my cat and you'd be depressed for me!\" Somehow, we doubt it.\n\nWant to take a peek at Taylor's sweet sense of style? Check out the Instagram below, which is sure to put you in a warm weather-ready mood.

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift REALLY Wants Ed Sheeran to Win a GRAMMY\nIt's a crowded field for Best New Artist at this year's Grammys. But Taylor Swift had no trouble making up her mind who she wants to win.\n\nBy Chris Payne 01/24/2014\n\nIt’s a crowded field for Best New Artist at this year’s GRAMMYs. Ed Sheeran, James Blake, Kacey Musgraves, Kendrick Lamar, and Macklemore & Ryan Lewis all bring convincing arguments to the table, from very different corners of the music world, no less. But Taylor Swift had no trouble making up her mind. For her, it’s all about touring comrade/collaborator Sheeran, and Billboard caught up with Swift to get the details.In live settings, Sheeran’s uncanny charm brings whole arenas to silence, allowing him to perform his heartfelt acoustic songs without a backing band. Swift thinks that onstage persona could lend itself to the GRAMMY podium as well.\n\n“I think he would have amazing acceptance speeches. We toured together all year and I watched him every single night. He was just such a show-stopper.”\n\nSheeran is prepping for the release of his highly-anticipated sophomore effort, due some time in 2014. He worked with the legendary Rick Rubin on the new music and says he hopes to release three albums over the next three years. \n\n“It was so amazing to watch him work and to watch him put together his new record, which is going to be great,” Swift says. “Whether or not he wins Best New Artist, I think people are going to be so blown away by what comes next from him.”\n\nSpeaking of new albums, Swift herself is due to release a new studio full length next year, rumored for the fourth quarter of 2014. “I’m really loving collaboration right now,” she told Billboard in December. “I see it as a bit of an apprenticeship. I want to be around people who love writing songs and have done it for years.”\n\nSwift has already hinted that Max Martin is among those collaborators. \n\nIn the meantime, Swift is set to perform at this year’s GRAMMYs and is nominated for four awards: Album of the Year and Best Country Album for “Red,” Best Country Duo/Group Performance for “Highway Don’t Care” (alongside Tim McGraw and Keith Urban), and Best Country Song for “Begin Again.” ",

      "Transcript/Content": "The Karaoke King and I\nBy Louise Gannon\n\nPUBLISHED: 13:00 EST, 1 February 2014 | UPDATED: 19:34 EST, 1 February 2014\n\nAs Taylor Swift arrives in the UK for the European leg of her RED Tour she reveals for the first time what really happened when William dragged her on stage at Kensington Palace...\n\nTaylor Swift is trying to think how to sum up the vocal talents of one of the most high profile men she’s ever shared a microphone with – the Karaoke Kid aka HRH Prince William.\n\nShe lets out a couple of slightly supressed, rather ladylike squeals as she works out loud exactly what to say.\n\n'I mean, he is a member of the royal family, this was a private event and I wouldn’t ever want to say anything remotely disrespectful because I absolutely adore William and Kate,' she says.\n\nI tell her not to worry, that beheading is a thing of the past in the British royal family and she laughs out loud.\n\nThe clip of them – alongside Jon Bon Jovi – singing Livin’ On A Prayer went viral on You Tube a few months ago. She herself has kept a DVD copy.\n\n'Well both of us were more screaming than singing,' she says.\n\n'But even through all that I could hear his voice and it is pretty good. A nice tone. I’d definitely say he’s got star quality and if he ever wants me to sing with him again I’ll be there.'\n\nAt 24, with seven Grammy awards, record sales counted in billions as opposed to millions, a personal fortune of £62 million and all five dates of her current UK tour (which kicks off at The London O2 today) selling out within hours of going on sale, William is just part of a long line of stage partners from Justin Beiber to J-Lo, Stevie Nicks, Ed Sheeran, Carly Simon, Nicki Minaj and the Seventies American singer/songwriter she was named after, James Taylor.\n\nBut for a girl who – in a sea of Mileys, Gagas and Rihannas – uses words like 'decorum', absolutely believes in respecting your elders, has turned down millions to pose for Playboy ('There are a lot of offers that just don’t make sense to me') and whose dress code limits are hot pants; that infamous Centrepoint charity event at Kensington Palace alongside Jon Bon Jovi and a flushed and delighted looking Prince William was, she said: 'A night I will remember till I’m very, very old.'\n\nShe says: 'The whole evening was completely wondrous and felt so special from the start.\n\n'The theme was ‘winter white’ so I wore a long, white ball gown. Just walking through those beautifully ornate rooms and corridors in Kensington Palace with string quartets playing and that sense of all those people in history who’d walked through the same rooms was completely magical.\n\n'I had no idea I’d even meet Prince William. At the reception I saw Jon Bon Jovi talking to him and then he came over, smiled and started talking to me. I’d never met him before, he was so charming, so easy to talk to.\n\n'I know about curtseying in front of the royal family but I didn’t actually do it because it was much more informal.\n\n'Plus I was completely taken aback by his first words to me, he said: ‘I hear you’re heading off to Australia’ and I couldn’t believe this Prince of England actually knew what someone like me was up to.\n\n'Kate wasn’t with him but he actually sat next to me for the concert.\n\n'We were in the front row and there were singers like James Blunt, Tinie Tempah and Eliza Doolittle sitting near us.\n\n'Jon Bon Jovi got up to perform and he called him out because he’d heard William loves singing Livin’ On A Prayer on karaoke nights. Then he said to everyone in the room: \"If I put pressure on the Karaoke Kid he’ll have to get up and sing.\"\n\n'Prince William looked and me and said: ‘I’ll do it if you do it too’ and then took my hand. I was just completely surprised and flattered and it felt surreal and completely natural at the same time.\n\n'We jumped on the stage and started to sing and then we were really yelling into the microphone and clapping hands. I still can’t believe I’ve sung with the Prince of England.\n\n'But I completely love him – and Kate – I wished I got to meet her too because those guys are like this perfect, perfect couple. Looking at them just makes me feel happy.'\n\nYou’d think a girl like Taylor would be pretty happy all the time because she’s got everything she wanted. The last time I met her she was 19 and just on the cusp of becoming huge.\n\nNow she is mega-huge, up there with Beyonce, Katy Perry, Rihanna and Adele and with homes in Nashville, Rhode Island and Hollywood, who at this years Grammies stunned everyone by head-banging her way through the ballad ‘All Too Well’.\n\n'God, so much has happened to me in the past few years,' she says. 'It’s true that years in the celebrity world are like dog years and in that sense I feel about 45. It has got crazy but I like to think I’m pretty much the same person I was back then.'\n\nShe has not - unlike her peers Miley Cyrus, Justin Beiber and Rihanna – gone wild in an attempt to twerk her way into the credible sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll hall of fame.\n\n'I think I’ve kept to the same goals I’ve always had,' she says. 'I don’t compare myself to anyone else, I don’t make comments about anyone else because they do what feels right for them and that’s okay by me.\n\n'You get to a point where it’s like you can’t really do anything right and people will pick on you for whatever decisions you make, so I just try and take no notice and get on with my music.'\n\nWhat’s the wildest, most hedonistic thing she has ever done? She laughs: 'That is a tough one, I think I’ll have to ask my friends.'\n\nShe has never, she says, done anything illegal. She didn’t have a drink till she was 21 and has recurring panic dreams of being arrested for something she didn’t do.\n\nShe’s still thinking about that wild thing and drawing blanks but the more she thinks about it the more unapologetic she becomes. \n\nThere is a core of steel to Swift that has – along with her song writing – won her praise from some of the toughest and most difficult to impress.\n\nNeil Young says he likes her. 'I like her music, I like watching her respond to her attacks, I like the way she’s defining herself.'\n\nElvis Costello says: 'You can see self-possession there and I’m intrigued by that.'\n\nShe likes to throw parties for her girlfriend but no TVs are chucked out of hotel windows, no eggs (sorry Justin) are thrown at neighbours walls.\n\n'For me relaxing is cooking, baking. In the winter I bake, I make pumpkin loaves and chocolate chip cookies, in the summer I cook. I do a great Japanese stir fry with chicken and vegetables and pasta with vegetables and vodka sauce.'\n\nWhen she comes to Britain for her tour she’s hoping to see something of the Great British Bake Off.\n\n'I’ve heard of that show,' she says. 'I really want to see it because I’m completely passionate about baking and I love watching other people bake. I’d definitely like to see Mary Berry.'\n\nSwift is the product of a highly educated, middle class family who put manners, morals and personal development high on the family agenda.\n\nThe daughter of three generations of banking executives, she was brought up in the affluent area of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania on an 11 acre Christmas Tree Farm, the family owned as a secondary business.\n\nFrom the age of nine thanks to a combination of loving Shania Twain, seeing Dolly Parton and listening to a LeAnn Rimes album her parents bought her as her first ever record, she knew she wanted to be a country singer. Her mother, Andrea, encouraged her first to paint then to paint in words.  \n\nIt was not a decision that made her popular at school where everyone else was into Britney (Spears) Justin (Timberlake) and Destiny’s Child. She’d run into the toilets during break times to sit in a cubicle and sing a few lines of lyrics she had just thought up. \n\nShe wore folk style bandanas in her hair and talked about ‘switchbacks’ (a lyric that zig-zags back on itself, a favourite device in country music) .\n\n'I was an oddball,' she says. 'And I was way taller than everyone else (she is a 5,11) with curly frizzy hair. People can be very mean. I became a target, a very easy target because I was also very sensitive.'\n\nAt 12 she went to Nashville with her mum and a stack of CDs she’d made, running in and out of record companies delivering the discs while Andrea waited in the car outside. She persuaded her mother and stock-broker father to move to Nashville.\n\nBy 14 she had a record deal but was ‘shelved’ a year later. She pushed on. The words; ‘Never, never, never give up’ are embossed in swirly letters on the inside of her tour-bus.\n\nSuccess has not dulled her sensitivity. But in many ways it is that sensitivity that has given her success. Her confessional songs – many about lost love and broken dreams – have struck a major chord with her largely female following. She actually looks pretty close to a supermodel but in concert she talks to her audience as if she is the eternal wallflower, the geeky, gawky uncertain one.\n\nShe is known for not discussing in interviews past romances with the likes of One Direction’s Harry Styles, the super-bad boy, John Mayer, the American royal, Conor Kennedy, or the commitment phobe Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nIn the press she is sometimes painted as a man-chaser ('I never chase boys, they don’t like it.') whose music consists of revenge songs directed at the men who let her down. There are whole websites devoted to working out which song is directed at which ex – Dear John for John Meyer and We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Again is thought to be about Gyllenhaal. Swift will neither confirm nor deny.\n\nIt’s actually a pretty smart policy. Not only does it stoke massive interest in each of her four albums, but any such revelations could spark savage repercussions.\n\nWhen One Directioners took I Knew You Were Trouble from her best-selling Red album to be about Harry (it was actually written before they even dated) she received death threats on Twitter from his fans urging her to 'drink bleach'.\n\nTo Swift it is simply what she does. Her idols from Parton to Stevie Nicks to Carly Simon, Eminem and Joni Mitchell all poured their lives and love affairs into their songs. \n\nAt school, she wrote about girls being mean, about being the odd one, the kid who didn’t fit in.\n\n'One of the great joys about writings songs is that it enabled me to have the last word.'\n\nShe adds: 'Songs are my diaries, they always have been. You have to put your trust in everyone because putting down those real, personal details and thoughts that make a song authentic also opens you right up. I am constantly misunderstood; a lot of people just don’t get me.'\n\nShe pauses. 'It’s like how I’m perceived to be constantly going out with people. I’m just not. It’s like she’s a hopeless romantic so she’s a serial monogamist, always dating.\n\n'They look at me and think: ‘Oh she has to be in love or she’s not happy.’ It is possible for a woman to be a romantic but also to be single and to be happy.'\n\nFor the record then, is she single or is she in fact (as has been reported) dating either Ed Sheeran or Jared Leto.\n\n'I am single,' she says. 'To be honest being single is one of the best things about my life right now. And whatever people think I actually love it.\n\n'Life is so much more fun and it’s great not to have to worry about calling someone every night, just doing what you want to do. Hanging out with your friends.'\n\n'People say the more famous you become the smaller your circle of friends becomes but for me it’s been the opposite'\nSwift is far more complex, far more intelligent than most of the stories about her give her credit for. Like Adele, she is one of the few female stars who writes their own songs. Her lyrics are clever, assured and her progression as a writer is clear.\n\nStevie Nicks rates her: 'It’s women like her who are going to save the music business.'\n\nShe studies the song writing of her heroes.\n\n'Sometimes I’ll go into the Canyons in LA and just think about all those incredible musicians who used to live there. I think you still feel an incredible energy there. I’d love to have been around then.'\n\nFor the past few weeks she has had an unprecedented number of days off. She has spent the time hiking, making granola ('It’s so good.') watching re-runs of Friends, Sex And The City, Law And Order and endless loops of her favourite movies 500 Days Of Summer and Love Actually.\n\nShe’s also been reading a lot of American classics: 'For Christmas my brother (21-year-old Austin) bought me the best ever present, a collection of books called The University Library, it has poems, novels, short stories. I love it.\n\n'I spend a lot of time at bookstores buying beaten up vintage books. You can lose yourself in a book like you can in a song and as a songwriter, you can learn just by reading the way other people write.'\n\nWhat makes Swift so likeable is her habit of looking outside herself. She talks about sitting next to Julia Roberts at the Golden Globes: 'We just started talking straight away. What struck me about her was not how beautiful she was but how youthful she was. She seemed younger than me and just extraordinary. She has a real grace.\n\n'She is how I’d like to be. I want to grow up with grace, to age gracefully and to love life. Julia was just so full of life.'\n\nShe asks questions, talks about other musicians (Sheeran, Ellie Goulding), movies she’s seen (American Hustle) the way Eminem can tell a story.\n\nShe has a lot of friends including the actresses Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence, Selena Gomez and Girls writer Lena Durham who she’s grown particularly close to.\n\n'People say the more famous you become the smaller your circle of friends becomes but for me it’s been the opposite.\n\n'I didn’t have a lot of friends growing up and now I’m surrounded by all these amazing, strong women who are incredibly supportive.\n\n'Like Lena. She’s crazy busy but she’ll always take my call. I can call her in the night and she’d be there to laugh with me or to chill with me or to hold my hand. And I’d be there for her.'\n\nYou can’t help wonder if the media misunderstanding of Taylor Swift will put her off dating for good. And what would happen to her music.\n\nThere is a pause and then she laughs. 'I just don’t Google. I’m unapologetically okay with myself. I refuse to believe the good hype and I refuse to believe the bad hype. Life is good.'\n\nSee Taylor Swift The Red Tour at the O2 London on the 2nd, 4th, 10th & 11th February.

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Taylor Swift Has No Regrets\nWayback in 2008, Glamour's entertainment editor W asked me whether I'd, quote, \"heard about this girl Taylor Swift.\" I looked her up; I hummed along. It seemed like her year. I went to Madison Square Garden to see her. She was charming and game-but I had no idea what the future would hold.\nSix years and a full four Glamour covers later, Taylor Swift is one of the world's most successful and visible pop stars. She can sell out a stadium in 20 minutes. Her name is mentioned four times as often as Kim Kardashian's on Twitter. Her long list of rumored boyfriends is famous enough to merit its own Wikipedia entry (we're summarizing, but: Joe Jonas, Taylor Lautner, John Mayer, Jake Gyllenhaal, Zac Efron, Conor Kennedy, Harry Styles...oh, forget it, just buy the T-shirt). She girl-packs with other smart, got-it- together Hollywood types like Emma Stone, Hailee Steinfeld, and Lena Dunham; and she's even karaoke'd with a prince. (That'd be William. YouTube it!)\nBut most important, she's built an astonishing career-because under that fairy-tale sparkle, it turns out, was some serious, Lean In-level drive. At age 15, she walked out of her deal with RCA Records because she wanted to sing her own songs, not other peo- ple's. That was a good idea, it turns out: She's now the youngest musician ever to win the Album of the Year Grammy (for Fearless) and the first female artist to have two albums each sell more than a million copies in the first week. She's been named the world's most charitable celebrity two years running. We could go on for, like, ever-and if you got that reference? Well, that's Taylor's doing too Seventy-five years ago this spring, the first issue of Glamour featured actress Ann Sheridan on the cover. She was 24, as Tay- lor Swift is now. Men were into her (Sheridan once reportedly got\n250 marriage proposals in a week), women liked her style, and she was known for that rare celebrity blend of sincerity and humor. Well, Swift is today's quintessential Glamour star-and a perfect choice for this, our 75th anniversary issue. When we met up to talk at an Italian restaurant, it had been a year since her last cover: a year in which songs like \"22\" had defined female culture just as powerfully as Dunham's Girls had; a year in which she first felt not just the warmth but the heat of being famous; a year of more living. I wanted to hear how she was handling it all. So we ordered lattes and settled in.\nCINDI LEIVE: This is your fourth cover for Glamour, and you're only 24. I have to ask, do you feel like you're a grown-up yet?\nTAYLOR SWIFT: No...I'm not finished making irresponsible decisions and blindly exploring...and being curious about every thing.\nCL: It seems to be working-you've had this mega year. You're now the first woman in history to spend six weeks or more at number\none with three consecutive studio albums.\nTS: Wow. I don't keep up with my own press, apparently! [Laughs.] The year has been so fast; I'm finally getting to step back and enjoy\nwhat it's meant for Red to do so well. It's like the difference between being inside a snow globe and getting to take it off the shelf, shake it up, and see how pretty it is. I try to enjoy what's happening now, but then again, I have to pack my bag tonight for the trip I'm taking tomorrow. Working on this [next] album has been unbelievable.\nCL: How's it going so far?\nTS: I'm already in love with it. It's so different.\nCL: What's the new sound?\nTS: On Red I did three songs with Max Martin and Shellback-\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" \"I Knew You Were Trouble,\" and \"22.\" [All three made Billboard's Hot 100 top 20.] I think we'll be doing a lot more than three songs together on the next album. [Langhs.]\nCL: I definitely think of your albums as an evolution. It's not like you're trying on a completely different persona with each one.\nIS: I'm not trying to shed my skin. I'm trying to be a new version of the person I've been my whole life. That's what's held my fans and me together. For a group of millions, it's odd how close I feel to them.\nCL: You are the fifth most popular person in the world on Twitter, by the way, right behind President Obama. So you're in this constant conversation with girls and women. What are the things you hear over and over? What seem to be their biggest struggles?\nTS: Love issues. Confidence. Self-esteem. And I've noticed so many people need music right now. If they can't put into words what they're feeling, but a lyric does, that can become almost a lifesaving device. As a musician it's the most incredible compliment. CL: Let's talk about real-life girlfriends. I was loving your Instagrams of you and Hailee Steinfeld the other day. TS: She came over and we made cookies!\nCL: Who's a new friend you've made over the year since we last talked? Anyone new in the circle?\nIS: Yeah, let me look at my texts. That'll help.\nCL: That's a good way. Who are your last texts from? IS: My brother. Selena [Gomez], Joy Williams from The Civil\nWars. That girl Lorde...\nCL: You're texting with Lorde?\nIS: I sent her flowers when her album came out, and she got my\nnumber and texted me. [Still looking at texts.] And Lily Aldridge,\nwho called me up last year and said, \"I'm with the president of Vic- toria's Secret, who wants you to play the show, and I do too.\" And I said, \"Yes, of course.\"\nCL: You did that in November. How did it go?\nIS: It was the most fun thing I've done on TV. Those women are in incredible shape! They work out harder than athletes.\nCL: Of course, there was that whole kerfuffle online with the model\nJessica Hart, who said you were great but \"didn't fit\" at Victoria's\nSecret. [Hart later said that her quote had been taken out of con- text.] Did that just roll off your back?\nTS: Well, it's not a matter of letting things roll off your back. If I see a headline that says that somebody \"threw shade\" at me, I just don't\nclick on it. It's that easy.\nIS: I know when not to read an article. Is it going to help my day?\nCL: You didn't read about it at all?\nIs it important for my life? If the answer is no, then I just don't click.... I'm careful about getting sucked into the rabbit hole that is the Internet because, as a songwriter, I don't have the option of having thick skin. As a writer you have to be open to everything, and that includes pain, rejection, self-doubt, fear. I deal with that enough on my own. If you look hard enough, you could find somebody on the Internet criticizing every single thing about\nyou. If you're me. CL: If you're high profile..\nTS: There's a huge amount of fictionalization of my life [in the media]...but my fans trust that I'm going to tell them what actually happened.... I find [songwriting] much more romantic than a tell- all interview.\nCL: That reminds me of something else you said recently I thought was smart-that it's sexist to criticize somebody for doing what we should all be doing: encouraging girls and women to express their experiences through writing. Let's talk about that a little.\nTS: The thing people always write about me, which is almost cli- ché, is \"Just watch out-she's going to write a song about that.\" As if writing a song isn't special. As if I'm living my life-\nCL: For material.\nTS: Yeah, like it's a trick I do.... It's not simple to write a song. The hardest times in my life have produced the songs that have done best... I've learned that I'm going to go through really high highs and really low lows. I don't always pick the right people to trust. But\nI'm not going to stop trusting people. CL: That's good advice. It seems like a lot of young singers today have a real struggle between wanting to push the envelope and live their lives while also being role models. How do you balance that?\nTS: I find it relatively easy to keep my clothes on because I don't\nreally feel like taking them off. It's not an urge I have. For me \"risky\"\nis revealing what really happened in my life through music. Risky is writing confessional songs and telling the true story about a person with enough details so everyone knows who that person is. That's putting myself out there, maybe even more than taking my shirt off. CL: Speaking of clothes: You have great style, and it's been a major influence on your fans. There were a lot of flower crowns out there for a lot of years, thanks to you! Who are your fashion muses these days?\nTS: Now I'm looking at women like Audrey Hepburn, Françoise Hardy, Jane Birkin.\nCL: So it's a cool semi-European sixties, seventies moment.\nTS: I'm also obsessed with Cyd Charisse [the American dancer and CL actress]. She was tall, like me. And sexy without trying to be.\nCL: Give me some Glamour Don'ts.\nTS: I don't wear fur. I don't wear animal print. Don't look good in shoulder pads. Shoes with excessive spikes just look like a weapon to me.\nCL: What are your own Glamour Don't moments?\nTS: When I was 16 and 17, I wore a lot of prom-y things. And I didn't really have anyone telling me, \"Hey, maybe less sparkles and less prom?\" That's the closest thing I have to cringeworthy.\nCL: Well, then you're doing pretty well! I heard you were giving out dating advice on the Glamour shoot. To the hair and makeup team?\nTS: Oh my God. I talk about this stuff all the time. \nCL: Here's something our readers ask about constantly: When you feel like a guy you're dating has the upper hand, how do you change the game?\nTS: Freeze-out.\nCL: What's the freeze-out?\nIS: You don't respond to any of his texts or calls until he does something desperate [like] shows up. Or he calls and leaves a voice mail. Something that makes it very clear to you that he's interested.\nCL: Have you employed the freeze-out?\nTS: [Nods. Pauses.] I think everyone should approach relationships from the perspective of playing it straight and giving someone the benefit of the doubt. Until he establishes that this is a game. And if it's a game, you need to win. The best thing to do is just walk away from the table.\nCL: Is that winning?\nTS: It is when they come back. [Laughs.] And if they don't, then they didn't care enough to begin with. \nCL: Another reader question: Is it too clingy and too insecure to say \"I don't like it when you don't text me back right away\"? \nTS: Guarding your heart and protecting your dignity are a little bit more important than clarifying the emotions of someone who's only texting you back three words. I've learned that from trying to figure out people who don't deserve to be figured out. When someone seems mysterious, we like to romanticize that he's \"deep\" or \"complicated.\" But a lot of the time, things are exactly as they seem..... For a long time I was drawn to-and still am drawn to-people I find very interesting. [But] someone who sits and talks about themselves for an hour, you start to maybe wonder if, rather than trying so hard to be interesting, they could be a little bit more interested.\nCL: Is this a dating observation?\nTS: It's a human being observation.\nCL: Give us a few more tricks.\nTS: Never yell.\nCL: Never yell?\nTS: Silence speaks so much louder than screaming tantrums. Never give anyone an excuse to say that you're crazy.\nCL: So will you continue to write about your personal life? \nTS : One of my big goals as a human being is to continue to write what's really happening to me, even if it's a tough pill to swallow for people around me... I do fear that if I ever were to have someone in my life who mattered, I would second-guess every one of my lyrics.\nCL: But why? It would seem that if you did find that person, your honesty would be something he'd love and support. \nTS: Because sometimes what I write isn't necessarily a greeting card. Sometimes it's a confession of something that really hurt me. \nCL: This is an anniversary issue. What's your fantasy for, say, 20 years from now, when you're 44?\nTS: Oh God. I'd like to have a lot of friends. I'd like to know how to make a good cup of tea. I'd like to have read a lot more classic books. I'd like to have a house with a fireplace. I'd like to be known as some- one my friends can talk about their troubles with.\nCL: And if you could turn back time five years and give your younger self a piece of advice, what would it be? \nTS: You know, I would not give myself any advice, because I wouldn't change anything. I would repeat the same regrets, the same mistakes, the same wonderful, beautiful, accidental triumphs.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Q&A: Why Taylor Swift Thinks Nashville Is the Best Place on Earth\nNashville is more than the heart of Taylor Swift’s business, it’s her home. But the city she came to as 13-year-old aspiring singer has grown far beyond its musical roots; it’s now an economic and cultural powerhouse. TIME’s Alex Rogers spoke to Swift about her favorite city for this week’s magazine feature which looks at the unique alchemy that makes Nashville both a classic American city and a modern success story. Here are excerpts of their conversation.\n\nTIME: Why did you decide to live in Nashville?\n\nSWIFT: I decided to move to Nashville when I was about 10 years old. I was obsessed with watching biography TV shows about Faith Hill and Shania Twain, and I noticed that both of them went to Nashville to start their careers. From that point on, I began relentlessly nagging, begging, and pleading with my parents to take me on a trip there. When I was 11, my mom took my brother and me to Nashville on spring break and we drove up and down Music Row. She would wait in the car as I scampered into record labels one by one, handing my demo CD to the receptionists. I remember thinking it was so odd and wonderful that all of these important record labels were all on one street, most of them in small buildings and old houses. I remember being charmed by how kind people were to strangers and newcomers like us. We took more and more trips to Nashville as time went by, and when at 13, I was offered a development deal by a major record label, my parents gave in and we moved from Pennsylvania.\n\nTIME: Have you ever considered moving your operations to L.A. or New York?\n\nSWIFT: I love L.A. and New York and I spend a lot of time there promoting albums and doing photo shoots. I’ve been lucky enough to find friends who live in New York, L.A., and Nashville, so none of those cities ever feel foreign or lonely. Choosing to have my management company based in Nashville just made sense because my family is there as well as my record label. I never think about moving home bases. It’s hard to describe why you consider a town your home base, except that when people ask me “Where’s home?”, I don’t even think before I say “Nashville.”\n\nTIME: How much time do you spend in Nashville?\n\nSWIFT: I spend as much time in Nashville as I can. The cool thing about spending time in Nashville is that no one knows when I’m there. In New York and L.A., there are photographers waiting on the street, and it seems like every errand I run is photographed and documented. You don’t see as much evidence of me spending time in Nashville, because I’m not being photographed at the grocery store. I’m just able to wander around the grocery store and make casual conversation with the girl standing next to me in the produce aisle.\n\nTIME: How has Nashville changed over the years?\n\nSWIFT: Nashville has changed so much since I moved here almost ten years ago. It’s become a popular, trendy place to live for families and young professionals. It’s become a well-known music hub for genres other than just country. There are now fantastic, highly acclaimed restaurants and top of the line hotels. New high-rise buildings have popped up every time I come home and I think it’s so awesome that Nashville is booming. The attention it’s getting is well deserved.\n\nTIME: How close is the city’s country music community?\n\nSWIFT: The country music community is the closest musical community I’ve witnessed. I see a different songwriter or producer I’ve worked with almost every time I’m out to dinner. All of the artists know each other. Half of us have opened up for the other half on tour, and we’ve met each other at some radio station or awards show. I could list at least five other country artists who live in my apartment building, so I actually run into them in the elevator on a regular basis.\n\nTIME: What’s your favorite spot in the city?\n\nSWIFT: I absolutely love the parks and trails. There’s a park called Radnor Lake that’s gorgeous on a fall day. I’ve had some of my best days walking there with my dad, talking about life. Another huge priority for me is having a good coffee place to go and hang out. Fido has such a great atmosphere, and you can wander around browsing the shops in Hillsboro Village once you’re there. I love driving past the Bluebird Cafe, because that’s where I played the acoustic show that ended up getting me a record deal. The other areas where I like to go for cute restaurants and shopping are 12th South and East Nashville. Now I have to stop because I sound like I am the president of the Nashville Tourism Board. Sorry, not sorry, I just love it here.",

      "Transcript/Content": "I feel a freedom to cover my own songs, or almost an obligation to try them out onstage as a way of testing to see if, “Oh yeah, this is actually good, this actually works.” Last year I did a gig in L.A. and I decided that I was going to sing “Treacherous,” a song that I had written with Taylor Swift. It was so fun to sing and it communicated so well that I was like, “Oh, this is a really good song; I could sing this to my people.”\n\nAVC: What’s the process when you’re writing with someone else?\n\nDW: It depends on how they work. With Taylor, we had been kind of circling around, very much aware of each other’s work for a while. We figured out these two days to work together and she came to my studio super excited and said, “I had an idea in the car.” And she sang me the first three or four lines of it and said, “I want to call it ‘Treacherous’ and maybe the chorus can go like this.” And we were writing the song in 10 minutes and she was just so full of excitement.\n\nIt’s interesting because I find that she’s very sincere and very what-you-see-is-what-you-get. When you see her on an award show and she wins the award and she looks astonished, that’s how she looks when you’re writing a song and you come up with a good lyric or a good melodic idea. She looks amazed; she’s like, “Whoa!” She’s just like that. She’s also very consistent and a monster songwriter.\n\nAVC: She’s 24 years old. She’s allowed to be sincere.\n\nDW: And that’s the kind of person you’re dealing with. She’s that way from beginning to end.",

      "Transcript/Content": "12 Things You Never Knew About Taylor Swift, Straight from the Star Herself\nThe last movie she watched, the last gift she gave a friend—we got the whole scoop.\nBY NAOMI NEVITT\n\nMAY 9, 2014\nImage may contain Taylor Swift Jacket Coat Clothing Apparel Human Person Face and Brittny Gastineau\nMe and Taylor at yesterday's Keds and Nordstrom event!PHOTO: NIKKO LAMERE\nTaylor Swift has revealed a lot about herself through her music over the last eight years. Favorite color? Red, duh. Best year or her life? 22 of course. Lucky number? Naturally it's 13. But what TV show does she binge watch on the weekends like the rest of us? What superpower would she choose?\n\nWhen I had the chance to talk to the seven-time Grammy award winner at her Keds Perfect Pairs event at Nordstrom in Los Angeles yesterday, I decided to find out! I asked a series of rapid-fire questions designed to reveal some cold, hard facts (you know, like what's her spirit animal), all in hopes of giving you a little extra insight into one of the world's biggest stars.\n\nWearing striking blue eyeliner and one of her many signature short sleeve dresses in a matching shade of cobalt, Taylor graciously took the hot seat, and here's what she had to say:\n\nWhat's the last book you read?\n\nA book about Zelda Fitzgerald.\n\nWhat's the last website you visited?\n\nAnthropologie.com. And real estate websites which I have to stop doing.\n\nWhat's the last song you listened to?\n\n\"Cop Car\" by Keith Urban. You gotta listen to it. It's my jam.\n\nWhat's the last song you sang along to?\n\n\"Sing\" by Ed Sheeran.\n\nWhat's the last movie watched?\n\nRunaway Bride.\n\nWhat's the last TV show you watched?\n\nFriends last night—a marathon!\n\nWhat's the last app used?\n\nAn astrology one. And it just said, \"Be yourself today.\" And I was like, thanks? It's like when you get a very generic fortune cookie and you're like, \"This doesn't help me. I really needed you today and you didn't give me anything real.\" I think I need to buy the real app. I don't think they give you a lot on the free one.\n\nWhat's the last museum or monument you visited?\n\nThe Met because I was at the Met Ball. You walk through the entire museum exhibit to get to the party. I think wearing a ball gown and being with your friends is pretty sick.\n\nWhat's the last gift you gave a friend?\n\nIt was random—one of those tiny little emergency kits that have all the things in it a girl would need, like a mini sewing kit. You know, those little glittery bags you can get at Sephora and put in your purse.\n\nWhat's your spirit animal?\n\nA fox. Because they have to run and hide a lot and I have to run and hide a lot too. I didn't mean that to sound sad! In my head it sounded like more of a statement and when I said it, it sounded like something you say before you cry. [Laughs]\n\nIf you had one superpower what would it be?\n\nHealing people.\n\nWhat's your motto?\n\n\"I got 99 problems\"—no, I'm just kidding. Did you ever watch the movie Love Actually where Hugh Grant's voiceover says, \"If you look around, love actually is all around\"? That's my favorite motto.\n\nAs you can see, I left feeling a little bit more enlightened about our favorite Nashville export. And maybe also a teeny bit smug—when her next hit single comes out and talks about fos, I'll know exactly what she means.",

      "Transcript/Content": "MULTI-TAY-LANTED!\nLIKE WATCHING TAY PERFORM HER SONG “ALL TOO WELL”\nTHE ENTIRE RED TOUR SHOW IN JAKARTA WAS ALL TOO PERFECT!\nTaylor Swift’s concert will make your heart completely fall, both for the artist as well as for the event.  Even those who often watch her concerts on YouTube would definitely be stunned.\n\nThe fanfare of the RED Tour Concert that most fans were hoping for was experienced just as imagined. The flow, gimmick, wardrobe, stage, crowd, and even the meet-and-greet - which previously we had only seen through Internet videos - all became real and were really felt by thousands of fans at the venue, Mata Elang International Stadium (MEIS), Jakarta, last Wednesday (June 4, 2014).\n\nThe show started at 20:30 PM Western Indonesian time. The red curtain, and the silhouette of Taylor Alison Swift, appeared together, marking the start of the concert. The Nashville singer sang the first track from her RED album, State of Grace.\n\nShe appeared on stage wearing a white shirt and high-waisted black shorts, along with black stockings covering her long legs. There was a reason why - for the entire concert - Tay neatly covered her beautiful legs.  Clearly Tay was respecting the advice of the concert promoter to not appear too sexy. As most people still remember, Lady Gaga had to cancel her Jakarta concert after she ignored similar advice.\n\n“Good evening Jakarta, I’m Taylor. Welcome to the RED Tour Jakarta!” She spoke, along with a smile from her bright red lips.  On stage, Tay was like a chameleon that could change from a calm sweet girl to an attractive young woman waving her blonde hair around.  In her Holy Ground number, Tay proved her skill as a stage performer. She beat the Taiko drums fully and soulfully with expression.\n\nWe appreciated the concept, as well as the flow, of the scenes that were presented on the stage. Tay and her crew must have performed such shows in other countries prior to their visit to Jakarta. But for the first-time viewers, watching this act in person would surely leave a remarkable impression.\n\nViewers were touched when Taylor explained that the real meaning of her RED album is the color of love, and she noticed that this was one of the colors of the Indonesian flag.  The video of a star’s life behind the stage, which was being played as the background when Taylor sang The Lucky One, showed the audience how difficult the process can be.\n\nPouring Her Heart on the Piano\nTay’s sociable and fun personality was also displayed by the way she communicated with the audience, as if we were a conversation with our own friend.  It starts with friendship, becomes love, and then you are pouring out each other’s hearts.\n\n“Usually, if someone asks me about my song writing, what they would like to know is how I wrote the song.  And my answer is simple: I wrote songs based on personal things that occurred in my life and haunt me.  It sounds depressing and sad, but that is what happened. There are lots of things that left scars inside, and on those sad days, I write songs. But sometimes, not only bad things happened.  Sometimes, good things haunt me too.”  She poured her heart out for a few seconds before she started to sing All Too Well on her piano. The song paused for a second, as Tay was holding the tears from falling to her cheeks. This was the most memorable moment.\n\nMulti-Talented\nPlaying the guitar, banjo, and piano, while maintaining the quality of her voice during the whole concert, adding her beauty inside-and-out, is the complete and special package that is Taylor Swift. The audience did not have to wait long for their favorite songs to come out of Swift’s red lips.  Most were mesmerized by the whole concert and concept.\n\nNot to be forgotten, Taylor danced, along with five other background dancers who accompanied her during her other numbers 22, Love Story, Mean, We’re Never Ever Getting Back Together and The Lucky One. Even the dance was presented in a number of distinctive themes, starting from classic to modern ones. There are not too many singers who can really dance on the stage. Tay is one of the few who can do both, though dancing is not her main skill.\n\nIn total, Tay sang 13 songs that night, creating unforgettable memories and a remarkable experience. I can still see her red lipstick, her glances, and how she talked.  Even while leaving the MEIS building, we all still sang to ourselves the song We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, which was the last number Tay sang that night.\n\nWe love you, Tay.\n\nFrom High Heels to Adam Young\nStarting a conversation with Taylor Swift was surprisingly easy. She was very open and friendly. Starting with a comment on her height, the discussion flowed smoothly. We even touched on guys too!\n\nQ: Hi Taylor!  Oh My God, is this really you? You are really tall!\n\nA: Hey, I’m Taylor. It’s very nice to meet you. I’m not that tall. I’m using high heels actually, so don’t be surprised.\n\nQ: This is your first visit to Indonesia, what made you and your management decide to hold the RED Tour here?\n\nA: Well, since two years ago, Indonesia has been on my priority list. But since there was a scheduling issue, I have only been able to hold a concert here now. Because my fans here kept continuously sending me their Tweets, I made up my mind, “I must go there this year!”\n\nQ: So, for the RED Tour this time, you chose lots of uncommon countries such China and Indonesia, why?\n\nA: I just wanted to experience something new.  Early on, I was not very confident in facing the challenge of concerts in these locations. But presented with the reality that all tickets to these concerts sold out, I could only think “How could such countries that I have never visited before be this excited?”\n\nQ: The Asian cultures and languages are much different to yours.  Why do you think your CD sales in Asia are huge?\n\nA: I don’t know why my music is so popular in Asia. But I feel really flattered since English is not their mother-tongue.   They really tried to learn from my songs, and to sing them while I’m on stage. So I feel so proud to be able to have such a great influence on them.\n\nQ: Now let’s talk about music.  Which part of the process are you most passionate about during creation of a new album?\n\nA: For me, song writing is my favorite process when making a new album. In the early days, I really liked to write poems. But as time went by, I found out that writing a song is much more exciting. Though sometimes I do like to sing randomly without actually knowing what the real meaning is.\n\nQ: When is your new album coming out?   Where is it now in the recording process?\n\nA: I am currently working hard to finish my new album as fast as I can. I cannot reveal any details yet.  What is clear is that this will be the favorite thing I have done in my whole life, more than the previous ones. Perhaps, between October and November would be the right time to release it.\n\nQ: Talking about guys, there were lot of songs in your previous albums - and in RED - that were inspired from your previous relationship experiences. And there are many who disagree with the concept, including John Mayer. What can you say about this? [Comment from Poetrydude66:  Based on answer below, it might be the case that Taylor did not hear John Mayer’s name in this question and thought she was answering a more general question.  Given all of the translations, give Taylor the benefit of the doubt.]\n\nA: Well, if I want to write songs for my exes, they also have the right to write a song about me. So, what is the real problem? I am not the only one who could write songs about them. If they want, just respond to it!\n\nQ: Okay now, how about Adam Young?   You made a song about him, Enchanted, which later on he covered back to you.   Why isn’t there any response?   [Comment from Poetrydude66: Wow, there is no way I can rewrite that question as an easy pitch.  I did remove one phrase in the translation because in English the question became just too aggressive. ]\n\nA: Oh about that: there are lots of cover versions of my Enchanted. I did not pay too much attention to his version.   But they say it is good.\n\nQ: Thank you Taylor, for the time you spent chatting with me.  I still cannot believe that I finally met you!\n\nA: Oh, that’s sweet of you. You’re so welcome!",

      "Transcript/Content": "Q: What attracted you to The Giver?\nA: I read scripts all the time, and I have been in very tiny parts in one or two movies because I was always waiting for the right thing to come along to fully commit. When I read The Giver – first of all, I remembered reading the book, and I remember it deeply affecting me in school. But picturing the characters played by Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep, and these incredible actors who had already signed on to the project, it was absolutely an honor to be approached to play Rosemary.\n\nQ: Well, describe Rosemary for us. It’s interesting because Rosemary in the book doesn’t play piano. When you were given the script, was she already a piano player, or did you put that in there? How did that work?\nA: Rosemary is such an interesting character to me because she reminds me of an analogy for the modern-day artist: a lot of the time, you’ll have someone who is so fragile and so vunerable and so open, and that’s the reason why they are successfull at making art. But that can also be their downfall. Rosemary felt too much. She cared too much. She was exposed to too much, and she couldn’t handle it, and I think that we see that play out in modern-day society all the time.\nWhen I read the script, Rosemary was playing piano. It’s so interesting that she gets to be a musician, because in my mind, that is exactly the kind of vunerable, sensitive human being who would be chosen to remember memories, and who might be so sensitive and vunerable that they end up getting completely pulled into it, and go into a downward spiral because of it.\n\n\nQ: Memory is a very important part of this book. Your character exists in memories, and The Giver calls up different memories at different times. Do you have that experience in your own life? Are there certain memories that you take with you, that you really grab on to the way The Giver grabs on to the memory of Rosemary in difficult times?\nA: I think for me, in what I do with songwriting, it’s all about celebrating memory. Almost every song of mine is in past tense, looking back. I very rarely write songs about what’s happening right now. Most of it is about something I’m looking back on that I didn’t fully appreciate at the time but I do now. Retrospect is a very important part of my songwriting process, so to be a part of a movie that so perfectly celebrates retrospect…it’s just the perfect match.\n\nQ: Did you do anything to prepare for the role?\nA: In order to prepare for the role of Rosemary, I figured out what memory I had in my own life that would make me want to make the choice that she made. And it’s a memory that always brings me to a place where I can’t really talk about it without crying. I knew with Rosemary, if she was going to make a choice she made in the end, which is a relly tragic choice to make, that I was probably going to be crying in a scene, and so I got a memory and figured out what I would have to expose myselft to, emotionally, in order to get to that place.\nWhat I love is that Phillip [Noyce, the director] really brought to light different parts of Rosemary’s character that I didn’t get from reading the script. This is a very innocent free spirit, The Giver’s darling daughter, who was just sweet to her core. I think that was something that I really tried to bring to life: that she’s just such a soft, gentle person, and that in the end is why she wasn’t really tough enough to receive memories of loss and pain.\n\nQ: Can you give us a few of your thoughts on the book? What about the book do you think affects kids so deeply?\nA: I remember reading The Giver when I was in middle school, and it was so long ago that when I read the script, on page three it clicked with me – “Oh my God, I’ve read this before.” I had remembered elements of it. Emotion is such an important part of my life, and now I guess my job, because people wouldn’t listen to my songs if they weren’t heartbroken or deeply affected and hurt and jilted and sad and bitter and all those wonderful things that I write songs about. Emotion is such an important part of everything in my world. So the idea that people would be conditioned not to know what that even is – I can’t imagine that kind of world. I really can’t. Where there’s no such thing as falling in love. There’s no such a thing as wanting something you can’t have. There’s no such a thing as finding something to be so unique and one of a kind – and music, the idea that there wouldn’t be music in the world. All those things hit me so, so hard when I read that book, and reading it again, it all came flooding back.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor-made for fans\n\nCall her golden girl or goody-two shoes, but it is not easy being Taylor Swift.\n\nShe has maintained her position as one of the world's biggest pop starlets in the past few years while being relatively untainted by controversy, even as every detail of her personal life is lapped up by fans and put under the glare of social and traditional media.\n\nIf rival Miley Cyrus is the exhibitionist riding on her out-there brand of sexuality, Swift is the tease whose self-penned songs appear to be confessional without revealing much.\n\nDespite much speculation that recent songs such as her 2010 hit single Back To December and Dear John are about famous ex-boyfriends such as Twilight star Taylor Lautner and singer John Mayer, Swift herself has always been tight-lipped about her muses.\n\nForget, too, about any Justin Bieber-style public meltdowns from the 24-year-old from Pennsylvania, who got her start as a country singer before making a hugely successful crossover to pop.\n\nIn a 10-minute telephone interview with Life! from Tokyo - a stop in her current, wildly popular The Red world tour - she says that having to deal with living in the public eye has made her very careful about keeping the less savoury side of her behind closed doors.\n\n\"It's interesting because every day of my life is documented in some way, either there's paparazzi outside my apartment or fans see me at a restaurant and they tweet about it,\" says the singer, who will be here to perform two nights at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on Monday and June 12.\n\n\"And that's an interesting thing to come to terms with because some days, you're completely in the mood to meet strangers and you want to meet as many people as possible.\n\n\"And then there are days when you know when you have a bad day and you don't want to meet anyone or talk to anyone. When I wake up and I have sort of a bad attitude once in a while, I know I can't leave the house because it's not an option to not talk to people,\" she says.\n\n\"My life is a very social experience these days,\" she adds with a laugh.\n\nStaying at home when she has gotten up on the wrong side of bed is the price of success. She topped Billboard's list of highest-paid musicians of last year, making close to US$40 million (S$50 million) through music sales, royalties and digital music and video-streaming revenue, not to mention the sold-out stadiums on The Red tour in support of her latest album of the same name.\n\nLike her counterpart and former child star Cyrus, Swift practically grew up in the music business.\n\nInspired as a pre-teen by crossover country-pop acts such as The Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain, the waif-like blonde started performing around Pennsylvania. To aid her budding singing and songwriting career, Swift's family moved to an outlying suburb in America's songwriting capital, Nashville.\n\nThe move paid off tremendously when her selftitled debut, released at the age of 16, became an instant hit, staying at the top of Billboards country music charts for 24 weeks and peaking at No. 5 in the mainstream charts.\n\nSince then, all her albums, Fearless (2008), Speak Now (2010) and Red (2012) have all peaked at No. 1 on the main Billboard charts. To date, she has sold 26 million albums and 75 million digital single downloads.\n\nSwift is also one the most decorated young music stars of recent times, with a truckload of awards that includes seven Grammys (she is the youngest artist ever to win Album of the Year), 15 American Music Awards, 12 Billboard Music Awards (she is the youngest artist to pick up Woman of the Year) and 11 Country Music Association Awards.\n\nIn November last year, Swift was awarded one of country music's highest honours - the Country Music Association Awards' Pinnacle Award. The only other artist to have picked up the trophy, given to country artists who have achieved global success and recognition, is American country juggernaut Garth Brooks, 28 years her senior.\n\nHer rise from Nashville to global pop superstardom can be summed in how music magazine Rolling Stone described her in two separate articles - she was deemed \"country music darling\" in a 2008 article but by 2012, she was already \"pop's unstoppable princess\".\n\nHer dainty good looks belie a canny singersongwriter whose infectious country-pop melodies and whimsical, straight-talking lyrics have connected with legions of fans. While not one to kiss and tell, she emphasises that her lyrics are a document of the things that have happened to her in real life.\n\nShe explains: \"In a huge sense, documenting my life is a No. 1 priority and documenting it as accurately as possible in the form of music.\n\n\"Priority No. 2 is making sure that I'm documenting my life in a way that the fans can understand and isn't too over their heads or things they want to hear.\"\n\nHer fans, she will have you believe, drive every aspect of her creative decisions, especially the songs that she plays in her many sold-out shows.\n\n\"Pretty much everything I do is based on what they want, not what I want. I don't play my favourite songs that were not popular in concert, I play the songs they want to hear.\"\n\nThe same principle applies to her yet-to-bereleased new album, her fifth and the follow-up to Red, which has sold more than five million copies to date.\n\n\"Moving forward in my career, we're in a very important planning stage right now, getting everything together for the next project.\n\n\"Every single choice that I make is determined by what I think (fans) will like and what I think will be good for them to see or hear on the new album.\"\n\nShe was secretive about the new songs though and declined to give details, not even the date when they are expected to be released.\n\nWith a laugh, she says: \"I wish so badly that I could talk about the new record, I really do, that's all I want to talk about, it's all I think about, I'm obsessed with it.\n\n\"All I can really tell you is that it's my favourite thing of all I've ever done and I promise you, you'll know why.\"\n\nSwift was less guarded when it came to the subject of her Asian tour, the final leg of The Red which started in March last year. Her Singapore date on June 12 is the last stop on the tour, which has taken her all over North America, Europe and Australia.\n\n\"I think one of the things that's really cool is that my fans all seem to be very similar in spirit and the things they love,\" she says of playing for her fans in Asia.\n\n\"They love lyrics, they tend to be optimistic and they tend to be nice to one another and they love dressing up in crazy costumes for the show and memorising all the words to the songs, but different things separate fans in different cultures, there are different gifts they give you.\"\n\nHer fans in China, where she played for the first time last month, gave her coffee mugs with cats on them (\"which was really nice because I like coffee mugs and I like cats\"), while her followers in Japan tend to give her traditional Japanese fans.\n\n\"But they also give a lot of hair accessories, which I really like because now that my hair is short, pretty much all I can do with it is a hairclip or a headband.\"\n\nSwift is looking forward to her gig in Singapore, which will feature local act Imprompt-3, winners of the Cornetto's Ride To Fame Competition to pick the concert's opening act.\n\nShe last played a sold-out show at the Indoor Stadium in 2011. Tickets to her return concert on June 12 sold out quickly. After her Bangkok gig on Monday was cancelled with the Thai army's declaration of martial law, Swift added another Singapore show on the same night. Extra tickets were also released for the June 12 show.\n\nAccording to the organisers, 70 per cent of the tickets on Monday have been sold so far.\n\nAnd just like with her last gig, the plan is for her mother to come with her. Swift's mother actually spent part of her growing up years in Singapore when Swift's grandfather, who worked for an engineering company, moved here for work.\n\n\"My mum grew up in Singapore,\" the singer tells you as a parting shot, before your allotted interview time is up. \"Her parents were travelling around for my grandfather's job. It was always really wonderful to bring her back so she can see her old neighbourhood and see where she grew up, I think it's really nostalgic for her.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Dismisses the Haters, Dances With Fans for New Song ‘Shake it Off’\nSinger reveals inspiration and deluxe package for upcoming album '1989' and premieres shapeshifting new video\n\nBy Daniel Kreps\n\nAugust 18, 2014\n\nAfter a week of dropping hints, Taylor Swift finally hired a skywriting plane last Friday to spell out “TAYLOR SWIFT 8/18 5PM YAHOO” above New York City, suggesting to fans that the “22” singer might finally be dropping some new music from her much-anticipated fifth album. When the clock struck 5 p.m. EST on Monday, Swift delivered: As part of her Yahoo! live stream, Swift debuted her new single “Shake It Off” in the form of an impromptu dance party with the studio audience. Swift also revealed that 1989, the follow-up to 2012’s Red, is set for release on October 27th and will be her “first straight-up pop album.” 1989 refers to the singer’s birth year, and Swift revealed that the music of the late-Eighties – “a time of limitless potential” – had a huge impact on her new LP, right down to the album cover: a Polaroid photo of the singer. \n\n“Two years gives you enough time to grow and change; change what you believe in and what’s influencing and inspiring you,” Swift said of the two years between Red and 1989. “In the process, my music changed. I woke up every single day not wanting, but needing, to make a new style of music. This album is a rebirth for me.”\n\n“Shake It Off” was co-written by Swift, Max Martin and Shellback, with the latter two producing the track. Martin and Shellback previously worked with Swift on the hit “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.” Immediately following the Yahoo! stream, 1989 was made available for pre-order on Swift’s official site (though her site crashed immediately following her announcement). Swift also revealed that the deluxe edition of the album will feature an envelope of 13 Polaroid photos and three bare bones versions of tracks that Swift recorded into her phone.\n\n“I’ve had every part of my life dissected — my choices, my actions, my words, my body, my style, my music,” Swift tells Rolling Stone about the new single. “When you live your life under that kind of scrutiny, you can either let it break you, or you can get really good at dodging punches. And when one lands, you know how to deal with it. And I guess the way that I deal with it is to shake it off.” Swift is also scheduled to perform at the MTV Video Music Awards in Englewood, California on August 24th, which is as good a venue as it gets to debut “Shake It Off” live.\n\n\nFinally, Swift premiered the “Shake It Off” music video, which she filmed in June over the course of three days in Los Angeles. Directed by legendary director Mark Romanek, the visionary behind Nine Inch Nails’ “Closer” and Janet and Michael Jackson’s “Scream,” the video finds Swift adopting a series of personas, including cheerleader, hip-hop B-girl and Lady Gaga-esque performance artist. “All I think about are metaphors and cats,” Swift said on the livestream. “And life can be greatly reflected in your willingness to dance.”\n\n“It was so much fun. I woke up every day of that shoot and couldn’t wait to get to set,” Swift tells Rolling Stone about the video shoot. “We had twerking, which was so funny. Those girls were trying to teach me how, and it’s just never gonna happen. I tried really hard. They were teaching me what they do, and there’s like a science to it – they’re like digging their heels into the floor without you seeing their legs move, but their butts’ moving. It’s mind-blowing to me. They were explaining it all to me, and it’s so above my comprehension of how to understand your body.”\n\nAs for the video’s concept, which finds Swift unable to master the art of moshing and ballet among other dance moves, Swift says, “It takes a long time to figure out who you are and where you fit in in the world. I’m putting myself in all these awkward situations where the dancers are incredible, and I’m having fun with it, but not fitting in. They’re doing the most beautiful things, and I’m being embarrassingly bad at it. It shows you to keep doing you, keep being you, keep trying to figure out where you fit in in the world, and eventually you will.”\n\nSwift was tight-lipped about her new album during her visit to The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on August 13th, not even biting when the late night host asked her if she’d “Beyoncé an album and just pop it out,” during the Yahoo! Announcement. \n\n“I think the goal for the next album is to continue to change, and never change in the same way twice,” she explained to Rolling Stone last year. “How do I write these figurative diary entries in ways that I’ve never written them before and to a sonic backdrop that I’ve never explored before? I’ll bring in ideas and they’ll take such a different turn than where I thought they were going to go, and that level of unexpected spontaneity is something that really thrills me in the process of making music. What if we did this? What if we made it weirder? What if we took it darker? I love people who have endless strange and exciting ideas about where music can go.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "The Reinvention of Taylor Swift\nShe’s left country behind, sworn off dating and built a fortress around her heart\n\nBy Josh Eells\n\nSo my brother comes home the other day,” Taylor Swift says, “and he goes, ‘Oh, my God – I just saw a guy walking down the street with a cat on his head.'”\n\nAs an ardent fan of ready-made metaphors, as well as of cats, Swift was excited by this. “My first reaction was, ‘Did you take a picture?'” she says. “And then I thought about it. Half of my brain was going, ‘We should be able to take a picture if we want to. That guy is asking for it – he’s got a cat on his head!’ But the other half was going, ‘What if he just wants to walk around with a cat on his head, and not have his picture taken all day?'”\n\n\nFor Swift – four-time multiplatinum-album-maker, seven-time Grammy winner and billion-time gossip-blog subject – being famous is a lot like walking around with a cat on your head. “I can have issues with it,” she says. “But at the end of the day, I can’t be ungrateful, because I chose this. But sometimes – sometimes – you don’t want to have a camera pointed at you. Sometimes it would be nice if someone just said, ‘Hey, I think it’s really cool that you have that cat on your head. I think that’s interesting.'”\n\nIt’s 1300 hours in the San Fernando Valley, and Project Sparrow is in full effect. In a nondescript parking lot at a soundstage in Van Nuys, California, a Blackwater-esque platoon of personal-security professionals stands at the ready. Every doorway and stairwell is guarded, and every window is blacked out. The occasion: a Taylor Swift video shoot.\n\ntaylor swift rolling stone cover\n\nIn 2014, a Swift shoot requires the kind of operational secrecy and logistical complexity rarely seen outside of a SEAL raid. Before Project Sparrow – the code name chosen by the video’s director, Mark Romanek – there was Project Cardinal, a multiweek mission where Swift’s social-media team scoured the Web for a representative group of fans to appear in the video. When one girl posted a photo of her invitation, she was quickly uninvited, then presumably renditioned to whatever CIA black site holds Swift’s enemies. (Jack Antonoff, of Bleachers and fun., who has recently co-written several songs with Swift, says that “just having her songs on my hard drive makes me feel like I have Russian secrets or something. It’s terrifying.”)\n\n\nAt the moment, Swift is in a makeup chair in her dressing room, getting false eyelashes applied. She’s wearing a black miniskirt, black tights and a fuzzy pink top with a cartoon drawing of a cat, and her wavy blond hair is pinned back tight. She’s five feet 10, but she looks much taller, even with her lanky legs wrapped underneath her like a pretzel twist. “I need lunch like, whoa,” Swift says, and an assistant tells her there’s a sushi order happening. “Oooh,” she purrs. “Get a boatload.”\n\n\nRelated\n\nWorld Cup: See England Fans Sing Oasis’ ‘Don’t Look Back in Anger’ After Loss\nSee Kacey Musgraves’ Glittery Disco Party in ‘High Horse’ Video\nSee Taylor Swift like you never have before in behind-the-scenes footage from Theo Wenner’s cover shoot here:\n\n\n\n\nThe video is for Swift’s soon-to-be-Number One single, “Shake It Off,” which she’ll perform for the first time at the VMAs later this summer, but which at this point only a handful of people outside the room even know exists. There are worries about spies and recording devices. “Don’t even get me started on wiretaps,” Swift says seriously. “It’s not a good thing for me to talk about socially. I freak out.” As for who might bug a Van Nuys production office on the off chance that Swift is inside: “The janitor,” she says, as if naming one candidate among hundreds. “The janitor who’s being paid by TMZ. This is gonna sound like I’m a crazy person – but we don’t even know. I have to stop myself from thinking about how many aspects of technology I don’t understand.”\n\nSwift pauses, as if weighing just how paranoid she’s comfortable with sounding. Then she plows ahead. “Like speakers,” she says. “Speakers put sound out . . . so can’t they take sound in? Or” – she holds up her cellphone – “they can turn this on, right? I’m just saying. We don’t even know.”\n\nSwift says she never feels completely safe, especially when it comes to her privacy. “There’s someone whose entire job it is to figure out things that I don’t want the world to see,” she says. “They look at your career, they look at what you prioritize, and they try to figure out what would be the most revealing or hurtful. Like, I don’t take my clothes off in pictures or anything – I’m very private about that. So it scares me how valuable it would be to get a video of me changing. It’s sad to have to look for cameras in dressing rooms and bathrooms. I don’t walk around naked with my windows open, because there’s a value on that.”\n\nAnd yet, despite the DEFCON-3 level of security, in a lot of ways Swift has never felt more free. She has a new album out in October, 1989, that she’s insanely excited about, because it signals her transition from a country star who likes pop to a straight-up pop star. She recently bought a luxe apartment in New York. And despite what you may have read in the gossip press, Swift hasn’t been involved with a man in quite some time. She’s not dating. She’s not canoodling. She’s not even sexting. Taylor Swift is single and loving it.\n\n\n“I really like my life right now,” she says. “I have friends around me all the time. I’ve started painting more. I’ve been working out a lot. I’ve started to really take pride in being strong. I love the album I made. I love that I moved to New York. So in terms of being happy, I’ve never been closer to that.” Which is not necessarily the same as being happy.\n\nThere’s one way into Swift’s new apartment building, and much of the time it’s guarded by a former NYPD officer named Jimmy, who unlocks the door for residents and visitors alike. This may be a drag for neighbors like Steven Soderbergh and Orlando Bloom, who have dropped seven figures to live at one of Tribeca’s toniest addresses, but it’s an unavoidable fact of life when the 24-year-old on the top floor is one of the biggest pop stars on the planet. “Most of the neighbors know what’s what by now,” Jimmy says, locking the door behind him. Today is a good day for Jimmy, because the elevator is working again after a brief period of being broken. “It’s six floors up,” he says, frowning. “And we don’t travel light, if you know what I mean.” I tell him I think I do know what he means, and Jimmy laughs. “The shoes alone!”\n\nUp in the penthouse, a barefoot Swift answers the door in a periwinkle-blue sundress: “Welcome to my apartment!” In the kitchen there’s an assortment of pastries from a hip downtown spot called the Smile (“They have these banana-quinoa muffins that I’m obsessed with”), and in the refrigerator are a surprising number of varieties of sparkling water. (“I have black cherry, pomegranate, blueberry, strawberry, key lime, tangerine lime . . .”)\n\nSwift shuts the fridge. “Do you want a tour?” She breezes into the living room, pointing out the fish tank filled with vintage baseballs (“I was like, ‘That’s so cool, they’re so old!'”) and some enormous scented candles (“I was like, ‘That’s so cool, they’re so big!'”). “There’s my piano,” she says. “Here’s my pool table that always has cat hair on it. That’s my skylight.” She bumps into a doorway. “That’s a door that I walk into.”\n\n\ntaylor swift rolling stone cover\n\nSwift bought this apartment about six months ago, for a reported $15 million. (Swift also bought the unit across the hall, for about $5 million; she uses it to house her security team.) It took a lot of work just to see it: It belonged to the director Peter Jackson, who had an actor friend crashing here, so the brokers didn’t want to bother him much. “Sir Ian McKellen,” Swift says seriously. “I think once you’re Gandalf, you can always just stay in Peter Jackson’s house.”\n\nSwift leads the way into one of her four guest bedrooms. “This is where Karlie usually stays,” she says – meaning supermodel Karlie Kloss, one of her new BFFs, whom she met nine months ago at the Victoria’s Secret fashion show. There’s a basket of Kloss’s favorite Whole Foods treats next to the bed, and multiple photos of her on the walls. Against another wall, there’s a rack full of white nightgowns. “This is a thing me and Lena have,” says Swift – meaning Lena Dunham, another recent friend. “We wear them during the day and look like pioneer women, fresh off the Oregon Trail.”\n\nSwift met Dunham in 2012, after she watched Girls and became obsessed. She went on Twitter to follow Dunham, and coincidentally saw that Dunham had just tweeted admiringly about Swift. “I was really scared she was being ironic, but I decided to follow her anyway, just in case. Within five minutes I had a direct message from her. Let me see if I still have it.” She spends a minute scrolling through her phone. “I still have it! She said, ‘I am so excited about the prospect of being friends with you that I added the adjective best in front of it.’ ‘The idea that you like my show is so thrilling, and I can’t wait to lavish you with praise in person.'”\n\nAs a recent New York transplant in her mid-twenties, Swift says Girls is like her Sex and the City. “I could label all my girlfriends as Shoshannas, Jessas, Marnies or Hannahs,” she says. And which would she be? “I’ve thought about this a lot,” she says. A pause. “I’m Shoshanna.”\n\n\nShe seems resigned to this. “Shoshanna gets excited about things, she’s really girly. And when she was in a relationship that was very comfortable, she made the decision to get out and go experience new things on her own. And now she’s becoming more sure of herself and taking life head-on, in a way that I can relate to. Even though I’ve never accidentally smoked crack at a warehouse party and run pantsless through Brooklyn.” (Dunham, meanwhile, thinks Swift is more like “Hannah, minus the horrid sexual behavior. Or Marnie, if she wasn’t an asshole.”)\n\nSwift leads the way upstairs to her bedroom. Asleep on her massive four-poster bed is a tiny white ball of fur. “Olivia!” Swift says, scooping her up. It’s her two-month old kitten, named after Olivia Benson, from Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. “Hear how loud she’s purring? She’s a stage-five clinger, for sure.” Downstairs somewhere is her other cat, Meredith, named after Meredith Grey from Grey’s Anatomy. “Strong, complex, independent women,” Swift says. “That’s the theme.”\n\nBehind the cover story: Josh Eells on what it’s really like spending time with Taylor:\n\n\n\nShe steps onto her patio and climbs the staircase up to the roof deck. “Careful,” she says. “It’s construction central.” A forest of skyscrapers surrounds her; the Freedom Tower looks close enough to touch. Swift gestures to a set of planters: “Those are hydrangeas, and over there are the roses and basil and rosemary.” Heading back downstairs, she passes an antique lamp with the inscription CALADIUM SEGUINUM on it. Swift took Latin in high school, but says she isn’t sure what it means. (Later, I look it up. It turns out it’s a homeopathic remedy for male impotence.)\n\nFor years, Swift was terrified to move to New York. “I was intimidated by it for so long,” she says. But now that she’s here, she loves it. She can walk down the street to get dinner, or go furniture shopping with friends in Brooklyn. Even the paparazzi are better, she says. “They don’t provoke me, or ask weird questions. And a lot of them are long-lensing it – which, if you have to have paparazzi in your life, is such a better way.” She likes it so much she’s trying to recruit friends to move here – like her buddy Selena Gomez. “Project Selena,” Swift says. “I think I can do it.”\n\n\nBack in the living room, Swift settles into the couch with a muffin and starts talking about her Fourth of July. She invited a bunch of friends up to Rhode Island, where she has a house in a fancy community called Watch Hill. It was raining, and the day looked like a bust, until her friend Jaime King’s husband came up with the idea to buy eight Slip ‘N Slides and lay them end to end like some unholy Slip ‘N Slide centipede. Even with the rain, the slides still weren’t slippery enough, so they got a bunch of olive oil and poured it all over themselves. (“There was a dangerous level of slipperiness,” Swift says.) Later they all went to the beach, which is normally full of Swift-gawkers (“Hotel fees have doubled in the year we’ve been there,” Swift says), but was empty that day because of the rain. That night they cooked a huge feast, with Swift assigning everyone jobs (“You make salad dressing! You chop apples for apple pie!”), and afterward they played Celebrity, the game where everyone puts a bunch of famous names in a hat and takes turns drawing one and trying to make their team guess. The game got a little heated, because one team had a lot more famous people on it, which gave them what some guests thought was an unfair advantage. (Swift: “It was like, ‘You dated him! 2010!'”) But in the end, everyone was appeased, and the game went on as planned. And did Swift’s team win? She smiles. “Of course we won.”\n\nSwift bought the Rhode Island house in April 2013, for a reported $17 million. The old summer estate of a Standard Oil heiress, it boasts water views in every room and a seagull Swift named George Washington that swims in her pool. Swift calls it her “dream house,” but it’s also been the source of some of her first truly negative press. The trouble started when she redid her sea wall, which she says hadn’t been updated since the house was built in 1929. She hired a team of engineers, who spent all winter rebuilding it; she thought she was doing something nice, until some locals got angry and accused her of ruining the beach. (TMZ: “Taylor Swift Neighbors Pissed: You’re Screwing With Our Coastline!!”)\n\n\nIt wasn’t long before the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council stepped in to say that Swift hadn’t done anything wrong. Still, for Swift, the wall became sort of a metaphor for haters in general. “There will always be people who grumble about things,” she says. “But when they saw what it looked like when it was finished – it looked so much nicer! The other wall had all this graffiti on it – it looked old, and not in a good way. But it was a problem, so I fixed it. Nothing has changed about anyone’s beach experience, except that now my house won’t fall on them. So, you know. Sorry not sorry.”\n\nThe only way to hear 1989 in full is to borrow Swift’s iPhone, which is white and silver and covered in kitten stickers. There are 13 songs in all, plus a handful of bonus tracks, filed under the unbreakable code name “Sailor Twips.” (She will only play them over headphones, because of wiretaps.) There are also hundreds of voice memos containing sketches of chords and melodies, which is how most of her songs start out. Antonoff (who also happens to be Dunham’s boyfriend) says that for one song they wrote together, he sent Swift a track “and literally 30 minutes later she sent me back a voice note that sounded exactly like the record.”\n\nAs the title suggests, 1989 was influenced by some of Swift’s favorite Eighties pop acts, including Phil Collins, Annie Lennox and “Like a Prayer”-era Madonna. (Given that 1989 is also the year Swift was born, she necessarily got into them later, usually via VH1’s Pop-Up Video.) The album was executive-produced by Swift and Max Martin, with whom she first collaborated on her 2012 single “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.” Officially, it’s not even finished yet: Somewhere in Sweden, Martin is tinkering until the very last minute to ensure the drum sounds are as up-to-date as possible.\n\n\ntaylor swift rolling stone cover\n\nSwift’s last album, 2012’s Red, straddled the line between country and pop. “But at a certain point,” she says, “if you chase two rabbits, you lose them both.” So this time, she set out to do full-on “blatant pop music.” A casual fan won’t notice much difference, but to Swift and her brand, it’s a big step. She says she won’t be going to country-awards shows or promoting the album on country radio. When she first turned in the record, she says the head of her label, Scott Borchetta, told her, “This is extraordinary – it’s the best album you’ve ever done. Can you just give me three country songs?”\n\n“Love you, mean it,” is how Swift characterizes her response. “But this is how it’s going to be.”\n\nThe other big change on 1989 is that for the first time in years, there are no diss tracks dishing about Swift’s exes. A few of the songs are about her relationships and love life, but they’re mostly wistful and nostalgic, not finger-pointy or score-settling. “Different phases of your life have different levels of deep, traumatizing heartbreak,” Swift says. “And in this period of my life, my heart was not irreparably broken. So it’s not as boy-centric of an album, because my life hasn’t been boycentric.” In fact, she suggests, she hasn’t dated at all since breaking up with One Direction singer Harry Styles more than a year and a half ago. “Like, have not gone on a date,” she says. “People are going to feel sorry for me when you write that. But it’s true.”\n\nSwift says dating is hard for her. For one thing, there’s the logistics. “Seventy percent of the time, when a guy asks me out, it’ll just be a random e-mail,” she says. Some movie star will get her address from his publicist and e-mail her cold. Usually she politely rebuffs them – but even if someone did penetrate that line of defense, building a relationship is hard.\n\n\n“I feel like watching my dating life has become a bit of a national pastime,” Swift says. “And I’m just not comfortable providing that kind of entertainment anymore. I don’t like seeing slide shows of guys I’ve apparently dated. I don’t like giving comedians the opportunity to make jokes about me at awards shows. I don’t like it when headlines read ‘Careful, Bro, She’ll Write a Song About You,’ because it trivializes my work. And most of all, I don’t like how all these factors add up to build the pressure so high in a new relationship that it gets snuffed out before it even has a chance to start. And so,” she says, “I just don’t date.”\n\n(That goes for hooking up as well. “I just think it’s pointless if you’re not in love,” Swift says. “And I don’t have the energy to be in love right now. So, no.”)\n\nTruth be told, Swift sounds a tiny bit jaded – which, for a “self-professed hopeless romantic,” maybe isn’t the worst thing to be. “It’s not like I’ve sworn off love,” she says. “My life is just not conducive to bringing other people into it right now. I’m very childlike and romantic about lots of things, but I’m realistic about this.”\n\nSwift pauses, searching for a metaphor that will help her explain herself. “Have you heard of the Loneliest Whale? There’s this whale – I think Adrian Grenier is making a documentary about it. It swims through the ocean, and it has a call unlike any other whale’s. So it doesn’t have anyone to swim with. And everybody feels so sorry for this whale – but what if this whale is having a great time? Because it’s not bad that I’m not hopelessly in love with someone. It’s not a tragedy, and it’s not me giving up and being a spinster. Although I did get another cat.” She laughs. “I asked around: I was like, ‘Does two cats count as cats?’ But then I thought, what imaginary guy’s perspective am I thinking about this from? Someone is going to think I’m undateable for a lot of reasons before they think I’m undateable because I have two cats.”\n\nSince she’s been single, Swift has been acquiring girlfriends with the fervor she once devoted to landing guys. (For instance: Two years ago she told Vogue she wanted to be friends with Kloss; now they’re going to the gym together and taking road trips to Big Sur.) Swift says this is another byproduct of being single. “When your number-one priority is getting a boyfriend, you’re more inclined to see a beautiful girl and think, ‘Oh, she’s gonna get that hot guy I wish I was dating,'” she says. “But when you’re not boyfriend-shopping, you’re able to step back and see other girls who are killing it and think, ‘God, I want to be around her.'” As an example, she cites her pal Lorde, whom she calls Ella. “It’s like this blazing bonfire,” Swift says. “You can either be afraid of it because it’s so powerful and strong, or you can go stand near it, because it’s fun and it makes you brighter.”\n\n\nEarlier in her career, Swift deflected questions about feminism because she didn’t want to alienate male fans. But these days, she’s proud to identify herself as a feminist. To her, all feminism means is wanting women to have the same opportunities as men. “I don’t see how you could oppose that.” Dunham says Swift has always been a feminist whether she called herself one or not: “She runs her own company, she’s creating music that connects to other women instead of creating a sexual persona for the male gaze, and no one is in control of her. If that’s not feminism, what is?”\n\nSwift’s focus on sisterhood cuts both ways, because when another woman crosses her, she’s equally fierce about hitting back. The angriest song on 1989 is called “Bad Blood,” and it’s about another female artist Swift declines to name. “For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not,” she says. “She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, ‘Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?'” Then last year, the other star crossed a line. “She did something so horrible,” Swift says. “I was like, ‘Oh, we’re just straight-up enemies.’ And it wasn’t even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I’m surprisingly non-confrontational – you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It’s awkward, and I don’t like it.”\n\n(Pressed, Swift admits there might have been a personal element to the conflict. “But I don’t think there would be any personal problem if she weren’t competitive,” she says.)\n\n\ntaylor swift rolling stone cover\n\nAs is often the case, Swift dealt with her emotions by writing about them. “Sometimes the lines in a song are lines you wish you could text-message somebody in real life,” she says. “I would just be constantly writing all these zingers – like, ‘Burn. That would really get her.’ And I know people are going to obsess over who it’s about, because they think they have all my relationships mapped out. But there’s a reason there are not any overt call-outs in that song. My intent was not to create some gossip-fest. I wanted people to apply it to a situation where they felt betrayed in their own lives.”\n\nSwift prides herself on never explicitly saying whom her songs are about, and she’s not going to start with this one. Yes, she sprinkles clues in her liner notes and makes winking references onstage, but she tries to keep them obscure enough to maintain some modicum of mystery (or at least plausible deniability). She’s so disciplined on this front that she won’t even say any of her ex-boyfriends’ names out loud – so when she does slip up, even in the most innocent way possible, it’s highly entertaining.\n\nSwift is still talking about “Bad Blood” when she starts to explain why she wants everyone to know it’s about a female. “I know people will make it this big girl-fight thing,” she says. “But I just want people to know it’s not about a guy. You don’t want to shade someone you used to date and make it seem like you hate him, when that’s not the case. And I knew people would immediately be going in one direction—” As she suddenly realizes that she just accidentally referenced her ex-boyfriend’s band, Swift goes white. She buries her face in her hands. “Why?!” she howls, cracking up. It’s a classic Taylor Swift Surprised Face, only for real this time.\n\nSwift won’t say much about her relationship with Styles, other than that they’re now friends. But talking to her, it seems clear that many of the songs on 1989 that are about a guy are about him. There’s “I Wish You Would,” about an ex who bought a house two blocks from hers (whom she implies was Styles). And “All You Had to Do Was Stay,” about a guy who was never willing to commit (ditto). Then there’s the song that sets a new high-water mark for Swiftian faux secrecy – a sexy Miami Vice-sounding throwback about a guy with slicked-back hair and a white T-shirt and a girl in a tight little skirt that is called – no joke – “Style.” (She allows herself a satisfied grin. “We should have just called it ‘I’m Not Even Sorry.'”)\n\n\nOf all the songs on the album that seem to be about Styles, the most intriguing one is “Out of the Woods.” Co-written by Antonoff, it’s a frantic tale of a relationship where, Swift says, “every day was a struggle. Forget making plans for life – we were just trying to make it to next week.” The most interesting part comes when Swift sings, “Remember when you hit the brakes too soon/Twenty stitches in a hospital room.” She says it was inspired by a snowmobile ride with an ex who lost control and wrecked it so badly that she saw her life flash before her eyes. Both of them had to go to the ER, although Swift wasn’t hurt. She corrects herself: “Not as hurt.”\n\nFor a couple whose every move was so thoroughly documented, it’s kind of shocking to think that something as newsworthy as a trip to the emergency room wouldn’t have wound up on the Internet. “You know what I’ve found works even better than an NDA?” says Swift. “Looking someone in the eye and saying, ‘Please don’t tell anyone about this.'” Even so, it’s impressive: The most top-secret hospital visit would necessarily involve three or four witnesses – and none of them talked?\n\nSwift says that’s sort of her point. “People think they know the whole narrative of my life,” she says. “I think maybe that line is there to remind people that there are really big things they don’t know about.”\n\n\nI didn’t know what kind of coffee you wanted, so I brought options.”\n\nTwo weeks later, Swift is in the back seat of an SUV idling next to Central Park, with a tray of four iced coffees balanced on her lap. Outside wait a dozen paparazzi and several dozen fans. The plan is to take a nice walk in the park – and maybe, though this is unspoken, to get a glimpse of the attention she faces daily.\n\nSwift takes her bodyguard’s hand and steps out of the car. She’s dressed in the decidedly un-park-friendly outfit of a tweed skirt and crop top, pink suede Louboutin pumps, and a yellow Dolce & Gabbana bag. She navigates the muddy trail impressively in her heels, the crowd behind her swelling every few feet. In front of her, two bodyguards clear a path. Behind her, another bodyguard carries a bag of scones.\n\nSwift turns down a dead-end path where the paparazzi can’t follow and takes a seat in a gazebo on the shores of the lake. On the wooden posts are carved hundreds of initials, the stories of couples who came before – the kind of thing that might appear in a Taylor Swift song. Excitedly, Swift points at the lake: “Turtles! And ducks!” She looks at the ground. “Oh. And a used condom.”\n\nSwift says that the only time she could come to the park and have it be normal would be in the middle of the night (“which is dangerous”) or at four in the morning (“which is early”). She hasn’t driven alone in five years, and she can’t leave her home without being swarmed by fans. (“When a sweet little 12-year-old says to their mom, ‘Taylor lives an hour from here . . .’ – more times than not, they’ll make the trip.”) Although she doesn’t like to draw attention to it, she says there is a contingent of fans that think her songs contain hidden messages to them. “Think about it,” she says. “Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone? Take that, add ‘crazytown’ to it, and it sounds like an invitation for kidnapping.”\n\ntaylor swift rolling stone cover\n\n\nWe’ve been talking for a while when a boat rows up carrying three teenagers – two girls and a guy. “Oh, my God!” says one of the girls. “Today is my birthday! Can I please take a picture with you?” Swift laughs. “You can, but I don’t know how you’re going to. You’re on a boat, buddy!”\n\n“I’ll get off!” the girl says. “I’ll find a way.” Swift and her bodyguard reach out and help her into the pavilion. “You’re going to make me cry!” she says.\n\n“Is it really your birthday?” Swift asks.\n\n“How old are you?”\n\n“Seventeen,” the girl says.\n\n“Oh, that’s a good year.”\n\n“I know. I’m excited.”\n\nThe girl says she lives on Long Island. She and her friends took the train in for the day. “That’s cute,” Swift says. “Are you going to dinner somewhere?”\n\nThe girl scrunches up her face. “We were going to . . . Chipotle?”\n\nSwift smiles. She goes to her purse and pulls out a wad of cash – $90, to be exact. “Here,” she says. “Go somewhere nice.”\n\n“Oh, my God,” the girl says. “Thank you!” She climbs back in the boat, and she and her friends paddle off.\n\nPretty soon it’s time to go. One of Swift’s bodyguards, Jeff, a former Marine Corps anti-terrorism specialist, comes over to brief her. “OK, we’ve got a six-minute walk to the exit. Twitter is going like wildfire, so some of the more obsessive fans . . .” He trails off. “We’re just gonna close the gap on you and keep them back.”\n\nSwift gives her bangs one last check in her phone’s camera, then she looks out at the lake. “I wish we had a boat.”\n\nShe stands up to go. Immediately we’re surrounded by a crush of paparazzi and fans. Even the hot-dog vendors are snapping pictures. As Swift winds her way through the park, the crowd grows larger and more aggressive; it’s a little scary. “OK, everybody, we need some room, please!” Jeff says. “Step back. Give her space!”\n\nBut Swift is unfazed. “You want to know a trick to immediately go from feeling victimized to feeling awesome?” she says. She pulls out her phone and hands me the earbuds: “This is my go-to.” She presses play, and Kendrick Lamar’s “Backseat Freestyle” fills the speakers. As Swift bobs her head, Lamar raps:\n\n\nAll my life I want money and power\nRespect my mind or die from lead shower\nI pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower\nSo I can fuck the world for 72 hours\nGoddamn, I feel amazing\nDamn, I’m in the Matrix . . .\n\nSwift smiles wide. “I know every word.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Rolling Stone: 22 Things You Learn Hanging Out With Taylor Swift\nFrom why she doesn't take sexy selfies to why she dances at awards shows, here's what didn't fit into her third Rolling Stone cover story\n\nWe followed Taylor Swift for days, getting all the details on her pop coming-out party, 1989 — and learned a little about living under the constant eye of the paparazzi to boot. Here's 22 facts from the co-author of \"22\" that couldn't fit into this issue's cover story, from why Lena Dunham thinks she's a little bit like a 90-year-old to why it's impossible to keep a steady romantic relationship.\nShe has money in her blood.\nSwift's mom, Andrea, was working as a mutual-fund wholesaler in Philadelphia when she met Swift's dad, Scott, who was a client. \"They met in a meeting, and he asked her out,\" Swift says. \"He had this farm 40 minutes outside of Philly, and he was throwing this big hoedown, and she came, and that's where they fell in love.\" As a girl, Swift wanted to be a stockbroker like her dad; she and her brother also took sailing and horseback riding lessons — \"just in case we were put in a time machine and had to live in the 1800s.\"\nShe used to get drunk and cry about Joni Mitchell.\n\"When I first started drinking — when I was like 21 — I used to cry about Joni Mitchell all the time after a few glasses of wine,\" Swift says. \"All my friends would know, once I started crying about Joni Mitchell, it was time for me to go to bed.\"\nShe actually does curse from time to time.\nAlthough Swift has cultivated a pretty G-rated image, in private she's just like anyone else. At one point she's playing some rough demos of a few new songs on her iPhone when she pulls up one called \"I Know Places,\" co-written with Ryan Tedder. Swift is playing the piano and hits a wrong note when she blurts out, \"Fuck!\" Blushing, the real-life Swift immediately attempts to cover the speaker on her phone.\nShe co-wrote Lena Dunham's future wedding song.\nAs a bonus track on her new album, 1989, Swift co-wrote a song with Jack Antonoff of fun., who happens to be her pal Lena Dunham's boyfriend. It's called \"You Are Love,\" and Antonoff describes it as having \"a very 'Secret Garden' Springsteen vibe.\" According to Dunham: \"Jack and I have a lot of existential and political issues with marriage. But if we ever do get married, there's no fucking way Taylor is not playing that song.\"\nShe lives in the house Frodo Baggins built.\nEarlier this year, Swift moved to Manhattan, where she bought a pair of adjoining Tribeca apartments for a reported $20 million. The building dates back to 1882, when it was built as a warehouse for a sausage dealer — she likes the way it feels like a farmhouse in the city, with lots of wood beams and exposed brick. The apartment was previously owned byLord of the Rings director Peter Jackson, but Swift says she didn't have to change very much. (\"They have really great taste in paint colors.\") She did, however, find a new use for one walk-in closet: \"Now it's my greeting-card writing room!\"\nShe's surprisingly proud of being able to do splits.\nHanging on the wall in Swift's new apartment — near dozens of Polaroids of Swift's family and friends — is a photo of her doing splits. \"I was the kid in elementary school who could never do them,\" she explains. \"So it was a big goal of mine.\" In order to pull it off, she spent four months stretching every single day. \"It was really hard and painful,\" she says. \"No one could understand why it was so important to me.\" But in the end, it was all worth it. As she says: \"Take that, elementary school insecurities.\"\nShe took her grandma's style.\nAlso hanging in Swift's apartment is a photo of her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, an opera singer in the Fifties who was a dead ringer for Swift. \"I've taken after her in ways I really didn't see coming,\" Swift says. \"We have the same nose. We both like to dress up. And she loved to entertain: At her parties, she would get up and sing for her friends.\" Her grandma also took Swift to see her first musical, a children's production of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, when she was 10. \"I started doing kids' musicals, because I loved seeing these kids up there singing and acting,\" she recalls. \"It affected me more than I realized.\"\nDon't expect to see her at the club anytime soon.\nSwift's idea of a big Saturday night is watching Titanic at home with her cats. \"We're both a little bit like 90-year-olds,\" says Lena Dunham. \"If we're feeling really crazy, I can get her to go to a furniture store.\"\nDespite the rumors, Swift says she and Selena Gomez never had beef.\nLast August, the gossip press reported that Swift and her pal Gomez weren't on speaking terms because of the latter's involvement with Justin Bieber. Not true, says Swift. \"People think they have my relationships all mapped out. There were all these blogs, like, 'Are they feuding? Are they fighting?' Meanwhile Selena and I would be on the phone that night, laughing about it. We let them have that one.\"\nShe's not a fan of sexy selfies — or of flaunting it in general.\n\"I don't Instagram pictures of myself for people to be like 'Wow, that looks really sexy,'\" she says. \"I take pictures of cute kittens, or when the ocean looks nice, or of a funny sign I saw in an airport.\" This philosophy extends to sexiness IRL as well: \"I like a more classic look,\" she says. \"I always go back to Audrey Hepburn and Grace Kelly. Red lipstick and a winged eyeliner — I think that looks nice.\"\nShe has a simple trick for surviving the paparazzi.\nWhen it comes to the paps, Swift has two simple rules. \"You just make sure your skirt is down, and you make sure you don't give them a terrible eating shot,\" she says. The second one is hard for her: \"I'm incapable of telling when food is on my face. It's like I don't have nerves in my skin. So if I get, like, a heinous piece of chocolate on my face, please let me know. I won't be offended.\"\nIf you ever spot her in public, go ahead ask for a picture.\n\"I'm totally cool with human interaction,\" says Swift. \"I'm not scared of strangers. I don't walk around with bags over my head.\" All she asks is that you come up and ask, instead of trying for a sneak pic. \"Everyone always says the same thing when they get called out: 'I was not!'\" she laughs. \"But it's like, yeah, you definitely were! As a human being who's been dealing with this for eight years, I know when someone is taking a picture of me.\"\nShe's a very thoughtful gift-giver.\n\"The amount of baked goods and needlepoints I've gotten from Taylor cannot be counted,\" reports Jack Antonoff. She's baked him multiple batches of cookies (including pumpkin and oatmeal raisin), and she's made Dunham a button collage and a cross-stitch of a cat. She was also the first person to give the couple a housewarming present when they moved into their new apartment. It was a taxidermied moth.\nBut she's never ordered anything from Amazon.\n\"I've never ordered anything from Amazon. But my brother does all the time.\"\nShe's grown a little disillusioned with love.\nThere's a song on the new album called \"Wildest Dreams,\" in which Swift takes a fatalist view of romance. \"I think the way I used to approach relationships was very idealistic,\" she says. \"I used to go into them thinking, 'Maybe this is the one — we'll get married and have a family, this could be forever.' Whereas now I go in thinking, 'How long do we have on the clock — before something comes along and puts a wrench in it, or your publicist calls and says this isn't a good idea?'\"\nAnd she says it's almost impossible for her to maintain a relationship.\nWhen it comes to dating when you're a celebrity, Swift says, \"you do feel a little bit like you got run over by a truck. You'll be riding in the car with someone and all of a sudden it comes on the radio that he bought you a diamond ring and he's going to propose. And you look at him and go, '...that's not true, right?' And he says, 'No that's not true!' Can you blame me for wanting less of that?\"\nWhen it comes to breaking up, Swift is a rip-off-the-Band-Aid type.\n\"Once you've established that someone doesn't belong in your life, I don't understand what more there is to talk about,\" she says. \"I walk away from things when they're bad. I don't stick around to watch them burn to the ground.\" She says when she decides a relationship has \"become toxic,\" \"I'll just check out. Stop communication. I don't want to scream and yell at someone and give them the opportunity to say I'm crazy, or that I went psycho,\" she says. \"No one will ever be able to say I went psycho on them.\"\nAlthough she's had plenty to say about her exes, she's not sure what they'd say about her.\n\"If you turn on a tape recorder, they'd say nice things,\" she says. \"But you never know what they'd say in a regular conversation.\"\nShe's never been in love.\n\"Looking back? Not real love. Not the kind that lasts. I think that's still ahead of me — which is really exciting.\"\nShe gets very excited about animals.\nDuring one afternoon spent walking in Central Park, Swift freaks out about animals at least four times. First comes an encounter with some snapping turtles, whom she wants to feed but can't. (\"I'll get in trouble with PETA.\") Then there's a bumblebee that tries to land on her head. (\"Have you ever gotten stung by a bee? I can't remember if you're supposed to stay still or keep moving.\") A little while later, she spots some ducks in a pond. (\"Ducks!\" she says. \"Are those babies, or are they teenagers?\") And finally, there's the appearance of a quintessentially New York rodent. \"A mouse!\" she squeals happily, before being informed that it's actually a rat. Swift laughs: \"Do you feel like you're hanging out with a six-year-old a little bit?\" \nSpeaking of age: She knows she sometimes comes off like a 24-year-old tween.\n\"I think there's an interesting lag-time on emotional growth for me,\" Swift says. \"Because I write my records a couple of years before I put them out, I've always seemed two or three years younger than I actually was.\" That said, having gotten famous singing about fairy tales and crushes, she wary of growing up too fast, because \"there's always gonna be an eight-year-old in the front row. Always.\"\nBesides — she likes feeling like a little kid sometimes\n\"I think you have to do things that make you geek out like you're a kid again, or else you just become one of these 45-year-old 24-year-olds,\" Swift says. \"That's why I dance like I'm having fun at awards shows, even though no one else is. Because being cool usually means being bored by everything. And I'm not bored by any of this.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Most fresh-faced actresses are hungry for the biggest part they can nab. Taylor Swift would only accept the smallest. The fact that it's so tiny is what drew me to it,\" the star, 24, tells Us of her role as supernaturally gifted student Rosemary in the sci-fi funtasy The Giver (in theaters now). \"I didn't want to bite off more than I could chew with a leading role just yet.\"\nBesides, Swift-whose prior screen credits include a bit part in the 2010 rom- com Valentine's Day and cameos in TV's New Girl and CSI-has a day job. As she explains, \"I only had so much time because I'm so busy with my music. So to take a week off to film in South Africa last October and learn what it's like to be on a film set was a dream scenario.\" \nSwift (Psst! She's been hinting online that her fifth album may be on the way) shares more fond memories exclusively with Us.\n\nQ: The film is based on a popular dystopian YA novel. Is that why you signed on?\nA: Oh, yeah. The Giver had a huge impact on me when I was in school. It made me think about how strange it is that intense pain is usually balanced out by intense joy obviously a theme I explore in music. \nQ: And there's another selling point: You're in a movie with Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridgest \nA: Um, definitely! Even get- ting to meet Jeff Bridges is a crazy thought for me! And actually getting to be in the scene with him was so far above and beyond what I could expect for what's essentially my first role in a major movie.\nQ: You must have been so nervous during filming.\nA: To be honest, I was so jet-lagged that my entire time on set slipped away and the days would fade into each other. But the numer ous breaks in between takes were the best. Jeff and I held jam sessions in his dressing room with his drums, guitars and keyboard. We'd play, then everybody joined in whether they knew the song or not.\nQ: You didn't have any scenes with Katie Holmes, but did you get to bond with her at all? \nA: Yep, we had a girls' day! I went over and hung out with Katie and her daughter, Suri. We had our nails done, ate sushi and talked about what our lives are like and everything else that girlfriends talk about.\nQ: Not bad for a rookie. Does that mean more acting is in your future?\nA: I don't know. That has yet to be determined. I seem to be changing so much and so quickly these days that it is hard to rule out anything. I never thought that I'd live in New York or even cut my hair. These are all things that changed recently, and it is really funny and interesting how life keeps you on your toes. I would never say I'd never do another movie, but then again, I know I'm going to be touring for the next two years pretty soon and I'm so excited about that I can barely function!",

      "Transcript/Content": "Swift Collaboration: Liz Rose Reveals Secrets Behind Taylor's Early Hits\nWhen Taylor Swift was first rising to stardom, and even for a few years afterward, there were a lot of naysayers who refused to believe a girl that young had that kind of songwriting talent. They looked at the credits on her albums and came to an easy conclusion: Clearly, Liz Rose, her decades-older co-writer, was the genius behind the throne.\n\"I know,\" says Rose now, remembering the time when Taylor haters were jumping to give her all the credit. \"Look at those lyrics. Those are the lyrics of a 13-, 14-, 15-, 16-, 17-, 18-year-old. We certainly weren't writing 50-year-old Liz Rose songs — or 40-year-old, or however old I was then. I don't think like that! It's so funny to me that people could imagine that.\"\n\nBut there's no mistaking what an integral role Rose played in Swift's early success. The Music Row stalwart co-wrote seven of the songs on the singer's 2006 debut album, including her breakout singles, \"Tim McGraw\" and \"Teardrops on My Guitar.\" For the follow-up, Fearless, released two years later, Rose collaborated on four songs, including the title track, \"White Horse,\" and arguably one of the greatest pop singles of all time, \"You Belong With Me.\"\nSuddenly, a then-fortysomething mom improbably found herself as the voice of tween and teen America. Or, to be more accurate, its channeler.\n\nRose could hardly be humbler when she describes how her co-writing with Swift has worked. She's willing to accept far more credit when it comes to the other collaborations that have led to hit singles — such as \"Crazy Girl,\" the No. 1 country hit for the Eli Young Band that won her an ACM Award last year for Song of the Year. When it comes to Swift, Rose swears that the ideas always sprang directly from the then-curly head of the young star, and that her primary function was to act as a conduit.\n\n\"The reason it worked is that I didn't get in her way,\" Rose says. \"With Taylor, it really was editing. That's never anything that she said — that's just how it was! At some point I wondered if I was selling myself short by saying that, because songwriting is songwriting. But with her, that's really what I do, and it's unlike the way I've written with anybody else before or since. A lot of it with Taylor was editing and moving this there and saying, 'Well, what if we said it like this?' I can remember times when I would try and throw out an idea for a new song: 'How about we write this?' And she would just go, 'Yeah, I don't think so. Go and write that with somebody else.' Because Taylor always wanted to write her songs. And there was always so much going on in her brain, you just had to help her get it out and get it down. She always has a reason behind why she's writing something. She's lived it or felt it. She's not making it up.\"\nRose's favorite of the songs they wrote together was the last one they did, \"All Too Well,\" which appeared on 2012's Red… a sad ballad that is widely believed to memorialize Swift's romance with Jake Gyllenhaal. \"There is a very raw emotion in 'All Too Well' that still hits me when I hear it. With that song, when we got together, she had it all in her brain, and it was probably 10, 12, or 15 minutes long! She had a story to get out, so we just sat down and started going through it piece by piece, and as she sang all these things, I just wrote down what I thought were the important pieces that hit.\" (Maybe when Swift is Rose's age, we can get a boxed-set reissue of Red that includes the unexpurgated eight-verse version.)\n\nSwift was 13 when she first approached Rose after a songwriters' showcase and asked if they could write together. At that point, Rose had just had a hit with Gary Allan's \"Songs About Rain,\" and could have been more discriminating than to agree to sit down with someone who not only didn't have any record deal but, barely being out of puberty, seemed to have an infinitesimal chance of ever getting one. On top of that, as soon as they started writing together, it became clear they were coming up with songs that no one else could ever record but Swift herself.\n\n\"Tim McGraw\" was one of the first tunes they ever wrote together, and Rose remembers thinking to herself: \"Nobody [else] is going to ever cut this song!\" But, she explains, \"We were just writing a song. I don't even think we thought that song was gonna make the record. We never even demoed that song. I believe that she played it live for Scott [Borchetta, the head of Big Machine Records], and he said, 'Why are we not cutting that song?'\"\nThe fact that their songs were un-pitchable to anyone else in Nashville is part-and-parcel with what made Swift a superstar. \"I never wrote with Taylor thinking that we were going to pitch the song. I always knew that we were writing Taylor songs. She really has her own way of saying things. I meet a lot of young girls that think they can be Taylor if I help them out, and I have to say to them, 'These are Taylor's words. There was no magic fairy dust around me. Taylor knew how to write a song at 13. So you need to go figure out how to write your song first.'\"\n\nSo does every young girl coming to Nashville look Rose up now?\nShe laughs and sighs. \"You can't even imagine. And you know what? It's OK. If I have time, I will write with new people — guys and girls — because if we don't pay it forward and mentor these kids, that's silly. But I went through a thing where they were all obsessed with Taylor, and I would say, 'You know, there's only one Taylor Swift. If you can't write a song by yourself [before you come to me], I don't know what to tell you.' That's kind of what I send them to do. You know, Taylor opened so many doors, and it's unbelievable how she got so many young girls to pick up the guitar and write songs, and so we have to nurture these girls. But as far as there being another Taylor Swift, there's only one. Just like there's one Miranda [Lambert]. You've just got to encourage them to find their own path and their own voice.\"\n\nRose didn't write with Swift for her forthcoming album. \"I moved to Dallas for a couple of years, and she's been in Nashville and L.A. I think she was working with a lot of track guys\" — meaning beat-oriented producers like Max Martin. \"I don't know that anybody's even heard it. But whatever she's doing, I bet it's incredible, because she just continues to grow and get better.\"\n\nRose has her own publishing company with seven writers. When she's not running that, she's busy co-writing songs for the likes of Little Big Town (\"Sober,\" plus three songs on their upcoming album) or The Voice alum RaeLynn (the new \"God Made Girls\"). In that vein of songwriting, she gets to veritably vomit out all the lyrics she can and then rely on her co-writers to edit them — pretty much the reverse of what she does with Swift.\n\nShe's also opening a home décor store in the fall in Nashville with one of her daughters, Hayley, \"because I need one more thing to do, right? This satisfies my shopping bug. Now I just shop and (re)sell it.\"\n\nRose couldn't be prouder, meanwhile, of another daughter, Caitlin Rose, who's released a couple of critically acclaimed Americana albums and is working on another for 2015. Did Rose mentor her daughter? \"Oh, no!\" she exclaims, laughing, as if the thought of self-motivated Caitlin needing a push into music is as ridiculous as the thought of Taylor having required a gentle shove.\n\nHer one regularly scheduled writing stop is a weekend retreat she has every three months with Lori McKenna and Hillary Lindsey, with LBT's \"Sober\" having been the result of one of those sessions. Rose plans to enlist those gals when she records her own solo album later this year, which is something that is happening with a bit of reticence, she admits.\n\n\"My kids are going, 'Oh no! what are you doing? But it's really fun to pull my skeletons out of the closet and put 'em down on paper. I may get a bunch of the girls I've been writing songs with and figure out how to do a Liz Rose & Friends record. I don't know what I'll do with it, but it's just gonna be fun, and I'll get to embarrass my kids!\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Why Taylor Swift Welcomed You to New York\nOn the heels of her latest song, the beautiful artist tells us all about NYC living, the Nashville work ethic, and the binder full of men who have threatened to kill, kidnap, or marry her\n\nPublished in the November 2014 issue\n\nRaab meets the singer-songwriter for breakfast in downtown Manhattan a few days before her massive-hit single \"Shake It Off\" is released. She's coming from a promotional photo shoot for it, and after breakfast she'll head to L.A. to rehearse for the Video Music Awards later this afternoon. Her publicity manager and two bodyguards are seated at a table nearby. For Swift: scrambled eggs, no coffee.\n\nSCOTT RAAB: It's 8:30 A.M. and you've already been working for two hours?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: We were at the Empire State Building because we're shooting for the livestream on Monday. There will be a wide helicopter camera shot on the Empire State Building, and I will be up on the top platform waving. It's so exciting to unveil who you've been for the last two years. My life has changed drastically in the last year and a half.\n\n\nWe Recommend\nSR: Musically? Geographically?\n\nTS: Everything. I never thought I'd live in New York, because I thought I'd be too overwhelmed by how busy and bright and crazy the city is. Then all of a sudden, this year, all I wanted to do was live in New York. I never thought I would be so happy being completely unattached to anyone romantically.\n\nSR: Why do you think there's so much attention paid to your dating habits?\n\nTS: I think with every celebrity story there has to be a \"Yeah, but …\" Take Beyoncé: She's incredibly talented, gorgeous, perfect role model for girls, empowering women all over the world. Yeah, but … let's try to pick at her marriage. I think that every celebrity has that. And predominantly women, unfortunately.\n\nSR: You're judged constantly. Your private life is clickbait.\n\nTS: I would date someone, figure out we weren't compatible or figure out we didn't work out, and then we'd break up. That seems like a very normal thing for a young 20-something to do, and that is my biggest scandal. I think it's healthy for everyone to go a few years without dating, just because you need to get to know who you are. And I've done more thinking and examining and figuring out how to cope with things on my own than I would have if I had been focusing on someone else's emotions and someone else's schedule. It's been really good.\n\nSR: I think I was watching an Ellen clip—it might have been Chelsea Handler—and she's teasing you, and at one point you said, \"No one listens to me!\" And it wasn't that you were that aggravated, but it stuck in my head because I think that's true: No one's actually paying attention to the human there.\n\nTS: It doesn't seem like a possibility at this point in my life. What does seem possible and easy and comfortable is having this entire league of incredible girlfriends that I have. And I can trust them, and the reason I know I can trust them is because nothing true about me is being written in the press right now.\n\nSR: You knew what your passion was early. It must take an incredible amount of energy to sustain that passion.\n\nTS: I'm very busy, and I'm tired a lot. I was talking to [songwriter-producer] Ryan Tedder about this the other day, because we're both equal left- and right-brain people. So there's part of our brain that we shut off when we're in the studio. There's part of our brain that we turn on when we are out doing an interview or promoting something or waking up at six in the morning for hair and makeup. I think if that pressure came from other people, I would feel very weighed down by it. But the pressure comes from me, so I can't really say anything about it, because I'm the one saying to myself, You have to make a better album than you made last time. There is no other option. Otherwise, don't make an album.\n\nSR: I know that you have an infrastructure with family and all that, but do you ever feel like it's a runaway train?\n\nTS: No. The only thing I can't control is the spin in the press. And so if I know I can't control that, I have to let it go. In some ways, though, you can control it. I really didn't like the whole serial-dater thing. I thought it was a really sexist angle on my life. And so I just stopped dating people, because it meant a lot to me to set the record straight—that I do not need some guy around in order to get inspiration, in order to make a great record, in order to live my life, in order to feel okay about myself. And I wanted to show my fans the same thing.\n\nSR: You have your own jet?\n\nTS: Yeah, isn't that crazy?\n\nSR: You still do the meet-and-greets?\n\nTS: We do four before the show and one after.\n\nSR: That's country music, where it's not just about the songs.\n\nTS: Country music teaches you to work. You hear stories about these artists who show up four hours late to a photo shoot, and in Nashville that doesn't happen. In Nashville, if you go four hours late to a photo shoot, everyone leaves. In Nashville, if you don't care about radio and being kind to the people who are being good to you … It's a symbiotic relationship, and if you don't take care of it, then they won't take care of you. I've never been more proud to have come from a community that's so rooted in songwriting, so rooted in hard work and in treating people well. It was the best kind of training.\n\nSR: I've read about you writing thank-you notes to deejays.\n\nTS: I love writing thank-you notes. There's something very nostalgic to me about the feel of a card and putting pen to paper. How many times in our lives are we required to put pen to paper anymore?\n\nSR: I haven't written anyone a letter in years.\n\nTS: There's something romantic and sort of lost about it. I like things you can touch and things you can keep, because every bit of communication we have is ephemeral in nature. You can just delete an e-mail and it's like it was never there.\n\nSR: You seem utterly sane.\n\nTS: Thank you.\n\nSR: I mistrust that somehow.\n\nTS: You don't need to be cynical about it!\n\nSR: It's not you. It's my job.\n\nTS: That's what I don't like about celebrity culture and the obsession with it, and the takedown culture that we seem to be in. You have celebrities who are pushed to the brink of a public meltdown, and so the public thinks that every person in the public eye has dirty secrets that they're keeping, or isn't what they seem, or is masking it and faking sincerity, faking authenticity, faking being surprised at award shows when you win a Grammy.\n\nSR: There's a certain cruelty to it. When the meltdown does happen, people couldn't be more thrilled, especially if it's a young woman.\n\nTS: I'm not gonna let them make me have a meltdown. But, I think, as a songwriter you lose your edge if you find a way to protect yourself from everything they're going to say about you. You lose touch with what made you vulnerable enough to connect with people in your songwriting. And that's not something I wanna do. So it's all about walking a tightrope between not being so fragile and breakable that they can level you with one blow and being raw enough to feel it and write about it when you feel it. And it's not just a celebrity-takedown culture. It's a takedown culture. I know it when I see these kids—they're gonna get tortured socially until they find their calling in life.\n\nSR: You went through that kind of thing yourself in school.\n\nTS: I never felt like the kids in school were right about me when they'd say, \"She's weird. She's annoying. I don't want to hang out with her.\" I always remember writing in my journal, saying, I just have to keep writing songs. I just have to keep doing this and someday, maybe, this will be different for me. I just have to keep working.\n\nSR: They seem like nice guys, your bodyguards.\n\nTS: They're really nice. They're incredible.\n\nSR: I've never interviewed anyone who brought security.\n\nTS: I fought the idea of having security for a very long time, because I really value normalcy. I really do. I like to be able to take a drive by myself. Haven't done that in six years.\n\nSR: Even in Tennessee?\n\nTS: No, they have to be in a car behind me. Because just the sheer number of men we have in a file who have showed up at my house, showed up at my mom's house, threatened to either kill me, kidnap me, or marry me. This is the strange and sad part of my life that I try not to think about. I try to be lighthearted about it, because I don't ever want to be scared. I don't want to be walking down the street scared. And when I have security, I don't have to be scared.\n\nSR: Do you still have connections with human beings?\n\nTS: It's a social situation every time I go out, but if I know I can't deal with talking to people that day, I just don't go out. I just have to wake up in the morning and say, How am I feeling today? If someone asks for a picture, am I gonna feel imposed upon today because I'm dealing with my own stuff? Am I gonna take my own stuff out on some innocent 14-year-old today and be in a bad mood? Okay, maybe not … Maybe I won't leave the house. I try really hard not to take bad days out on other people. Because I will get asked for an autograph, and I will get asked for a picture, and there will be someone with their cell phone filming me at a restaurant. If I'm not in the mood for that, I just kind of stay in. And that's fine. Those days don't happen very often. I try really hard to keep it light. Joy, enthusiasm, excitement—those are sort of my chief attributes.\n\nSR: I read that you finished two years of high school in 12 months.\n\nTS: That was just the most practical way to do it.\n\nSR: But not everyone could do it.\n\nTS: My parents were very strict about education and hard work, from the time my brother and I were really little kids.\n\nSR: You and your family lived on a Christmas-tree farm? That's a unique place to grow up.\n\nTS: It was such a weird place to grow up. But it has cemented in me this unnatural level of excitement about fall and then the holiday season. My friends are so sick of me talking about autumn coming. They're like, \"What are you, an elf?\"\n\nSR: Who took care of the tree business?\n\nTS: My dad.\n\nSR: I thought he was a Merrill Lynch guy.\n\nTS: He'd tend to the farm as his hobby. He'd get up four hours early to go mow the fields on his tractor. We all had jobs. Mine was picking the praying-mantis pods off of the trees, collecting them so that the bugs wouldn't hatch inside people's houses.\n\nSR: How old were you?\n\nTS: From five to ten. The only reason that was my job was because I was too little to help lift trees.\n\nSR: You've mentioned your grandmother in past interviews. What kind of singing did she do?\n\nTS: She sang opera. She would sing in whatever city-opera production when my grandfather was working. He was an engineer and he would travel a lot, building bridges. She even was a cohost on this show called The Pan American Show, in Puerto Rico, and she was beautiful and graceful but spoke the worst Spanish you've ever heard. All the Spanish-speaking fans in Puerto Rico just loved her, because she was so brave about how terrible she was at speaking Spanish. She tried every night. And then she'd get up and sing, and, of course, it was the perfect, beautiful operatic voice. Gorgeous soprano.\n\n\nWe Recommend\nSR: Have you seen yourself in The Giver?\n\nTS: I saw the movie. It's hard for me to separate myself from myself. I just see me in a brown wig and I think, Oh, I look so weird there. Why does my face look so weird? Oh, I hate the sound of my voice. Music is the only thing that's ever fit me like that little black dress you wear every single time you go out. Other things fit me for certain seasons, but music is the only thing that I would wear all year round. [To her manager]Can I play him something? So this is the first single—this is about the most important lesson I've learned in the last couple of years. [\"Shake It Off\" plays through earbuds.] Well, that's that.\n\nSR: Nice. I think you're gonna be big.\n\nTS: Thank you!\n\nSR: You have a great sense of humor, but you keep it kind of hidden. It's self-effacing and a little sarcastic, but you use it very judiciously.\n\nTS: I think it's nice to have some tricks up your sleeve. Everybody sees every part of everything I do, and they all draw their own conclusions from it, so there has to be a little bit of you that people only get when they're in person with you.\n\nSR: Do you ever feel trapped in the persona of sweetness, innocence, purity?\n\nTS: No, because I'm realistic about the fact that millions of people don't have time in their day to maintain a complex profile of who I am. They're busy with their work and their kids and their husband or their boyfriend and their friends. They only have time to come up with about two or three adjectives to describe people in the public eye. And that's okay. As long as those three adjectives aren't train wreck, mess, terrible. I figure eventually, if you hang around long enough, people will see all sides of you.\n\nSR: More evidence of your sanity.\n\nTS: When I was a little kid, my friends were watching Disney Channel, but I was watchingBehind the Music. And I was drawing these conclusions, like the reason these people went off the rails is because they lost their level of self-awareness. They turned a blind eye to things they didn't want to see, and all of a sudden all they were seeing were their delusions of grandeur. And I never wanted to make that mistake in my life, regardless of what my career ended up being. I take away these kind of life lessons from that show.\n\nSR: You've thought about this.\n\nTS: I have a lot of time. That's all I do.",

      "Transcript/Content": "While Taylor Swift was busy on her pre-album launch media tour, we caught up with the singer to get her thoughts on taking time off, her favorite Music City eats, and the idea behind 1989's wildly popular debut single, 'Shake It Off.”\n\nDid you have any idea 'Shake It Off” was going to be such a huge hit right out the gate?\nOne of the main things Max [Martin] and I wanted to do when we went into the studio is to make something that didn't sound like anything either of us had ever done before. I hadn't played around with a horn section or Motown vibes, and neither had Max, so we built this song from the ground up, and it turned into this very obvious chorus. I couldn't believe it had never occurred to me to say, 'haters gonna hate, players gonna play, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake it off.”\nThe video took three days to shoot, but what was the process like to coordinate all those moving parts from concept to completion?\nWhen you're shooting a music video before a song is even out, I approach that with a very high level of paranoia because I've never done things like that before. I've always put out a song and then shot the video, like, two weeks later. So going into this, it was very much a mission and a project and a secret kind of hush-hush thing, so I had to know what director I wanted to work with right off the bat. There was no sending out the song and getting directors to write treatments. I knew I wanted to work with Mark Romanek. I knew that would be my dream guy, and if he could in any way clear his schedule or make some room or meet with me, I knew he would be the one I would want.\n\nSo I played him the song early, and after one listen, he said, 'I'm in. I want to be a part of this. This song is insane.” That was another really good indicator for the song for me. I was really excited when that was his reaction, because [Romanek] is very busy and has moved onto working more in film…and he hadn't really ever done an artist concept before. He's always thought of the concept and presented it to the artist, so this was a new working process for him. I told him that I wanted to make this song about a big, giant dance metaphorlike, 'how you dance is how you live your life”and this metaphor about fitting in and not fitting in but not caring if you don't fit in because eventually you'll find who you fit in with.\nWhat did you have to bribe them with to keep that a secret for so long?\nBasically, I just gave them a very, very long talk. And I asked them really nicely and somewhat desperately to please keep this secret for me, because I said it's the biggest secret I have right now. And it's all I have right now. 'Please don't tell anyone about this. You weren't here. You can scream it from the rooftops after this is over. But please, please be the exception. Be the one group of people in this day and age who can keep a secret.” And they went and did that.\nDo you ever take a day off?\nI'm one of those people who, in my mind, I classify it as 'a day off” if I just have five hours free. Because I don't like to feel overworked and I don't like to be one of those people who complains about how exhausting their job is. People who whine about that are, I think, statistically less fun to be around. You cannot live your life this way. I classify my days off as what other people consider workdays, but it keeps me sane, which I guess is the main goal at hand here.\nWe hear you tell a lot of people in New York what to do and eat in Nashville.\nMost of my friendsor even people I've met once at a partywill reach out and say, 'give me a Nashville guide.” Seth Meyers and I were just talking about that, and he emailed me asking me what to do. And, basically, I'll give this very comprehensive, broken down, organized guide: 'If you're looking for this type of experience, try this and this and this. If you're looking for shopping experience, go this, this, this. If you're looking to experience more of a touristy bar situation but if you're looking for sore of under-the-radar speakeasy type of situation, go here, here, here. If you're looking for this type of music, go here, or if you're looking for this type of music, go there.” So honestly, I could keep you on the phone for an hour telling you about my recommendations for where to go to in Nashville.”\nYou recently bought a place in Manhattan. Are we in danger of losing you to NYC anytime soon?\nI'm not anyone who can be anywhere permanently. Things get very, well, \"social\" when I'm in a place for more than three days. I'll go out to a restaurant in one of the cities I'm in, and all of a sudden there are lot of people around, lots of paparazzi on planes heading to where I am. I just sort of have to, at this point in my life, hop around, which I'm comfortable with doing. I don't really have any reason not to hop around right now.\nWhat Nashville restaurants are you loving?\nI stick to the things that are old favorites for me. I love ordering sushi from Virago, I love Fido and the Hillsboro Village area. I love 12 Southeverybody loves 12 Southbut there's also something good there. For me, when I'm in Nashville, I do a lot of cooking and a lot of ordering in now, because usually I just want to spend time with my mom and dad. Oh! The Silly Goose is another one that I always order from.\nYou have a bit milestone birthdayyour 25thcoming up in December. Any plans for that?\nI think I'm scheduled to be on a transatlantic flight on my birthday. That kind of says everything, doesn't it? I should probably think of something to do other than a big TV performance in the UK. But I think that I go into game time mode [when launching an album]I have a birthday every year, but I don't get to promote a record every year.\nSo really, this entire fall is like your ongoing birthday party.\nYeah, I'm just really excited about this entire seasonthis fall and this winter.\n\nTaylor Swift\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch more with Taylor in the October issue of Nashville Lifestyles Magazine!",
      "Notes/Content": "\"I’ve gone and done it. I’ve interviewed my idol, reached the pinnacle of my career, and now I must retire. Given the nature of what I do and my Nashville locale, it was bound to happen eventually.\n\nPerhaps I’m being a *tad* bit dramatic but I did get to talk to the country-turned-pop star for a half an hour on the phone a couple months back for the October cover story for Nashville. And it was glorious. She was smart. Witty. Personable. Professional. All the things I’ve envisioned TSwift to be since I became obsessed started following her career long ago.\"",

Shake it up.\n\n“The last couple of years have been about defining life on my own terms,” the singer, 24, tells PEOPLE in this week’s 40th Anniversary issue.\n\nThe superstar, whose evolving style previously nabbed her the top spot on PEOPLE’s Best Dressed list, pays homage to the magazine’s history on this week’s cover with a pose that echoes Mia Farrow’s iconic Great Gatsby look from the inaugural issue in 1974.\n\n“Being on my own, prioritizing my girlfriends, my family and my music above everything else and trying things I never thought I’d try,” Swift says of the personal changes she has made. “It’s really been a liberating and freeing time.”\n\nIn a candid interview during a London stop on the press tour for her new album 1989 (pre-order it now here), the Grammy winner opens up about replacing headlines about boyfriends and breakups with a new focus on her chart-topping career – including her smash single, “Shake It Off.”\n\n“I made the decision to spend time on my own and figure out who I am,” she says of embracing the single life.\n\n“When you take the other person out of the scenario and you’re walking through life on your own, you end up figuring out what you actually like without anyone else’s input.”\n\nWith her cats Meredith and Olivia Benson – and an inner circle of ambitious, multi-talented friends that includes Girls star and author Lena Dunham, singer Lorde and actress Jaime King – she’s in no rush to find a guy.\n\nTIMELINE: People Magazine’s 40th Anniversary: Stars, Scandals & Celebrations\n\n“I’m not too worried about whether I meet someone,” she says. “I’m going to be happy either way.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] TAYLOR 2.0\nWith a new album at the top of the charts, the 25-year-old singer-songwriter welcomes Leigh Belz Ray into her Nashville apartment to talk about music, style and, yes, love.\nPHOTOGRAPHED BY MATT IRWIN FASHION BY KATE YOUNG\n\nDo I put down the cat?\nThis is the question that swirls in my head as I stand in Taylor Swift's kitchen with her four- month-old Scottish Fold kitten, Olivia Benson, nestled in my forearm.\nI find myself in this situation no more than five minutes after walking in the door to her downtown Nashville duplex apartment, and the flurry of activity around me is both amazing and paralyzing. While I'm idling, Swift is expertly unpacking the numerous takeout cartons of dinner that have just arrived from local grill J. Alexander's.\nThe only proper, mannered thing to do would be to help her move the food (Fish tacos! Barbecued salmon! Breaded trout! Dill salmon! Caesar salads! Enough to feed a family of eight!) to the large antique wooden dining table. Or put out the plates. Or grab napkins. Something.\nBut I've got a famous and unbelievably delicate creature snug- gled into the crook of my elbow, and it feels like prematurely end- ing the bonding moment is also, somehow, impolite. It's a can't-win. After three minutes of indecision, I gently deposit wee Olivia onto the pillow-laden couch, wash up and fold some paper towels into napkins to at least appear part of the meal that's taking shape.\nSwift is wearing a matching dark floral top and shorts from Aqua and pointy nude flats. Her shoulder-length hair is wavy and loose, her nails are bare and her eyes reveal just a hint of shadow, \"When I'm not working, a lot of the time I just put on tinted moisturizer and mascara,\" she says, before giving me the ultimate girl-to-girl compliment: \"And today I put on eyeshadow for you.\"\nAs a hostess, she's a natural. It's as if whatever it took to get me through her front door was a good-enough background check. (Obviously, as she's the kind of person who'll offer her cat without reservation.) Olivia Benson, whom Swift affectionately calls Dibbles, is everything Swift's Instagram will have you believe. \"If Olivia were a person,\" Swift later says, \"she'd come in and hug you and say, with a shrug of her shoulders, 'Sorry... I'm a hugger.\"\n\nMeredith, her two-year-old Scottish Fold, is here too. But her personality is more reserved. She keeps her distance. Olivia worships her owner, following the singer around as she gives a tour of her apartment, pressing her face against the glass window when we walk out on the balcony and, most adorably, sticking her head through a second-floor railing when Swift and I are sitting in the golden birdcage suspended over the living room.\nOh, I haven't mentioned the golden birdcage yet? Well, really, I should probably take a step back and tell you about the koi pond. In the middle of Swift's living room is a sizable stone-edged pond with a trickling fountain that gives the whole apartment a relaxed, spa-like feel. (The Bon Iver music playing in the background only intensifies that dreamy feeling.) Thirteen koi of different sizes live in this pond. Above a section of the water is a clear glass platform from which a wrought-iron spiral staircase ascends, leading to a gilded human-size birdeage, which is, of course, filled with soft pillows in rich jewel tones.\nThat these features fit right in with the rest of the apartment is a testament to the specificity and aes thetie cohesiveness of the design. Every inch of the place is covered with some color, texture, photo- graph or finish. Everything. In Swift's words, it's \"a cozy lair.\" She bought it when she was 18 and renovated for two years. She says she dreamed it all up, from the barn wood floors to the Tibetan clouds painted on the ceiling. As we sit in the birdcage, she proudly points up to a tiny nozzle: \"Look, it even has a sprinkler in case it catches on fire. Everything to regulation!\"\nThe photos on the walls are mostly from 2010, when she was just finishing renovations. They feel almost like the candids you'd see in a high school yearbook-smiley group shots with her friends and live-performance photos.\nThe year 2010 feels like a very long time ago to the Grammy winner.\nShe compares hearing her early songs to looking through an old photo album. \"I have mixed emotions when I'm listening to the music on my first record,\" she says. \"I had very different ideas about love, about my future, about what I was meant for. Breakups. All of it. I approach everything differently now-but I'm glad that I have those reference points in my life to look back on and go, Wow, I really used to think that happily ever after was a thing!\"\nShe keeps going, but I stop her. Does she not think happily ever after is a thing anymore? \"Not in those simple, plain terms,\" she replies. \"I think that no matter what you find in terms of happiness and compatibility, there's always going to be a struggle attached to it. I used to believe that you find the one and that's it: Nothing's difficult after that.\" She pauses. \"But then again, I know nothing now. I know legitimately nothing about lasting relationship experiences because I don't have them.\" Her feelings on love are matter-of-fact-almost unemotional: the kind of self-reflection that you can only do with some distance. She hasn't dated anyone in a while, she says, and as a result she's had a sort of awakening. \"This last year has been a process of following my impulses,\" she says. \"For a year I wanted to cut my hair. Don't know why, but I did. And so finally I gave in to it. For a very long time I wanted to try living in New York, so eventually I did. And then I just sort of started feeling like I wanted another eat, so I got her, and she's so great.\" Which means maybe there's another big life shake up on the way, right? Actually, no, Swift says. Now, she's most primed to buckle down and get to work.\n\"I don't have anything else that I'm excited about in my life like the way I'm excited about this album,\" she says of 1989, which came out in October and has already spawned the number one hit \"Shake It Off.\" The sound of the album is unapologetic pop, and when I mention it reminds me of Tegan and Sara's Heartthrob, Swift beams. She is, she says, \"a Tegan and Sara purist\" and a huge fan of that record. \"I've been loving albums like that. They capture the essence of a period of time that's gone, but they still sound great on the radio today.\" She looked to find that mix on 1989, with a strong focus on the songwriting. \"Sometimes you become so Immersed in the bells and whistles that you forget that all people real- ly want is a great song,\" she says. This time, \"there's no new boyfriend prospect. There's no distraction. It's just extreme focus and enthusiasm.\" The past few years haven't always been easy. When she broke onto the scene in 2006, everyone loved the sweet, talented underdog. But by 2010, she had become top dog. And with that full celebrity status came extra nonsense. \"I was a singer- songwriter,\" she says. \"I wanted to make music. I didn't know that came with this expectation that your whole life is owned by the gen- eral public and everything you do is dissected, scrutinized and ques- tioned.\" But she's got a handle on it now: strategies to block out the noise while still staying accessible to fans. \"I will continue to have a sunny outlook,\" she says of outlook are a lot easier to than people who are bitter. it all. \"Because [people with] a sunny deal with, be around, befriend and handle People who are, like, complaining about the life of being a celebrity. It's a little irritating\" She's built a really strong circle of friends to rely on and feel safe within. In our conversation she mentions model Karlie Kloss, \"Ella\" (a.k.a. Lorde) and Lena Dunham. \"A lot of my life has to be pro- tected, just because of the circumstances I'm under. But with my friends there's absolutely nothing held back. Every detail of every story is told. There's no editing,\" she says.\nIf there was a period of time that the attention-both good and\nbad-took Swift by surprise, these days she's countimed embracing it. \"Blank Space\" basically takes every criticism that's been levied against her-that she's a serial dater, that she's crazy- and plays with them. It's her Pink \"So What\" moment. She's final- ly at a distance where she can reclaim and disarm the things that used to upset her, \"People talk about their 30s as a time when you feel very settled,\" she says. \"I'm closer to that than ever before.\"\nThat sense of being at a new stage comes through in the songs on the album, but it also has shown in her style. Where once there were pleated skirts and retro cardigans, there are now modern dresses and sleek boots. She's evolved from country girl to girly girl to city girl. \"I love trying things I haven't tried previously,\" she says of her new fashion philosophy. \"I'm a little more comfortable in my own skin in terms of dressing edgier. Not super edgy, though I always want to maintain sort of a dignity to an outfit and make it more about a look rather than something that clearly was worn just to get attention.\" Her go-tos include Topshop ankle boots and structured bags, (\"I like for them to fit in the crook of my arm, to sort of just be there. I don't need my bag to be a state- ment piece.\") And instead of looking back to the '50s, she's enjoy ing the '90s vibe. \"I love a romper,\" she says. \"And I love a short- and-shirt-set situation.\" It's well documented that she also loves a crop top, though only one that allows her to cover up a feature she wants to forever remain private: her belly button.\nSwift brings this up near the end of our time in the birdcage. We're talking about fashion and trends she would never wear (\"Anything with spikes on it. Scary. Like... are we wearing weap- ons?\") and after a thoughtful pause, she mentions it. \"I don't like showing my belly button. When you start showing your belly button then you're really committing to the midriff thing. I only partially commit to the midriff thing-you're only seeing lower rib cage. I don't want people to know if I have one or not.\" She laughs. \"I want that to be a mystery. As far as anyone knows based on my public appearances, they haven't seen evidence of a belly button. It could be pierced. They have no idea. If I'm going to get some sort of massive tattoo, it's going to be right next to my belly button because no one's ever going to see that.\"\nOnce you've talked about belly buttons (even the hypothetical existence of them) in a birdcage, you really feel free to ask any- thing. Her favorite emoji? \"The red heart. And I like randomly sending Santa for no reason. I'm also a big fan of memes.\" She is. Specifically of \"Oh He Mad\" and \"Why U Mad Tho.\" But also of ones that she's in. After the formal part of our interview is over she excitedly shows me a series of memes that fans have made of her. She truly loves them. (Taylor Swift likes to laugh about Taylor Swift, which is kind of cool.) \"People can make fun of me all they want for getting excited when I win an award,\" she says plainly, \"I know for a fact that I've never, ever put on a false pretense.\" The next year of Swift's life will be a blur of album promotion,\ntours, appearances and more. And though to the average person, a schedule like that might seem intensely overwhelming, it's right within her comfort zone. \"I start to feel weird when I'm in a place for longer than three days,\" she admits. \"As much as I love having downtime and wondering what I'm going to do every day, that can be a little bit seary for me.\"\nSo now she's on. On the road, on the record, on stage. \"It's a life of many, many extremes,\" she says. \"And going from one thing to the next. You're getting copious amounts of praise and then the harsh- est criticisms, sometimes in the same breath.\" With that pace and with those expectations, how does she possibly do it all? \"Coffee's a big part of my life,\" she says. \"Skinny caramel lattes are a daily thing that I get excited about and I never stop being excited about.\" She pauses, leans back against the birdcage and thinks it over. \"So if I could just find one person who I felt that way about the way I feel about coffee then I think I'd be in a content relationship.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift On The Meaning Of 'Out Of The Woods' & Loving The Single Life\nIt didn't take long for Taylor Swift's \"Out of the Woods\" to reach the top of the charts.\nAfter being released at midnight on Monday, the song – the second track released on iTunes off of her upcoming \"1989\" album – quickly ascended to the peak of the iTunes charts.\nBut whereas the album's first single, \"Shake It Off,\" was Taylor taking aim at her critics, \"Out of Woods\" returns to a more Taylor-esque musical theme – a tale of love gone wrong.\n\"I wrote that about a time in my life where I was in a relationship and it just kind of, I was always wondering, 'Where do we stand? What are we?'\" Taylor explained in a new interview with Access Hollywood's Liz Hernandez. \"It's the anxiety… that frantic anxiety of wondering if you're on solid ground yet.\"\nBesides relationship anxiety, \"Out of the Woods\" also recounts a surprising snowmobile accident with her ex.\n\"You talk about a snowmobile accident and having to go to the emergency room. You're so truthful in your songs – how did that not make it to the press?\" Liz asked, of the incident.\n\"Honestly, I think I put that in there because people think they know the exact narrative of the way that my life has gone,\" Taylor revealed. \"They think that everybody who reports something is telling the truth. Like, every source is a real friend close to me. When truly, the reason most of the things in the media that are written about me aren't true because none of my real friends would ever talk to the press.\"\nAmong those friends are some very famous faces, including Lena Dunham, Karlie Kloss, Jamie King, Selena Gomez and Lorde – but as for a boyfriend, Taylor insists she is loving the single life!\n\"It's interesting how people say to you when you tell them that you're happy on your own, the first thing they say is, 'Oh don't worry, you'll find someone.' And I'm like no you don't understand. I'm good!\" the 24-year-old singer explained.\n\"People say all the time, 'You need to spend some time to yourself and figure out who you are' and I never really understood it until it happened to me. I woke up one day and I just realized I'm in New York because I want to be in New York. I cut my hair short because I wanted to. I made a pop album because I wanted to,\" she continued. \"There was absolutely no one else influencing me and that was something I was very proud of.\"\nAs for what lies ahead in love, Taylor said, right now, it's the furthest thing from her mind.\n\"Right now, it's not something that I'm interested in. I'm not going to change that part of my life because my life is working right now and I'm happy,\" Taylor told Liz. \"I'm happy about simple things. I'm happy about friendships. I'm happy about music more so that I've ever been before, so that's the part of my life I am really dead set on not changing.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "5 Things All Single 20-Somethings Can Learn From Taylor Swift in the November Issue of InStyle\n\nOctober 17, 2014 @ 5:52 AM\nBY: InStyle Staff\nSure, we can’t all be blessed with singing and songwriting talent bundled into a willowy, model-like 5’9” frame, but there are things every young woman can do to be more like Taylor Swift, InStyle’s cover girl for its November issue, available on newsstands and for digital download now. Consider how we’ve never seen her stumble out of a bar drunk at 3 a.m.; how she’s never had a dreaded wardrobe malfunction; and, well, how everyone just seems to really like her (as evidenced by her gaggle of famous girlfriends). Who wouldn’t want to be like that?\n\nFor November’s cover story, writer Maureen Orth spent some time with the 24-year-old pop star in her five-bedroom Tribeca loft. They talked about her new album, 1989, how she stays so grounded, and why Swift is really happy right now without a man in her life. Here, get a sneak peek at secrets Orth gleaned about Swift’s impeccable put-togetherness, and to read the full interview, pick up the November issue of InStyle, on newsstands now.\n\nREAD MORE: For the Full Interview, Subscribe to InStyle\n\n1. Stop worrying about what people think. Titling her new album 1989, the year she was born, is “based on me learning to care less about what people think of me,” Swift says (though she concedes that’s hard to do in your 20s). Still, “once you think about it, aren’t the people who are living their lives without worrying about other people’s opinions having more fun than those judging them?”\n\n\ntaylor-swift-instyle-cover\n2. Surround yourself with true friends. Swift tells us that she and her pals often gather at her Manhattan pad to have impromptu dance parties or play games of pool—this, she says, is her social life these days. “We see each other whenever we can, and we text all the time,” Swift says of besties like Jaime King, Selena Gomez, Odeya Rush, and Hailee Steinfeld. “It’s a lot easier to be a really great, close friend when that is the only personal relationship you have.”\nRELATED: How to Get Odeya Rush's Bold Beauty Look\n\n3. Don’t party too hard. While you might not have to worry about the paparazzi hounding you, you may have a bad boss or outer-circle mean girl just waiting for you to mess up. “I have friends who will say to me, ‘The press is hating on me for partying,’ and I’m like, ‘Then why don’t you stop partying?’” she says. “If you honestly want them to have nothing to write about, give them nothing to write about.”\n\n4. Call your mom. “Calling my mom is something that kind of calms me down when I’m stressing out, because she knows I stress out more than anyone else,” Swift says.\n\n5. Be picky when it comes to your significant other. Because, let’s be honest, this person better be worth the sacrifice of life’s other riches (see: No. 2). “I am so good alone,” Swift says. “It’s not sad; it’s not tragic.” Cheers to that!",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift is back in a big way with her upcoming album 1989 and we couldn’t help but celebrate with her. Next Monday October 27, Much will be your destination for a brand new special featuring an exclusive interview with T-Swift herself, Much Presents: Taylor Swift at 6:30E/3:30P. Taylor blew in and out of the Much studios like a crisp fall breeze, smelling of freshly baked cookies and emanating the sweetness of a new kitten. And she is also as cool as heck.\nOur Liz Trinnear sat down with the megastar to talk about her major entrance in to the pop world and of course her huge first single, “Shake It Off.” You know, that song that got you jumping out of bed this morning.\n“I started to get inspired by the moments when I would be at awards shows and I would be up dancing enjoying some incredible performance then I’d look around and I’d realize that I was the only one standing up and dancing,” Taylor told us. “And I just would feel a little bit like, I’m just going to shake off the fact that like I’m dancing and no one else is.”\nTaylor isn’t a stranger to public criticism but she used that scrutiny to fuel her song writing, especially when working on “Shake It Off.”\n“I needed a coping mechanism for dealing with people gossiping, criticizing other people constantly and I’ve gotten a lot of comments from my fans and I knew they were going through it too and I wanted to give them a song that would not be victimized,” she said. “It wouldn’t be like poor me I’m being bullied. It would be like, you know what, people are hating on me for being myself I’m going to be myself more.”\nAs for the video that is probably responsible for the most spontaneous dance parties, Taylor revealed that a lot of rehearsing went in to her goofy dance moves. “It was a three day video shoot. We had all these incredible professional dancers all rehearsing and I was rehearsing with them. But, you know, they were rehearsing actual choreography and I was just rehearsing looking like just a complete fool,” Taylor said.\nYou can see this and so much more very very soon. Tune in to Much for the full Much Presents: Taylor Swift on Monday October 27 at 6:30E/3:30P.",

      "Transcript/Content": "So basically, I found this apartment online and was looking at all these different places in New York, and I had my realtor reach out to the realtor who rented this apartment, and we kept trying to get a showing, and they kept putting us off and not responding, so it became like a mystery: why can't we get into this apartment? What's in there? Why do they have it on the market but clearly don't want to sell it?\n\n\"And then so, as I do, we just obsessively called - 'Can I see it? Can I see it? Please? Can I see it?'\n\n\"And so eventually that worked and I got a showing, and I'm walking in kind of like 'What is the deal?'. I fall in love with the place immediately, and then I walk into the kitchen and Gandalf is sitting at the kitchen counter, in his pyjamas.\n\n\"It was magnificent. I was like 'I'm buying it. Does he come with it?'\"\n\nThe 24-year-old also explained how she had \"stalked\" a number of her superfans via the web, before inviting them to her house to hear her new album 1989 with her.\n\n\"You kind of go on the internet and have a look at their Instagrams, maybe look at what their life is like, like 'cute cat, cute dog', and then I would send in the URL for their Twitter, their Tumblr, to my web team, and they compiled this list of people we were going to contact when the time came.\n\n\"So they were contacted, they were told 'meet in a church parking lot at this particular time, we can't tell you any more information other than it's Taylor Swift-related'.\n\n\"So then their phones were taken, they were put on buses and didn't know where they were being taken.\"\n\nTo which Carr quipped: \"It's like a hostage situation.\"\n\nAnd Swift continued: \"I know, but they did it – they signed NDAs and stuff, and then came to my house. The first group didn't realise where they were until they were like snooping around and looking inside the windows of the house, and they see like a Grammy on the mantle, and pictures of my friends, and that was when... I was hiding in the bedroom, spying on them.\n\n\"I'm not coming off well! I'm coming off really creepy!\"\n\nShe explained: \"I think, one of the soaps went missing. Because one of them was like 'she doesn't have any soap in her bathroom', and I was like 'well if there's no soap, it's because somebody took the soap'.\n\n\"So then I just put all these little soaps in the bathroom, so that if they wanted to take them they could. If you want to take the soaps, then I will make it readily available for you to steal them.\n\n\"At least no one's going to go without soap now, I don't want to come off as unclean.\"\n\n\nRead more at http://www.mtv.co.uk/taylor-swift/news/taylor-swift-on-buying-gandalfs-apartment#vCe6Vpbuh5Iii1Sb.99",

News\nBy Bruna Nessif Oct 24, 2014 4:16 AM| Updated Oct 24, 2014 4:13 AMTags\nTaylor Swift has not sworn off dating. But she's not jumping at any suitor that comes her way, either.\n\nThe 24-year-old stopped by E! News to chat with Jason Kennedy and Jesse Giddings about her upcoming pop album 1989 (available Oct. 27) and clarified the statements she made in a recent interview about her dating life.\n\n\"It's not that [I've sworn off dating] as much as I'm just very protective of my happiness,\" Swift explains. \"I found a place in my life that feels really great and I'm not willing to compromise that for just anyone, and so, you can paraphrase that all you want into something very extreme, but they make what I say extreme no matter what I say.\"\n\nShe continues, \"So I'm really happy about the fact that being single doesn't feel like being alone. I have love in my life, I just don't have a relationship, and that feels really natural right now.\"\n\nThose are some Taylor truths right there, people. Take note.\n\nPHOTOS: Taylor Swift's famous friends\n\nRegardless, fans are always fascinated with the speculation of who is behind the chart-topping hits that T.Swift releases, and that's something she's always found intriguing.\n\n\"Well, what's interesting to me is that the formula for my songwriting has never changed. My sound has changed, my style has changed, so many different elements of my life have changed, but the fact that I live my life, I get inspired by my life, I write songs to deal with my life and to cope with it—some of those songs are good enough to make the albums that I put out. I'll write 100 songs and only 13 of them make the album,\" she began.\n\n\"But going back to what you said, it's so interesting that my songwriting method has not changed, the formula hasn't changed, but just the way the rest of the world views me has changed. So it's the same thing as me sitting in class when I was 15 and writing a song about an issue I had or a crush or a disappointment. It's just now I'm not sitting in class now, I'm on a plane across the world, but I'm still writing about my life and I swore to my fans I wouldn't change that, and I'm not going to.\"\n\nThank goodness!",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift to the Haters: ‘If You’re Upset That I’m Just Being Myself, I’m Going to Be Myself More’\nTaylor Swift named her fifth album after her birth year, 1989, but 2014 is the year of her rebirth.\n\n\nBy Gary Graff \n\n10/24/2014\n\nTaylor Swift named her fifth album after her birth year, 1989, but 2014 is the year of her rebirth. After wooing the mainstream with four albums of her pop-flavored brand of country, Swift waves goodbye to Nashville with 1989, ditching guitars for new wave-y synths, courtesy of hitmakers including Max Martin, Shellback, Ryan Tedder and Fun‘s Jack Antonoff, who she met through his girlfriend and her “best friend” Lena Dunham.\n\nBut the LP also marks a personal transition for the 24-year-old: She has a new cropped haircut, debuted a more sophisticated street style and, perhaps most symbolically, moved from Nashville to New York in March. In the past, Swift often seemed to use her music to call out a string of ex-boyfriends. Some already have pointed to One Direction‘s Harry Styles as the inspiration for new single “Out of the Woods.” She is, however, currently single — ” in the past two years [boyfriends] have not been a priority,” she says.\n\nSwift’s mature metamorphosis is going swimmingly so far: “Shake It Off” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, the album is arguably the best of her career, and industry forecasters expect it to sell 800,000 to 900,000 first-week copies — the best sales week for an album in 2014. As 1989 arrives Oct. 27 on Big Machine Records, Swift reveals the reasons behind her professional and personal transformations. “I’ve gone through so many phases and I’ve had to learn so much in front of the entire world,” she says. “I feel much more equipped to deal with things now.”\n\nYour music and your life have both totally changed since your last album. What’s going on?\n\nI like to look at albums as being sort of statements. Visually, sonically, emotionally, I like them all to have their own fingerprint. This time I’m kind of just doing whatever I feel like. I felt like making a pop album, so I did. I felt like being very honest and unapologetic about it, so I did. I felt like moving to New York — I had no reason to, it wasn’t for love or business — so I did. I felt like cutting my hair short, so I did that, too. All these things are in keeping with living my life on my own terms. That’s what I’ve been celebrating about this phase in my life because it has made me really, really happy.\n\nIs that why you made “Shake It Off” the first single? It’s sort of like a mission statement about doing your own thing.\n\n“Shake It Off” is about how I deal with criticism and gossip and humiliation and all those things that used to level me. Now I deal with those things by laughing at them. I didn’t want it to feel victimized. Four years ago I put out a song called “Mean” from the perspective of “Why are you picking on me? Why can I never do anything right in your eyes?” It was coming from a semi-defeated place. Fast-forward a few years and “Shake It Off” is like, “You know what? If you’re upset and irritated that I’m just being myself, I’m going to be myself more, and I’m having more fun than you so it doesn’t matter.”\n\nRelocating to Manhattan seemed to be really key for you — you start 1989 off with “Welcome to New York.”\n\nThat song is about the kind of wide-eyed optimism with which I approached my move to New York. I was so excited by the idea of embarking on a new adventure, and the way that that song sounds is basically mirroring that emotion, like, “Anything’s possible here.”\n\nIn the past you’ve had a lot of so-called “ex–boyfriend” songs. What about this album?\n\nI think “boycentric” is the word people sometimes use for it, but it’s not a very boycentric album because that hasn’t been the focus for me. In the last two years it has not been a priority. So if there’s a song about relationships, it’s reflecting back on an old relationship and what I learned from it. I don’t think anyone from my past or in my life will be really upset by this album. This is the most excited I’ve ever been about an album — it in no way feels like, “Oh, this again…”\n\nWhat makes 1989 so exciting?\n\nThis album was made completely and solely on my terms, with no one else’s opinion factoring in, no one else’s agenda factoring in. I didn’t feel that I was having to think too hard about the musical direction. In the past, I’ve always tried to make sure that I was maintaining a stronghold on two different genres, and this time I just had to think about one, which was creatively a relief. It was nice to be honest about what I was making.\n\nWhy go pop now?\n\nI think what made me decide to do that was that, looking back on my last album, Red, when people would ask me, “What’s your favorite song?” I would always say, without hesitation, “I Knew You Were Trouble.” So when I went in the studio to start this album, I wanted to make sure that this album was different than anything I’d done before, and I was naturally gravitating toward those pop sensibilities and expanding that way. But it wasn’t until about a year in that I admitted to myself and my team that this is a pop album. We can’t call it country; that would be the most disingenuous thing we can do, and out of respect for a [genre] and a music town that I adore, I have to be honest. I think being upfront with people that you care about is the most honest way of going about your life and your decisions.\n\nHas there been any backlash from Nashville?\n\nWell, they know that they’re the ones who brought me to the party and they know I am very well aware of that. But I honestly haven’t experienced anyone really being upset. I think that me being honest and unapologetic about it helps people understand that I’m not trying to fool them. I’m not assuming I can paint a wall blue and tell them it’s green.\n\nWhat’s the primary difference between making pop and country songs?\n\nWhen you’re making pop, you can make a hook out of different elements that I wasn’t able to do previously, and that has been thrilling for me as a songwriter. You can shout, speak, whisper — if it’s clever enough, it can be a hook. Playing around with different sounds has been exciting as well — sounds from the ’80s I was obsessed with, like, synth pop. I love the production of Peter Gabriel and Madonna in the late ’80s, and Annie Lennox and Sinéad O’Connor as far as vocal styling.\n\nHow did you get so into music that came out before you were born?\n\nI love looking back at music history and pop culture history. I’m fascinated by the attitude that the late ’80s seemed to have. In pop music, everybody was taking chances and being creative for the sake of being creative. Everybody was reinventing themselves and taking bold risks and challenging their art. In fashion, everyone was challenging the norm, too — “What are the normal colors we can wear? What are the normal things we can rebel against?” There was a general feeling of intense optimism and endless potential, that really anything was possible. All those things seem to have incorporated themselves into my life in the last two years. I look at this album as me starting over.",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Exclusive Interview, Translation by me] Men always question everything: Taylor Swift's life and her music. Notable ex-lovers like John Mayer, Taylor Lautner, Jake Gyllenhaal and teen god Harry Styles from One Direction were always good for a break-up song. In million-selling songs like \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" or \"I Knew You Were Trouble\", the queen of break-up songs laid bare her failed loves. And in doing so, many critics portrayed her as a clingy woman desperately looking for a husband. Even some comedians enjoyed Swift's relationship material, and everyone found headlines like \"Watch out brother, she's going to write a song about you!\" funnier than the person in question. \"It seems like watching my dating life,\" Swift told \"Rolling Stone\". Her conclusion: she is not dating anymore for the time being. And her new single Shake it off is a message to all know-it-alls and snoopers to get lost. Shake it all off, move forward and make peace with yourself, is how Taylor describes her feelings. The award-winning singer has been single for 18 months now. Finding someone is the last thing on my mind.\" Her est friends, who are used to the limelight themselves, make things less stressful. Singer Lorde, for example, Cara Delevingne or supermodel Karlie Kloss, who has only the most beautiful words for Taylor: modest, considerate, with a heart of gold... But the song still can't quite do without her ex. The planned second single, \"Out Of The Woods,\" is supposed to be about Harry Styles as well. But it is another breakup that concerns Taylor Swift much more: The country princess, who has loved cowboy music since she was a child and got her first record deal at 14, has said goodbye to her old passion. The new album is pure pop. \"I didn't want to offend my fans, but as an artist you need challenges,\" says she, who writes all her songs herself. The fact that the new single immediately shot into the top 10 in 60 countries, including top spots, shows that the fans are on board. The new CD 1989 will be released on October 27th. Its predecessor \"Red\" sold six million copies worldwide. And if you want to see Taylor Swift in her film debut, all you have to do is buy a ticket: The science fiction film \"The Giver\" is currently in theatres.\n\n\"HAPPINESS IS NOT PERMANENT...\"\nWOMAN: You named your album \"1989\" after your birth year. Why?\nSWIFT: Because I'm going in a completely new musical direction. This is my first pop album and it feels like a musical rebirth. It's also about standing up for yourself and having more fun in life than the people who just want to put you down. Despite all the success, I still have to deal with personal attacks.\nWOMAN: How do you deal with it?\nSWIFT: If I've learned anything, it's that we can't control what others say about us, but we can control how we react. We can let the comments get to us and become bitter, or we can just brush them off.\nWOMAN: Your affairs with prominent men have also provided some opportunities for attack. In interviews you said that a new love is almost impossible for you because cameras are constantly following everything.\nSWIFT: Yes, I'm better off being single at the moment. I can't imagine how a relationship would work with the way I live.\nWOMAN. But you also said that being single does have its advantages. You can concentrate completely on your own needs.\nSWIFT: Yes, I would also like to encourage people not to neglect their goals because of vague fears, such as loneliness. If things aren't going the way you want, then you just have to change your perspective on things. For women, a new look is often enough. The next step is to ask yourself: What actually makes me the happiest?\nWOMAN: You are friends with Lena Dunbam, the star of the series Girls. How did the tough Lena influence you?\nSWIFT: She changed my attitude towards feminism. I always had a problem with the term. To me it sounded like fighting men, rather than men and women having equal rights and opportunities. I see that differently now - many young women today no longer have a problem calling themselves feminists.\nWOMAN: The film The Giver describes a future without war and hunger - but also without passion. Would people be happier that way?\nSWIFT: I don't think so. Lots of fans write to me on Twitter or Instagram about great pain, loss or uncertainty. I can say as consolation: We live for the fleeting moments of happiness. Happiness is not permanent, sometimes we only catch a glimpse of it. But it's worth it. I think that's what the film can convey.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift, “All Too Well” and “You Belong With Me”\n“My strength with Taylor isn’t writing lyrics. It’s whittling things down and pulling out the important pieces. She’ll talk a lot and mumble and say lines, and I’ll write them down really fast and keep them stored away. Then I’ll take her back to those lines and say, ‘What about this?’ I don’t mess with her style, lyrically. I let her say what she wants to say. People used to tell me, ‘You’re more like an editor with Taylor,’ and it used to frustrate me, because I can write lyrics, too. But those people were right. Taylor is good because she has lyrics that work for her age. I just help her grab the ones that are great.\n\n‘You Belong With Me’ was written at the very end of the recording sessions for Fearless. She said, ‘I’m finishing the record on Monday. Let’s write an uptempo song.’ We wrote ‘You Belong With Me’ in one or two hours. It’s amazing to go back to the work tape and listen to it, because you wouldn’t believe the nuances that show up in the album version, too. When she’s writing something, she’s already producing in her head. She hears it all.\n\nWhen we did ‘All Too Well,’ I hadn’t heard from her in awhile. She hadn’t really been writing. I was in Nashville one day, slowly moving the last bits of junk out of my garage so I could move to Dallas. My house had already sold, so I had to come back and clean it out. I had a trailer and four guys helping me, and I was sick with some kind of sinus infection. It was just the worst day. I was in my driveway and my phone rings, and it’s Taylor saying, ‘Man, I’ve got this thing and I really need you to help me with it. Can you write today? What are you doing today?’ So I gave those guys the keys to my storage place, told them to put all my stuff into storage and drove over to Taylor’s.\n\nIt was the first song she wrote for that record, I think. She had a story and she wanted to say something specific. She had a lot of information. I just let her go. She already had a melody and she started singing some words, and I started writing things down, saying, ‘Ok, let’s use this, let’s use that.’ She mentioned a plaid shirt, and I wrote that down in a corner, and when we got to the end, I said, ‘Let’s put the plaid shirt in there.’ That turned into one of the best lines: ‘After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own/Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone/But you keep my old scarf from that very first week/’Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me.’ It was the most emotional, in-depth song we’ve ever written.\n\nShe’s such a force. You remember the songs you write with Taylor, because the emotion that goes into them is so palpable. One of my daughters is her age, so I understood that I needed to stand back a bit and make sure we wrote Taylor songs, not Liz songs. I didn’t mess with her. The writers that did try to mess with her lyrics? She didn’t write with them a second time.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Interview: Changing Things Up With ’1989′ and Turning 25 [EXCLUSIVE]\n“I know that I don’t have the option of making music that sounds just like what I’ve done before,” Taylor Swift tells PopCrush, talking about what went through her head when making her new album, ’1989.’ “People will call me out on it. They’ll see right through it.”\n“They’ll see that I was lazy,” she adds with a laugh. “So with this album I definitely changed things up and I think I changed them for the better.”\n’1989′ is Taylor’s first “official” pop album (meaning, there’s not a single track here that was made with country radio in mind), but it’s not a total musical rebirth — just her next act as an artist. Her commitment to telling a story with her lyrics hasn’t changed.\nDuring our conversation about ’1989,’ Taylor chats with us about developing as a songwriter and the tracks on the album that she’s most proud of (as well as Ed Sheeran and Lorde‘s favorite songs). Plus, just before celebrating her 25th birthday this December, she reflects on the past 10 years of her life — and why she wouldn’t want to fix any of the mistakes she’s made. Read the full interview below.\nWho was the first person to listen to ’1989,’ and what was their reaction?\nI think one of the first people that I played the entire album for was my friend Ella, who goes by Lorde. She’s one of my favorite people to kind of bounce ideas off of — she gives really good advice. And it’s interesting to see what her favorites are. Another person that’s heard the entire album is Ed Sheeran. Having friends where who I completely respect their musical opinion is really helpful because they all have their different favorites and stuff, and their different favorites definitely reflect them as musicians, for sure.\nElla’s favorite is a song called ‘Welcome to New York,’ and Ed’s favorite song is called ‘Bad Blood.’\nWhich song on ’1989′ was the most difficult to write?\nYou know, it’s interesting because the songs that are difficult to write always end up being less interesting than the ones that just kind of come from some crazy sparks of creativity. A lot of the songs on the album that I’m most proud of are ones that I got an idea and just kind of rolled with it and went with it, and 20 minutes later I had most of the song done. So I kind of have been following that. I’ve been following the idea that if you get a really crazy lightning bolt idea, then that’s the one you should chase and the one that you show follow. If it’s a little bit harder to get into the groove with a song, then maybe… it’s just not as good of an idea.\nSo it’s learning to trust your natural instincts.\nDefinitely. I think as a songwriter, the more and more you write and the more albums that you put out, the more you learn about what to do with an idea, how to build it, how to craft a song, how to craft a song differently than you’ve done it before.\nIt’s a really exciting challenge to make a fifth album. I know that I don’t have the option of making music that sounds just like what I’ve done before. People will call me out on it. They’ll see right through it. They’ll see that I was lazy [laughs], so with this album I definitely changed things up and I think I changed them for the better.\nHow do you know when you’ve really got a good song?\nI think the way that I determine whether a song’s good enough to make the album is if I want to keep going back on my iPod and listening to it over and over and over. There are songs that I want to listen to over and over and over, and then there are songs that I kind of just stop gravitating toward after a few months. You never want to be too seduced by the excitement of creating something new that you can’t be critical of it. So I write for two years, and usually most of the stuff that I write in the first six months to a year gets thrown out.\nWhich new songs did you listen to the most on your iPod?\nI think the one that I kept going back to, over and over and over again, is a song called ‘This Love,’ actually. It’s a song that I wrote by myself. It’s kind of like hypnotic in a way, and it kind of is somewhat romantic and wistful and relaxing. But I would also listen to ‘Out of the Woods’ a lot.\nWhat lyric from the album are you most proud of?\nThere’s one song on the album that I wrote with Imogen Heap called ‘Clean,’ and almost every line in that song is one that I’m proud of, so I’m really excited for people to hear that one.\nI brought her the idea, I brought her the verse and chorus of the song, and one of the most important elements of that song is the production, so she created this kind of incredible sonic world for this song to live in. And I’m so excited to have worked with her because she’s just, I think, one of the most interesting and unique artists out there.\nWhat was the inspiration behind ‘Clean’?\nThe song ‘Clean’ is one that I wrote about sort of coming out of a relationship, or trying to move on from some struggle that you had in your life, and feeling kind of tarnished by it. And it kind of talks about how if you really allow yourself to feel pain, I think maybe it’s easier to get past it. For most people that I’ve known who’ve fought through struggle, a lot them who have really just faced the pain head on have come out OK a lot faster than the ones who just pretended to be in denial of it.\nThe song is so kind of haunting because [of] Imogen’s background on the song, she’s singing on it. So, it’s so exciting [for me].\nSpeaking of exciting things: You’ve given a once-in-a-lifetime memory to some lucky fans with your ’1989′ Secret Sessions. What’s been YOUR personal biggest fangirl moment with an artist you love?\nThe ’1989′ Secret Sessions were my favorite part of this whole thing of putting out ’1989′ because these were people who had never met me before, and they had been to shows or they waited outside ‘Good Morning America’ or they have an amazing blog dedicated to my music, and I never got to say thank you until we did these secret listening sessions in my houses all across the country and London.\nBut I think — as far as fangirling goes — meeting Imogen Heap was an amazing experience for me because she was all I listened to in high school. Getting to not only meet her, but work with her and watch to see what she does in the studio was really inspiring.\nWhat was the first thing you said Imogen when you met her?\nHi, I’m so happy to meet you? [Laughs.] I try to keep it in check. I try to act as, like, normal as humanly possible.\nYou’re turning 25 this year. What advice would you give your past self from your present self?\nI think looking back because I’m about to turn 25 is interesting — to have gone through so many phases in front of the entire world. Because, you know, I’ve been making music and putting it out since I was 15. Looking back, you’re very well aware of your mistakes, you’re well aware of your own phases and your ups and your downs.\nI’ve had a lot of time to reflect on that, and even so — even though you know where you could’ve made a better decision or you could’ve said a better thing, or something like that, I just think I wouldn’t change anything because I think being a songwriter, every experience you have… and your experience shapes your work. So even the times where I’ve felt terrible emotions like regret or humiliation or embarrassment or failure, I took those emotions and kind of turned them into the next batch of songs. So it kind of leaves you in this place where you wouldn’t really give yourself any advice to help yourself out, because even your struggles kind of got you to where you wanted to be.\nHow did you picture your 25-year-old self when you were younger?\nI don’t know what I thought because I always tried to be realistic about things, so even though I was trying to be a musician, I didn’t have expectations that I would end up being a musician.\nI would not have pictured anything close to this. I would have never thought, ‘Oh, I’m going to live in New York, and I’m gonna have friends that I love so much, and I’m gonna get to do this, I’m gonna be on stadium tours’… it just, it was nowhere near this. I think my dream looked a lot like this, but my expectations were kind of… I thought that, you know, I’d still be looking for what I want to do with my life, which is completely normal for 25. A lot of my friends are in that place right now. I’m just really grateful that fans connected with what I was writing because that’s the only reason I’m here.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Don't go breaking my heart - Taylor Swift opens up\n\nBarry Egan\nMon 27 Oct 2014 at 03:30\nShe's the biggest pop star in the world. So, naturally, Taylor Swift wanted to bare her soul to Barry Egan.\nShe even told him she felt talking to him was like talking to herself. Here, in our exclusive interview, she reveals her innermost fears and doubts; how she had her heart 'ripped out' by the end of her relationship with heart-throb Jake Gyllenhaal; why she always picks the wrong men (albeit famous ones such as Harry Styles); how she uses her lyrics to process the emotions of a break-up - and why she will only run out of having break-ups to write about 'if I stop having break-ups'\n\nTo interview her is to pay a state visit. You know you're dealing with a star of astronomical proportions when the record company sends a car to pick you up at the airport. And there is someone from her management team to bring you to a waiting room on the 10th floor of a grand hotel with a courtyard filled with flashy cars straight out of a James Bond movie.\n\nWhat follows is almost ritualistic. You sign a confidentiality agreement form. Then, after a while, someone comes to take you to a suite where you are given an iPod. Then another person hands you earphones and presses play so that, amid much secrecy, you get to hear three songs from the star's new album, called 1989, after the year of her birth.\n\nOnce that is finished you are brought to another, much bigger, much grander suite, where the star awaits your questions on those three songs and anything else that you might care to ask her. The correspondent from a Japanese magazine is leaving just as I am going in. \"She is very talkative,\" he says, as an English journalist sits down to his turn after me at the iPod. It is quite an operation.\n\n\"'Star' used to be reserved for a small number of people,\" playwright Tom Stoppard once said, \"and when the star category became so vast, they came up with 'superstar,' and then they came up with 'megastar.'\"\n\nTaylor Swift - for it is she - is a megastar with bells on. Last year, the cover of New York magazine spelled out her contribution to popular culture's zeitgeist: \"Not Katy. Not Miley. Not Gaga. Why Taylor Swift is the Biggest Pop Star in the World.\"\n\nIn person, Taylor Swift looks like a 1930s flapper siren, reimagined for a new age of pop ultra-stardom with a touch of the girl-next-door thrown in. She is extremely polite and almost impossibly normal and, above all, fun. Her girl-next-door, down-to-earth demeanour belies the vast scale of her jaw-dropping success.\n\nThe Guardian described Ms Swift's supersonic rise from \"ringletted country artist, teenage sweetheart of the American heartland, to feminist role model and the world's most charming pop star\" to become \"the kind of culturally titanic figure adored as much by gnarly rock critics as teenage girls, feminist intellectuals and, well, pretty much all of emotionally sentient humankind.\"\n\nPretty much all of emotionally sentient humankind appears to have bought at least one of Taylor Swift's albums. She's sold over 30m copies of them. And when you factor in world tours that sell out in the blink of an eye, and endorsements and what-have-you, it is not particularly difficult to see why Forbes magazine estimated that the 24-year-old woman sitting in front of me made something in the region of $64m last year.\n\n\"It's not the hardest job to have in the world,\" she says with disarming charm of this day of international media interviews, as I take a seat opposite her. \"I try to remind myself of that. I'm sitting in a chair, talking about music. It's not that big of a deal.\"\n\nTaylor Swift, however, is very much a big deal. Her every utterance and action is world news or at least trending on Twitter. Her lyrics are dissected by culture vultures as though they are the Dead Sea Scrolls of post-teen angst. Her 2010 song Dear John had the famous lines, \"Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?/The girl in the dress cried the whole way home/ I should've known\". It is about singer John Mayer, who was 32 when he and Taylor broke up in February, 2010.\n\nThe ballad All Too Well included the even more famous line: \"You call me up again just to break me like a promise/So casually cruel in the name of being honest\". The song's reputed target is the actor Jake Gyllenhaal, whom she dated in mid 2010, and broke up with a year later. Scurrilous reports even had it that Jake took then 20-year-old Taylor's virginity and then dropped her, abominably, on her 21st birthday.\n\nThen there was the 2012 song, I Knew You Were Trouble, about One Direction's Harry Styles, whom she was dating for a time in 2012.\n\nMost memorably, perhaps, was when singer Joe Jonas broke it off with Taylor in 2008, and then began dating actress Camilla Belle: the song Taylor wrote, Better Than Revenge was nigh venomous: \"She's an actress/She's better known for the things that she does on the mattress\".\n\nSwift's lyrics are not so much autobiographical as heart-rending, and sometimes pure vicious lines ripped from her private diary - or what critic Robert Christgau described as her \"diaristic realism.\" Her new album does not disappoint in the heart-on-bloody-sleeve department either. I ask Taylor what goes through her mind when she wrote lyrics such as, \"You look like my next mistake\". This is one of the three songs I got to hear from the new album seconds before our interview. \"Actually, that song was a joke,\" she smiles. \"I wrote that as a joke. And I think people think I'm serious when they listen to it.\"\n\nI nod to the effect that I thought, too, she was serious.\n\n\"But the idea of that song is that I was sitting around, thinking about the media's fictionalised, cartoon version of me,\" she says, \"where I'm like this jet-setting serial dater/man eater. I was thinking about that perception. And I was thinking about how interesting it might be to write from that perspective, if I was that way.\n\n\"Like, if I was that girl, exactly as they write about me, what would be my mission statement? What would be my life story, my life's motto. So I just wrote that song,\" says the singer, who was born on December 13, 1989, raised in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, and released her self-titled debut album when she was a mere 16 years old.\n\nWhat emotions come up for the public when they hear the words Taylor Swift? I ask her. How do you think the world sees that person?\n\n\"That is such an interesting question, because I think about that all the time,\" she says, adding that being her is sometimes akin to an out-of-body experience.\n\n\"I think we all wonder what the perception is of us to strangers,\" she explains. \"But I think there is no real right answer to that, because everyone has their own opinion based on how much of you they've been exposed to. Like, if someone has listened to all my albums then they'd have a different opinion of me than someone who has only heard one song.\"\n\nAnd if you could have an out-of-body experience and listen and watch yourself, what would you think of Taylor Swift?\n\n\"Ohhh. I don't know! I think I would be,\" she says sweetly, pausing, \"I think I would like my lyrics.\"\n\nI say that for such a big star, the lyrics on the new album are almost novelistic - \"I'll end up in flames or I'll end up in paradise\"; \"Boys only want love if it is torture.\"\n\nAsked what kind of books she reads, Taylor says, \"Oh my gosh, I like to read historical things. I like to read biographies. I really like things that actually happen. I just read this book by Peter Evans called The Secret Conversations, the Ava Gardner biography. It is not necessarily biography; it is a book he wrote about the process of interviewing her for her biography that she then decided she didn't want to do. Did you read the book?\" she asks.\n\nFrank Sinatra threatened to kill himself if she didn't come back to him, I reply.\n\n\"You totally read the excerpts in Vanity Fair,\" she gushes.\n\nWould your relationships be as, er, . . . feisty as Ava's? I ask.\n\n\"No - she and I are very different. We have very different personalities. But I love Ava Gardner,\" she says of the American legend who had a tumultuous marriage to Sinatra from 1951 to 1957.\n\nShe seemed to revel in driving Frank literally mad, I suggest.\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" Taylor Swift says, looking at me, wondering where this is going.\n\nAnd you have the potential with your music and your lyrics to drive exes mad. She laughs. \"I think that the only way that I know how to process difficult and complex emotions that I can't figure out how to navigate through in my own mind is to write a song about them and then they become simplified to me. It's almost like I then know how to process them, when I write a verse/chorus/verse/chorus/bridge/chorus/out\", she explains.\n\nI felt like I had looked in your diary with some of these very raw lyrics, I say to her as the bottled water sits unsipped to her left.\n\n\"I feel like my diary has been public since I've been 16,\" Taylor replies, \"because that is true. And I mean, it is very interesting living your life that way because as things have progressed and as you get more known and more, I guess, recognised and all that, there are higher stakes to being vulnerable. Like, opening up your diary to the world; you know you are going to have some people go, 'Hey, yeah, I relate to that. I felt that too', and then some people are going to be, like, 'She's so annoying,' You know?\" she says.\n\n\"You have people who have really, really, incredibly, intensely positive feelings about you,\" she laughs, \"and then you have people who are giving you intense senseless criticism. I can always handle constructive criticism.\"\n\nAren't you worse for listening to the intense senseless criticism? I wonder.\n\n\"I do try to limit the amount of senseless criticism that I listen to, but I do read journalists' take on my music, because I think that helps me grow. And, honestly, if someone whose job it is to study music has an opinion, then I think that's valid. There have been times when I have read a review and thought, 'You know what, I could work on that for the next record.'\"\n\nBut you're the one who sells millions upon millions of records. You can do it; they can't. They are the eunuchs in the harem.\n\n\"Yeah,\" she laughs. \"But it's a fine line, because I love to watch other people's careers. I love to study other people's career arcs and things like that. And one thing that I do notice a lot is a lot of celebrities cannot handle constructive criticism. So they only listen to the positive feedback and then they exist only in this world where they surround themselves with sycophantic people who tell them everything they want to hear all the time. And that's the opposite end of that pendulum swing.\"\n\nAnd then you'd be on medication, I say, by being in that world.\n\n\"I have a really high priority on staying sane. It's a huge deal,\" she says.\n\nHow do you stay sane?\n\n\"Well - I over-think a lot about everything\"\n\nYou're 24. If you didn't over-think you wouldn't be sane.\n\n\"Yeah! Exactly! And especially as a songwriter you have to stay open. You have to stay open to feeling things - like rejection and, you know, loss and disappointment; and reminiscing about things. It is just the same as you have to still feel joy and enthusiasm and excitement. As a songwriter, I can't put up barricades and emotional barriers to protect myself.\"\n\nWere you always so honest? You wrote Revenge when you were 18. To be that young and write the lyrics, \"She's an actress/She's better known for the things that she does on the mattress . . .\"\n\n\"I just always wanted to be able to say what I actually felt, and put it into a song and put it out into the world,\" Taylor answers. \"What is interesting is that it is about my life when I write it and then I put it out into the world and it is about someone else's life when they're listening to it.\"\n\nYou said something fascinating in an interview about that song Revenge: \"I used to think people could steal your boyfriend . . .\"\n\nTaylor finishes the quote, \"But no one can steal your boyfriend from you if he doesn't want to leave.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" she says, suddenly all girl power. \"An interesting part about having grown up with all of my inner thoughts and lessons and doubts and fears and anger issues being put into these songs and these lyrics is, sometimes, you change your mind. Like, sometimes you handle things differently.\"\n\n\"Like, two albums ago I had a song that I put out called Mean that was about this critic who would not get off of my back and wanted to end my career with his reviews alone. I felt very victimised by it. So I wrote this song that was, 'Why have you got to be so mean?' It came from a place of such hurt. Then fast-forward and the way that I now handle criticism is reflected in Shake It Off,\" she says referring to her new single, which is old-school pop in the mould of Gwen Stefani's Hollaback Girl, with Taylor, tongue-in-cheekily telling the haters to jump in the Hudson River:\n\n\"I stay up too late, got nothing in my brain/That's what people say mmm, that's what people say/I go on too many dates, but I can't make 'em stay/At least that's what people say mmm, that's what people say/. . . And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.\"\n\n\"Shake It Off is a much different way of dealing with it,\" she explains. \"Which is kind of like, 'OK, you don't like me for being myself? I'm just going to be myself more!'\"\n\nAnd who are you?\n\n\"Me? Wow! You are really . . . \"\n\nI'm Irish. We're obsessed with death and sex and God.\n\n\"I am too! So this is like talking to myself. I think what's interesting - and I have been thinking about this a lot - is the idea of celebrity and fame and all those strange concepts is that it affects people differently in every situation. I see a lot of people where it overtakes them and it becomes them. Then I think I've seen other people - I hope I'm in this group - where they remain in somewhat of a normal mind-frame and have sort of a self-awareness about the fact that their life is being . . . that there are all these completely weird and abnormal circumstances swirling around their life. And they are just trying to stay in a normal mind-space about all of it. So, I think, that's the group I'm in.\"\n\nIsn't it a slight dichotomy? In the sense that you have written a lot of songs about failed relationships and break-ups. If you meet Mr Right and the relationship is fantastic, will your creativity crumble? Does that worry you?\n\n\"Yeah! I think about that all the time,\" she says.\n\nWhy don't you just lie about your relationships then? You could be in a happy relationship and pretend not to be.\n\n\"I wish!\" she exclaims. \"God, if I didn't have 40 paparazzi outside my door every day, then that would be a lot easier, but I do think about that a lot, because songwriting is the only reason I do this. Like, if I didn't write my own songs I wouldn't be a singer; I wouldn't be on stage.\"\n\nAre you saying you have to be miserable in order to write songs?\n\n\"No. I am saying I have to write songs in order to be onstage. So if my inspiration ever dried up,\" Taylor says. \"It's kind of like, you wonder if that can really happen. I think after a certain period of time, you have learned a skill; you know how to be open to inspiration at all times; you know how to catch ideas when they kind of land in front of you.\"\n\nAs Taylor tries to suture her wounds, some of her critics are sharpening their long, bloody knives. They don't know what to make of Taylor's brand of l'amour. \"Retrograde, a prude infatuated with white-knight romance,\" went one criticism in the Noughties.\n\nDodai Stewart, in a post on the website ­Jezebel entitled, 'Taylor Swift is a Feminist's Nightmare,' wrote: \"For Taylor, 15 means falling for a boy and dreaming of marrying him. My 15 was more like: Flirt with this one, make out with that one, try a cigarette, get drunk, lie to your parents, read some Anais Nin; [Swift's] image of being good and pure plays right into how much the patriarchy fetishises virginity, loves purity, and celebrates women who know their place as delicate flowers.\"\n\nMaybe a more important point that these critics are missing is that if Anais Nin was around today she'd probably be writing lyrics like those in Revenge or All Too Well and putting them to music so we could tune in to MTV to hear about her tortured love life.\n\nThe question of Taylor's tortured love life has become almost an international obsession. Last month, she was asked by Rolling Stone if she had ever been in love. The answer from the girl who has been romantically entwined to various degrees with Joe Jonas, Taylor Lautner, John Mayer, Jake Gyllenhaal, Harry Styles and Conor Kennedy, was typically Taylor in its Jane Austen melodrama: \"Not real love. Not the kind that lasts.\" Boo hoo.\n\nI ask Taylor if she will ever run out of break-ups to write about.\n\n\"I would probably run out of break-ups to write about if I stopped having break-ups,\" she laughs, \"because my music is very autobiographical. But, on this new album, one theme that you will see that has kind of faded is the idea of the guy, the boy, has faded into the background. It is not as much about writing about a boy or a guy or losing a guy. It is more reflective on relationships and the lessons I've learned and taken away from those relationships.\"\n\nWhat lessons are those?\n\n\"There are a lot of them,\" answers the young woman who once called one of her songs We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together. \"You heard a song called Out Of The Woods [on the new album]which is kind of about me realising that there is no happily ever after. It is a constant struggle. Every day is, 'Are we going to make it till tomorrow?'\n\nWhat kind of guys are you drawn to?\n\n\"Right now?\" she asks \"I haven't been looking. I haven't dated in a really long time.\"\n\nBut, generally, some people when they are in a bad space will be drawn to partners who accentuate or reinforce their low self-esteem. Or if they are in a good space, they will be drawn to someone who brings them up.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she says, \"I have always had that - you dream about the ideal situation, if you ever were to meet someone and it were to be right. I think if it were to be right, it would be someone who is very sunny and bright. I think that would be the ideal match. But then again, I have no idea. I don't know. I don't know anything! I haven't been dating in a really long time. I haven't been looking for a very long time. I've just been focusing on music and my friends. I think it is really important for twentysomethings to take some time to themselves and figure out who they are on their own terms.\"\n\nI say to Taylor that if all her lyrics - with the exception of this new album - are autobiographical, then she seems to be meeting the wrong guys on a regular basis?\n\n\"I think, I have thought about this a lot, I may have been mistaking my idea of always challenging myself in my career for always looking for someone who is a constant challenge in my personal life. If I was to put some sort of psychological spin on it, it would be that,\" she says. \"I had ambition in my career and, you know, you're looking for someone who always seems like an obstacle, a challenge, and that is not necessarily what will end up making you happy.\"\n\nWhy not just fall in love, Taylor?\n\n\"You're full of these questions that have no answers! Would you be able to answer that question?\"\n\nGive me a glass of whiskey and I'll have a go, I say. She laughs.\n\nDid you really call Ed Sheeran a substitute boyfriend? \"No! Who said that?\" She roars with laughter again. \"I never called him that. I called him my best friend. He is one of my best friends. But it has never occurred to either of us to date. We would never do it.\"\n\nI ask her about All Too Well.\n\n\"That was a song I wrote that was very brutally honest and kind of,\" she pauses, \"kind of hard to release because putting that out into the world is kind of exposing people to the fact that you've got your heart sort of ripped out when you were 19, 20. But telling the story of it from beginning to end was kind of like a way of saying goodbye to it for me.\"\n\nAnd healing yourself as well.\n\n\"Oh yeah! Ab-so-lutely.\"\n\nI say that I used to love Jake Gyllenhaal's movies but when I listen to the words of All Too Well (all together now: \"You call me up again just to break me like a promise\") I will never, ever, ever, watch Donnie Darko - the 2001 supernatural classic starring Mr Gyllenhaal, his sister Maggie and Drew Barrymore - again.\n\nAlthough she has never publicly admitted that Mr Gyllenhaal was the subject of the song - until now, effectively, to LIFE - Taylor cracks up laughing for the trillionth time in the evening.\n\n\"Oh my god! You and I are going to be best friends. We are just going to hang out! We are just going to go to Ireland and hang out in a pub.\"\n\nI'm 47. You're 24. I'm married.\n\n\"Bring the family. We'll talk about life.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Official Transcript] Melissa Block: I enlisted some expert outside counsel for this interview: my 12-year-old daughter. And I want to start with a question from her. \"In your hit song 'Shake It Off,' why'd you address the song to your haters and not your motivators?\"\n\nTaylor Swift: That's amazing. With the song 'Shake It Off,' I really wanted to kind of take back the narrative, and have more of a sense of humor about people who kind of get under my skin — and not let them get under my skin. There's a song that I wrote a couple years ago called \"Mean,\" where I addressed the same issue but I addressed it very differently. I said, \"Why you gotta be so mean?\" from kind of a victimized perspective, which is how we all approach bullying or gossip when it happens to us for the first time. But in the last few years I've gotten better at just kind of laughing off things that absolutely have no bearing on my real life. I think it's important to be self-aware about what people are saying about you, but even more so, be very aware of who you actually are, and to have that be the main priority.\n\nHere's a related question about the same song, from a 7th grader. She's thinking about the lyrics, and she says, \"That sounds a lot like middle school. Do you have anything that you can tell a middle school girl to help 'shake it off'\"?\n\nShe's exactly right. When I was in middle school, I had this fantasy — and I really thought this was how life worked — that when we were in school, we had to deal with bullying and kids picking on you for no reason, or making you feel like somehow don't deserve what you want, or you're not what you should be. And I thought that when you grow up and you're not in school anymore, when you're out there in the world with adults, that it's not like that anymore, that people don't attack each other for no reason or try to tear each other down. And I realized when I grew up that it's the same. It's the same dynamics, except we're not walking from classroom to classroom.\n\nIt's just interesting how you have to learn how to deal with this at one point or another in your life because people don't necessarily ever grow out of those impulses to pick on each other. Some of us do; some of us realize that's something you do when you're insecure, you try to lash out at someone else. But a lot of people will always do that to other people. So I guess what I try to encourage girls who are in middle school to do is to figure out a way to distract yourself from that negativity. Figure out what kind of art you love to create, or your favorite hobby. Something to throw all of your energy into. And realize that you're gonna have to learn how to cope with this at some point — because it's never going to end, necessarily.\n\nThere's definitely a different sound on this new album. You've left country completely behind; this is a really highly produced electronic pop album. But you also say to your fans in the liner notes that \"this is a different story line than I've ever told you before.\" I'm not sure I'm hearing that — so what do you think is new about the storyline in these songs?\n\nIn the past, I've written mostly about heartbreak or pain that was caused by someone else and felt by me. On this album, I'm writing about more complex relationships, where the blame is kind of split 50-50. I'm writing about looking back on a relationship and feeling a sense of pride even though it didn't work out, reminiscing on something that ended but you still feel good about it, falling in love with a city, falling in love with a feeling rather than a person. And I think there's actually sort of a realism to my new approach to relationships, which is a little more fatalistic than anything I used to think about them. I used to think that, you know, you find \"the one.\" And it's happily ever after, and it's never a struggle after that. You have a few experiences with love and relationships, and you learn that that's not the case at all. Lots of things are gray areas and complicated situations, and even if you find the right situation relationship-wise, it's always going to be a daily struggle to make it work. So those are different themes that I don't think people have really seen in my lyrics before.\n\nIs the song \"Wildest Dreams\" maybe an example of that?\n\nThat's actually a really good example of the way I go into relationships now. If I meet someone who I feel I have a connection with, the first thought I have is: \"When this ends, I hope it ends well. I hope you remember me well.\" Which is not anything close to the way I used to think about relationships. It's that realization that it's the anomaly if something works out; it's not a given.\n\nAre there new musical influences here? Some music reviewers have been mentioning the influence of Lorde or Lana Del Rey or maybe Robyn in some of your songs. What do you hear?\n\nI hear Peter Gabriel and I hear Annie Lennox. Those were the two artists that I was listening to a lot when I was making this record. What Annie does is so interesting to me, and it's not something you could ever try to duplicate. But the way she conveys a thought, there's something really intense about it. And I think that's something I'll always aspire to.\n\nAnd what about Peter Gabriel?\n\nWith Peter, that's an artist who has such incredible taste and such an incredible finger on the pulse of what would excite people, musically. What he was doing in the '80s was so ahead of its time, because he was playing with a lot of synth-pop sounds, but kind of creating sort of an atmosphere behind what he was singing, rather than a produced track. It was just kind of astonishing how he was able to do that. And then you see him in his later work, when he did that album full of modern-day covers. I mean, I just think that he's remarkable at giving people what they want, but they didn't think they wanted.\n\nI want to ask you about the song \"Out Of The Woods.\" There's this intriguing lyric in there about somebody \"hitting the brakes too soon, 20 stitches in a hospital room.\" What's that about?\n\nThat line is in there because it's not only the actual, literal narration of what happened in a particular relationship I was in, it's also a metaphor. \"Hit the brakes too soon could mean the literal sense of, we got in an accident and we had to deal with the aftermath. But also, the relationship ended sooner than it should've because there was a lot of fear involved. And that song touches on a huge sense of anxiety that was, kind of, coursing through that particular relationship, because we really felt the heat of every single person in the media thinking they could draw up the narrative of what we were going through and debate and speculate. I don't think it's ever going to be easy for me to find love and block out all those screaming voices.\n\nNot to ignore the broader metaphor here, but I am curious about the actual event. What happened?\n\nI'll bet you are. That's kind of between us, between the two people who it happened to. I think I put it in the song knowing it was an evocative lyric. And it was almost like this very strange, subtle clue to the media that they don't know everything that happened in that relationship, and they don't know everything that happens in my life, and I can have something really major and traumatic happen to me and they don't know about it.\n\nHow rare are those moments? When you feel like you can do something on your own that nobody will know about if you don't want them to.\n\nIt's strange because my life now is really abnormal. I get used to the fact that when I go out, there's gonna be a line of people wanting pictures on their phone, and there's gonna be crowds everywhere, even if there weren't crowds when I walked into a store. I realize the only privacy I'm really entitled to is when I'm in my own apartment or my own home, 'cause everything else is kind of — I'm looked at as sort of public property. And there's nothing I can do about that perception except control my mental perspective on it, which is, I need to treat people well. I need to be grateful. I need to take pictures with people when they ask for one. So if I'm not in the mood to do that, I don't leave my house.\n\nYou also do, in a certain way, make yourself pretty accessible through social media, right? You've been posting Polaroids of your fans holding your new album on your Twitter feed. And you chose fans to invite over to your various homes to have listening parties for the new album — made them cookies, I think? You do have this funny dynamic of bringing people in a very managed way, in a very calculated way, and then having to figure out where the boundary is.\n\nWell, yeah. I like for them to be in situations where they feel they can be themselves. Places they can't be themselves are when they're being pushed up against a barricade and there are thousands of them outside of a talk show, and they're trying to get a picture but they're screaming and everybody's freaking out. They can't necessarily be themselves when they're in these chaotic situations where fans usually find themselves.\n\nI did this thing called the 1989 Secret Sessions a few months ago, way before the album came out. I had spent months picking fans on Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter — people who had been so supportive and had tried and tried to meet me, had been to five shows or however many events but had never met me before. And so I picked these people. And in every single one of my houses in the U.S. and my hotel room in London, I would invite 89 people over to my living room, play them the entire album, tell them the stories behind it. And I'd say, you know, you can share your experience, but please keep the secrets about this album a secret. Let's not talk about lyrics before the album comes out. Let's not talk about song titles. And if you see anybody leaking music, please let us know.\n\nWe spent four hours together each night, taking Polaroids and having a great time and giving them a chance to tell me their stories that they wanted to tell in their own time. Not being rushed. Not having to feel panic. And then they went back out into the world, and they kept those promises. They didn't talk about lyrics. They didn't spoil the secret for other fans. Two days before the album came out, it leaked online, and it was the first time I've ever had an album leak without it trending on Twitter — because my fans protected it. Anytime they'd see an illegal post of it, they'd comment, \"Why are you doing this? Why don't you respect the value of art? Don't do this. We don't believe in this. This is illegal. This isn't fair. This isn't right.\" And it was wild seeing that happen.\n\nWhat do you think other artists could take from that? You are having huge success with this album at a time when a lot of artists can't sell albums to the same extent as they used to.\n\nWell I truly believe in the album. From the start of making one to the time it's finished, I focus on there being a visual theme and emotional DNA to it — including the physical package. I mean there has to be an incentive to go to a store, buy a CD. What people who are forecasting the downfall of the music industry don't think about is that there is a still a huge percentage of the country who drive their kids to school every day and play a CD and listen to it with their kids – there's a CD in the CD player in their car. So I understand that the industry's changing and a lot of people are streaming. However, there are a lot of people who aren't, which is what this release reflects. And so, in the physical CD, we've done an exclusive at Target that has three extra songs. It has three songwriting voice memos from my cell phone that were, you know, the initial rough rough ideas that I had; we put those on the album so people can have insight into the songwriting process. I have five sets of 13 Polaroids from the album photo shoot that are in an envelope in the CD, and depending on what album they get, they'll get a different set of polaroids with lyrics written on the bottom of them. So it's very much an experience that's different than downloading the music itself. It's almost like this kind of collector's edition, the physical copy.\n\nI can imagine other singers listening to this saying, \"You know, that's great for Taylor Swift. She has the resources to do all that. It's great marketing, but it's not art — and the rest of us are on a different playing field. We just can't compete with that.\"\n\nI think that the way that the music industry is changing so quickly, we can learn something from every big release, anything that connects with people. At the end of the day, this is a case by case scenario. If some other artist tries to has the same exact marketing campaign, tries to do secret living room sessions, that's great — if it makes a connection with their fans. If it doesn't make a connection with their fans, then it's not gonna work for them. And I think that what we need to start doing is catering our release plans to our own career, to our own fans, and really get in tune with them. I've been on the internet for hours every single night figuring out what these people want from me. And when it came time to put out an album, I knew exactly what to do.\n\nLet's think back to when your first album came out, when you were 16. You'd moved to Nashville with your parents to try to make this dream of yours come true. You were writing really personal songs about young love and your broken heart. Can you go back to those songs now? I mean, is there any way you can tap into that 16-year-old girl — or even younger, when you wrote them?\n\nI wrote my first album when I was 14 and 15, so now we're going on 10 years of making albums right now. The formula has never changed, in that I try to make an album that best represents the last two years of my life. People have essentially gotten to read my diary for the last 10 years. I still write personal songs, and sometimes people like to put a very irritating, negative, spin on that — as if I'm oversharing, as if it's too much information — when this has been the way I've lived my life and run my career the entire time. So I do think it's really important that I continue to give people an insight into what my life is actually like, even though it comes at a higher cost now.\n\nIf you were to go back and perform one of your earliest songs, a song like \"Tim McGraw,\" say, from your first album, could you connect? Could you go back to the girl who wrote that song as a young teenager?\n\nYes and no. When I do a live show, there are certain songs fans really want to hear, and I'm gonna always play those songs. There's a song called \"Love Story\" that I wrote when I was 17. I'm going to be playing that as long as I'm playing concerts. And I can go back and I can connect to that song — because of the stories I've heard from fans saying, \"We walked down the aisle to that song,\" or how special I feel it was when that was our first No. 1 worldwide hit. But \"Tim McGraw,\" that song I don't really connect to as much. I connect to it in the form of nostalgia, but that was a song about a first love. I'm in a very different place in my life right now, and I think you can only hope to grow so much, emotionally, that you can't necessarily connect to wide-eyed 15-year-old ideas of love anymore.\n\nI've been thinking about that song — I was listening to it today — because it feels to me like \"Wildest Dreams\" is in many ways the 10-years-older version of \"Tim McGraw,\" of telling somebody, \"Look back and remember me this way.\" In that song it's a black dress and in the new song, I think it's a fancy dress.\n\nAbsolutely. I didn't think about that at all. The only difference is that \"Tim McGraw,\" I wrote that song about a relationship that had already ended, hoping that he would remember me well. \"Wildest Dreams\" is about a relationship that is just beginning and already foreshadowing the ending of it.\n\nLike I said, I am the mother of a 12-year-old girl, and she loves your music. Her friends love your music. You have a huge platform among a very vulnerable, impressionable set of the population. And I wonder if you think about turning your lens outward, turning it away from the diary page, and sending a broader message to girls who would be really receptive to hearing about big ideas and the big world that's outside.\n\nLike what kind of messages?\n\nWell, other characters. I don't mean to minimize the effect of a love song or a pop song. But do you ever think about writing about other experiences, things that might turn girls away from themselves in a different way?\n\nThere's nothing that's gonna turn girls away from themselves at age 12. I think that it's really important that I speak about things in interviews that I'm passionate about. I have brought feminism up in every single interview I've done because I think it's important that a girl who's 12 years old understands what that means and knows what it is to label yourself a feminist, knows what it is to be a woman in today's society, in the workplace or in the media or perception. What you should accept from men, what you shouldn't, and how to form your own opinion on that. I think the best thing I can do for them is continue to write songs that do make them think about themselves and analyze how they feel about something and then simplify how they feel. Because, at that age — really at any age, but mostly that age — what can be so overwhelming is that you're feeling so many things at the same time that it's hard to actually understand what those emotions are, so it can turn to anxiety very quickly.\n\nWe are dealing with a huge self-esteem crisis. These girls are able to scroll pictures of the highlight reels of other people's lives, and they're stuck with the behind-the-scenes of their own lives. They wake up and they look at their reflection in the mirror, and they compare it to some filtered, beautiful photo of some girl who's really popular and seems like she has it all together. This is not what you and I had to deal with when we were 12. It's so easy and readily available to compare yourself to others and to feel like you lose.\n\nI'm 24. I still don't feel like it's a priority for me to be cool, edgy, or sexy. When girls feel like they don't fit into those three themes, which are so obnoxiously thrust upon them through the media, I think the best thing I can do for those girls is let them know that this is what my life looks like. I love my life. I've never ever felt edgy, cool, or sexy. Not one time. And that it's not important for them to be those things. It's important for them to be imaginative, intelligent, hardworking, strong, smart, quick-witted, charming. All these things that I think have gone to the bottom of the list of priorities. I think that there are bigger themes I can be explaining to them, and I think I'm trying as hard as I possibly can to do that.\n\nI'm really surprised to hear you say that you never feel cool or edgy or sexy. I mean, you spend a lot of time on red carpets. You go to fashion shows. Those three words don't fit into your view of yourself?\n\nNot at all. I mean, going back to your daughter's age, I think a lot of our self-esteem and self-image is frozen in those formative years. And that was not a time in my life where I felt accepted or invited or like I belonged. And so I've kind of come into my own in that I no longer prioritize feeling those things.\n\nYou mentioned earlier you try to talk about feminism. What does feminism mean to you?\n\nI mean, by my basic definition, it means that you hope for equal rights and opportunities for men and women.\n\nAnd how does that play out in the music world that you're a part of? I mean, do you feel like that's not an issue for you anymore?\n\nIt's an issue every day that I read a headline that says, \"Careful, guys. She'll write a song about you.\" Meanwhile, I have best friends who are male musicians and songwriters, who write songs about their girlfriends and their ex-girlfriends, and that joke is never made about them. As women in public eye, our relationships are tallied up in ways that they aren't for men. And if men have a lot of relationships that are tallied up, it's thought of as mischievous, cheeky. \"Oh he's just out again with another girl.\" It's somehow done with a wink and a smile and for us, and it's supposed to be shameful, if we've had a few relationships that haven't worked out. When I open up a magazine and it says, \"Who's the hotter mama: J-Lo or Beyoncé ?\" You don't see, \"Who's the hotter dad: Matt Damon or Ben Affleck?\" It just doesn't happen. And if we continue this perception that women should be compared to other women and there's a winner and a loser, we're doing ourselves a huge disservice as a society.\n\nTaylor Swift, thanks so much for coming in to talk to us. I appreciate it.\n\nThank you; it's been good to talk to you, too. Tell your daughter hey for me.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Exclusive: Taylor Swift on Being Pop's Instantly Platinum Wonder... And Why She's Paddling Against the Streams - by Chris Willman\n\nLooking at the sales for Taylor Swift's 1989, it would appear that reports of the death of the music industry have been greatly exaggerated. SoundScan reported Tuesday night that Swift's fifth album sold 1.287 million copies in its first week, the highest out-of-the-box bow for any album release since The Eminem Show sold a hair more than that 12 years ago. She now goes down in history as the first artist in history to have three million-selling opening weeks. This would have been impressive even in 1999, when Backstreet Boys walked the pre-Napster earth like lumbering giants. But in 2014? It's like we've just seen a ghost — the ghost of a happy, healthy music biz that can apparently only be summoned by Swift.\n\nSwift was too busy promoting 1989 in Japan this week to immediately toast the sales or critical plaudits. But we caught up with her by transatlantic phone for her first interview since she achieved these fairly stunning figures. Topics of discussion included her unusual DIY marketing ideas… the album's sure-to-be-controversial second single… and a new over-the-counter medicine you might have heard of called Swiftamine.\n\nThere's also that little matter of her having just removed her entire catalog from Spotify, after having previously only withheld new releases from free streaming services. Some news accounts in the business pages have claimed that her label had some secret Machiavellian scheme in mind, but as Swift makes clear here, she's in control of her own business moves as well as her heart.\n\nYAHOO MUSIC: This album had the highest first-week sales since 2002. Then there is also the fact that you're the first artist to have a million-selling week three times in a row. And then there's also just the idea of this being a personal best, just for you. Do any of these ways of looking at the initial success of the album mean more to you than others?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: Well, my huge dream in this whole thing, which I was told many times was an unrealistic… I was told many times to keep my expectations in check, so I did. But the ultimate dream was, \"Can we ring that bell? Can we get a million; can we do this for the third time?\" Because we were all very well aware that if we sold a million records this time, it would be the only time in history that someone had done that three times. That was the most insane thing, when we got the first hint that we might end up actually getting to do it. And then my second biggest hope was, \"Hey, wouldn't it be insane if we topped what we did with Red?\" And then the fans ended up making that happen, so it's been just kind of like a dream scenario all the way around. And I just feel so lucky that people seem to understand what I was doing with this album and loved the new direction of it.\n\nYou put something up on Instagram where you pointed out that some of the so-called experts had initially been projecting it might only sell 650,000. When you heard that back then, were you thinking, \"Oh, come on, guys? This is me, Taylor — you know I can do better than that\"? Or did you ever give in a bit to the diminished expectations of 2014?\n\nWell, I understand there's been a huge shift in this economic landscape, and the perception of music has changed a lot in the last two years. And so when I saw that number that was lower than what we've done before as a prediction, I didn't really know what to expect anymore. Because I hoped that I had created something that people would want to buy, but I didn't know what's been happening in people's minds… I just was hoping and praying that people still perceived there to be a value to someone's musical creation.\n\nThat leads to the streaming question. We've played the game of wondering whether you would have sold hundreds of thousands of fewer copies last week if the album had been available to people for free via those services. To a lot of people, you're a hero for reinforcing that music still has a value. And then there are some people who think you're standing in the way of progress by not giving in to the streaming model. What are your thoughts on all that?\n\nIf I had streamed the new album, it's impossible to try to speculate what would have happened. But all I can say is that music is changing so quickly, and the landscape of the music industry itself is changing so quickly, that everything new, like Spotify, all feels to me a bit like a grand experiment. And I'm not willing to contribute my life's work to an experiment that I don't feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists, and creators of this music. And I just don't agree with perpetuating the perception that music has no value and should be free. I wrote an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal this summer that basically portrayed my views on this. I try to stay really open-minded about things, because I do think it's important to be a part of progress. But I think it's really still up for debate whether this is actual progress, or whether this is taking the word \"music\" out of the music industry. Also, a lot of people were suggesting to me that I try putting new music on Spotify with \"Shake It Off,\" and so I was open-minded about it. I thought, \"I will try this; I'll see how it feels.\" It didn't feel right to me. I felt like I was saying to my fans, \"If you create music someday, if you create a painting someday, someone can just walk into a museum, take it off the wall, rip off a corner off it, and it's theirs now and they don't have to pay for it.\" I didn't like the perception that it was putting forth. And so I decided to change the way I was doing things.\n\nI talked with your dad briefly at your Secret Sessions, and I remember him saying something to the effect of: \"If she's going to be writing op-eds for the Wall Street Journal claiming albums are still commercially viable, she really has something to prove.\" But what is it about the album, per se, for you? There are \"album artists\" — which we usually associate with rock artists — and then singles artists, and you're the rare person who is both. But it's clear that you're a believer in the album. Why worry about selling a million copies of an album when you could just be setting records for selling 5 million of this or that single?\n\nI guess it's just a personal decision from artist to artist. But I'd really much rather write a novel than a bunch of short stories. I'd rather be known for a collection of songs that go together and live together and belong together. These are essentially installments of my life, two years at a time, and I work really hard to make sure that those installments are good enough to also apply to other people's lives in two-year periods of time. Albums defined my childhood, and they've defined my life. I just hope that they will continue to define people in newer generations' lives. I'm so proud of my fans for going out there, over a million strong, and proving that albums still matter to them and that art is still viable to them.\n\n[Related: Taylor Swift and 89 Fans Party Like It's '1989' on New York Rooftop]\n\nIt felt like you were experimenting with your own ideas about marketing, in terms of doing some really untested stuff. You had the Secret Sessions parties, where, paradoxically, it seemed like you were starting a word-of-mouth thing, even though you were swearing people to secrecy. And then calling yourself a social-media lurker and taking that to the furthest extreme as you re-posted things online… Was there anything where you thought, \"Hey, this is kind of a weird way to market an album, but let's just go for it?\"\n\nThey were all ideas that hit me in the middle of the day or in the middle of the night, or in the middle of listening to a new song I'd recorded for 1989. I'd just get these ideas and think, \"What if we did these for the secret society living room sessions? Can we do that? Yeah, of course we can do that.\" We had no idea what was going to happen. And the thing with me posting pictures on Twitter of my fans holding the albums, that was an idea I had five minutes before I did it for the first time. On Tumblr they've been joking for months about how I'm always just lurking around the Internet, stalking their blogs. Predominantly, for the most part, most of these ideas were not thought of in some conference-room marketing meeting.\n\nPeople always talk to you about marriages and relationships, and they say relationships take work, and you have to keep surprising each other. And that I think the most profound relationship I've ever had has been with my fans. That relationship takes work, and you have to continue to think of new ways to delight and surprise them. You can't just assume that because they liked one of your albums, they're going to like the new one, so you can make it exactly the same as you made the last one. You can't just assume that because they were gracious enough to make you a part of their life last year, that they're gonna want to do the same thing this year. I think that core relationship needs to be nurtured. And so there were a lot of things that were brand-new to my career, to my life, and to I guess what you would call the campaign of this album — things we'd never even tried before, but they just felt right because it felt like nurturing that relationship.\n\nIt has to be tough choosing singles off an album where every song sounds like a single. There seems to be an extra degree of fan support for \"Style\" being an eventual single, though.\n\nYeah, I hear that as well. I'm hearing all those things you're hearing.\n\nIs the second single official? There was word it's \"Blank Space.\"\n\nYeah, \"Blank Space.\" The fans tend to decide the singles relatively quickly for us. We don't even need to do much as far as A&R work, because they are very vocal about their favorites. In my mind, I have a very clear picture about singles one, two, three. I'm up in the air about four, but I think that it will present itself just like all the other ones have. It's really exciting to see people have so many favorites and be very, very clear about which ones they think should be singles.\n\n\"Blank Space\" is a particularly provocative choice for a single, because you were already wondering whether people would get that song or not as just an album track. It's such a different kind of lyric for you to put out there. Don't you worry some people will think, \"Wait? Is that really her?\"\n\nIt's interesting when you put out a song with sort of a comedic element to it. People with different senses of humor perceive it differently. You'll have people who completely get the joke and they're saying, \"Oh, look, she's completely taken back the narrative, and she's singing from the perspective of the person the media paints her to be.\" And then other people will be listening to it on the radio and thinking, \"I knew it! I knew she was crazy!\" Just the way this has all kind of shaken out, I did not expect for \"Blank Space\" to be the favorite. And it is the absolute favorite. It's No. 1 on iTunes right now, which is absolutely insane, and \"Shake It Off\" is No. 2.\n\nIt's just so cool to see people like that, because it was sort of a risk for me to even take it into the studio and play this idea for Max Martin and Shellback and say, \"Hey, I want to write this completely satirical song about the fictionalization of my personal life, and just kind of poke fun at it.\" The fact that it ended up being a sort of shining spot on the album is really exciting for me. Because I think it's gonna be really interesting when people see things we have up our sleeve, like the video and other things that I'm really excited about people discovering. It's probably the wildest video I've done.\n\n[Related: Taylor Swift To Debut Performance of 'Blank Space' at 2014 American Music Awards]\n\nYou probably haven't heard about the CMA Awards yet, but Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood had a whole segment about you in their opening monologue. They described your leaving country music behind inducing Post-Partum Taylor Swift Disorder. Supposedly the Democrats lost the midterms because Obama didn't address this. And Brad and Carrie adapted \"Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes\" to be \"Who's Gonna Fill Her Shoes.\"\n\nOh my God. I can't wait to watch that.\n\nBut you have, we know, seen this past weekend's Saturday Night Live sketch about the anxieties that can only be cured with Swiftamine.\n\nOh my God. Swiftamine was amazing. My mom and dad and I were all together watching it, and we were just dying laughing. My favorite part was \"Oooh, Taylor Swift, she's always wearing, like, a 1950s bathing suit.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "BuzzFeed Q&A: Tell Us About Yourself(ie): Taylor Swift\nThe 24-year-old superstar and creator of the biggest-selling album in over a decade takes the BuzzFeed Q&A.\nTaylor Swift is everywhere. Maybe you’ve noticed. Love her or hate her, the trendsetting, genre-bucking, one-woman music industry is impossible to ignore, sparking National Dialog and upending whole economies with her every disarmingly genuine yet astonishingly self-aware move. Hot off the heels of a record-shattering week for her new album 1989, Swift was kind enough to send us a candid self-portrait (classic Taylor Swift Surprised Face™) and answer a few personal questions about the unheralded virtue of the Santa emoji, being held accountable on Tumblr, and an emotional encounter at New York’s most solemn monument.\nWhat’s the wallpaper on your phone right now? A picture of my dad holding my cat, Olivia, like how Simba is held up in The Lion King. She’s giving total side-eye sass because clearly she found the pose to be cliché and beneath her level of sophistication.\nWhat’s one word you’re guilty of using too often? I say “like” way too much and I always start my interview answers with, “I think for me, um…” I think I started doing it as a way to buy a few seconds of time before starting my answer and now it’s really hard to break the habit. My friends on Tumblr have made GIF collages out of it. They don’t let me get away with ANYTHING and I wouldn’t have it any other way.\nWhat’s the last thing you searched for on Google? Pictures of two eagles flying together/being friends. Don’t ask.\nWhat’s in your most frequently used emoji tab?The thumbs up, the wide-eyed surprised-face emoji (go figure), and I think it’s pretty important to send a random Santa emoji to people without any explanation at all. Because he’s always watching.\nWhat’s the first CD you ever bought? LeAnn Rimes’Blue and then Christina Aguilera’s first album was the second. Even back then I struggled with choosing a favorite genre.\nWhat three things are essential for any girls’ night out? 1.) Gum/mints because you’re going to be talking to people/laughing/whispering, so let’s make that experience a good one for everyone involved. 2.) A charged phone because we need Yelp and because “I’m sorry I didn’t meet up with you, my phone died!” is just a made-up excuse we use and not a real thing we let happen. 3.) Red lipstick because we’re going to be loud so our lip color should be too. And if you don’t need a lipstick touch-up at some point, you’re not really living.\nWhich NYC tourist attraction is actually worth the hype? Visiting The World Trade Center Memorial is one of the most life-changing events you can experience. It’s something you should be emotionally prepared for, because it’s so real and honest, just like New York itself. I’llnever forget the moment when I was in the “In Memoriam” room, looking at all of the photos of those who lost their lives that day. The man who had been giving me my tour looked at me and said, “Would you like to see my brother’s picture?”\nWhat’s one thing you know at 24, that you didn’t know at 22? I didn’t realize that being in love with your life can be just as wonderful as being in love with another person. Every relationship takes work and effort, and when I put that work and effort into my friends, family, and fans… my life changed completely. I started making choices based on what I wanted, and didn’t feel like I needed to justify them. If I wanted to cut my hair, I did it. If I wanted to move to New York, I did it. If I wanted to take a spontaneous road trip, I did it. At 24 I decided that my life is enough for me, and I stopped looking for some other piece to complete it. I also learned how to needle-point ironic cross stitches of rap lyrics and gave them to my friends as presents. I’ll let you decide which is the more important revelation.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift on 1989, Spotify, Her Next Tour and Female Role Models\n\nPhotograph by Martin Schoeller for TIME\nBy Jack Dickey November 13, 2014 7:00 AM EST\nTo read all about Taylor Swift’s rise and significance, check out the feature story on the singer in this week’s magazine. But not everything could fit in the story, so here’s the rest of what Swift told TIME. The moment’s most successful recording artist has big theatrics planned for her 2015 tour. And she’s praying for an Iggy Azalea cameo. While she struggles to name a role model in the music industry, she finds herself looking up to Mariska Hargitay, the actress behind Olivia Benson, and Ina Garten, the Barefoot Contessa, these days.\n\nFor the rest of Swift’s thoughts, including why she ditched streaming music service Spotify, how she writes a song and the media’s portrayals of women, here are excerpts from our conversations.\n\nWhy did you leave Spotify? I’m in an office of people who are upset they can’t stream your music.\n\nWell, they can still listen to my music if they get it on iTunes. I’m always up for trying something. And I tried it and I didn’t like the way it felt. I think there should be an inherent value placed on art. I didn’t see that happening, perception-wise, when I put my music on Spotify. Everybody’s complaining about how music sales are shrinking, but nobody’s changing the way they’re doing things. They keep running towards streaming, which is, for the most part, what has been shrinking the numbers of paid album sales.\n\nWith Beats Music and Rhapsody you have to pay for a premium package in order to access my albums. And that places a perception of value on what I’ve created. On Spotify, they don’t have any settings, or any kind of qualifications for who gets what music. I think that people should feel that there is a value to what musicians have created, and that’s that. I wrote about this in July, I wrote an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal. This shouldn’t be news right now. It should have been news in July when I went out and stood up and said I’m against it. And so this is really kind of an old story.\n\nWhat was the goal of your new album, 1989?\n\nWith 1989, I was really putting my neck on the line, because I was the one saying I need to change directions musically. And my label and management were the ones saying “Are you sure, are you positive? This is risky.” And I was the one who had to come back every time and say, “No, this is what we’re doing.” When I put forth an album cover that didn’t have half my face on it, and tried to convince my label that this was the best way to sell an album, you know, I got some kind of interesting side-glance looks. But I knew that this was the best cover to represent this record, because I wanted there to be an air of mystery. I didn’t want people to know the emotional DNA of this album. I didn’t want them to see a smiling picture on the cover and think this was a happy album, or see a sad-looking facial expression and think, oh, this is another breakup record. When I wanted to call the album 1989, people on the team questioned that. Every single element of this album has been called into question, and I’ve had to say “No, this is how we’re doing it.” And the fact that we came out and did the kind of numbers we did in the first week—you have no idea how relieved I was, because it was all on me if this didn’t work. It was a little hard to sleep the night of the album release.\n\nThere’s a song on my album called “All You Had to Do Was Stay.” I was having this dream, that was actually one of those embarrassing dreams, where you’re mortified in the dream, you’re like humiliated. In the dream, my ex had come to the door to beg for me to talk to him or whatever, and I opened up the door and I went to go say, “Hi,” or “What are you doing here?” or something—something normal—but all that came out was this high-pitched singing that said, “Stay!” It was almost operatic. So I wrote this song, and I used that sound in the song. Weird, right? I woke up from the dream, saying the weird part into my phone, figuring I had to include it in something because it was just too strange not to. In pop, it’s fun to play around with little weird noises like that.\n\nI am in love with catchy melodies and hooks that are stuck in your head for days, and ideally weeks, and even months. I really love it when I hear a song, and all of a sudden, my next two weeks are spent trying to figure out how to get that song out of my head. I think there’s a way to artfully do it. I want people to have songs that I write stuck in their heads, but I don’t want it to absolutely perturb them that they have the song stuck in their head. I’m talking about songs that sound like they were cooked up in a lab. Like, anything that makes you think there are eight songwriters on this.\n\nA question about “Shake It Off,” the lead single: I had never read someone saying you stay out too late.\n\nOh, that was just a good first line. Yeah.\n\nWhat does writing a song do for you?\n\nI see a lot of celebrities build up these emotional walls around themselves, where they let no one in, and that’s what makes them feel very lonely at the top. I just keep writing songs. And I kind of stay open to feeling humiliated and rejected, because before being a quote-unquote celebrity, I’m a songwriter. Being a celebrity means you lock your doors and close your windows and don’t let people in. Being a songwriter means you’re very attuned to your own intuition and your own feelings even if they hurt.\n\nSo I approach it much more from a songwriter’s perspective. But I do know how to pull myself out now, from that constant, never-ending, bottomless rabbithole of self-doubt and fear. I’ve been able to write songs and feel better. They clarify and simplify the emotions that you’re feeling. Nothing you do is going to make the pain stop. It just helps to have it clarified and simplified.\n\nIs there someone you look to as a model of where you’d like your career to go? Are there women you look up to?\n\nWe’re taught to find examples for the way we want our lives to wind up. But I can’t find anyone, really, who’s had the same career trajectory as mine. So when I’m in an optimistic place I hope that my life won’t match anyone else’s life trajectory, either, going forward. I do have female role models in the sense of actresses like Mariska Hargitay. I think she has a beautiful life, and an incredible career, and I think she’s built that for herself. She’s one of the highest paid actresses—actors in general, women or men—on television, and she’s been playing this very strong female character for, what, 15 years now, something like that. And Ina Garten, the Barefoot Contessa. I really love her business, and how she sticks to who she is, and how people relate to it. In other industries, I have female role models. I just struggle to find a woman in music who hasn’t been completely picked apart by the media, or scrutinized and criticized for aging, or criticized for fighting aging—it just seems to be much more difficult to be a woman in music and to grow older. I just really hope that I will choose to do it as gracefully as possible.\n\nIs it a struggle, being a role model for so many young women while trying to produce something artistically valid?\n\nI don’t find a struggle with that balance, being looked at as a role model, because I think it’s a very obvious and natural thing for people to see you as, when you’re a singer. I’ve always felt very comfortable with it, for some reason. That in particular hasn’t been one of my struggles. I’ve struggled with a lot of things, but the idea that you’re living your life and it’s impacting other people, some of whom are very young, some of whom are in their most impressionable times and they’re discovering the music that tells them how they are going to live their lives and how they should feel and how it’s acceptable to feel, I think that that’s kind of exciting.\n\nBut it’s the same thing as living your life based on what your grandkids will say one day. I’m sure there will be things that my grandkids make fun of me for no matter what, but I’d really rather it be, “Look how awkward your dancing was in the ‘Shake It Off’ video! You look so weird, Grandma!” rather than “Grandma, is that your nipple?” I don’t make it as much about the millions of people who would be disappointed if I were to have some sort of meltdown or scandal or something that made everyone feel like my character wasn’t what they thought it was. I think more about the people in my life that would disappoint: my mom, my dad, my kids, if I ever have them. And that way it’s not as much pressure as thinking about the millions of little minds that you must be shaping. I’m trying to live my life with some sort of thoughtfulness put into my actions, but it’s not because I feel like I’m the president of the International Babysitters Club.\n\nDoes it annoy you when people say you don’t write your own songs, or that someone else is pulling the strings of your career?\n\nI haven’t heard any of the people I respect in the music industry or in journalism, saying that they think I don’t write my own songs. I think, when I put out Speak Now, which was my third album, and I decided I was just going to write it entirely on my own, to me that was enough of a statement. I felt like I could move on from that. I felt like I had proved my point. That was when I felt free to collaborate with whoever I wanted, because if you actually listen to the music, you can tell that the lyrics are written by the same person. And it’s not a ghostwriter. It’s not some weird, you know—everyone’s got those weird Shakespeare theories that someone else did all his stuff for him. Not to ever compare yourself to Shakespeare. But people need to poke holes in things because of their own stuff. It’s not about me.\n\nAnd we all know it’s a feminist issue. My friend Ed [Sheeran], no one questions whether he writes everything. In the beginning, I liked to think that we were all on the same playing field. And then it became pretty obvious to me that when you have people sort of questioning the validity of a female songwriter, or making it seem like it’s somehow unacceptable to write songs about your real emotions—that it somehow makes you irrational and overemotional—seeing that over the years changed my view. It’s a little discouraging that females have to work so much harder to prove that they do their own things. I see Nicki Minaj and Iggy Azalea having to prove that they write their own raps or their own lyrics, and it makes me sad, because they shouldn’t have to justify it.\n\nAs a female celebrity, having your body picked over, in a way that doesn’t happen for male celebrities—how do you deal?\n\nI refuse to buy into these comparisons, because you don’t see it happening to men. All you seem to see is “Which New Mother Is Sexier?” “Who’s the Hotter Mama?” “Who’s Got The Better Booty?” If we continue to show young girls that they are being compared to other girls, we’re doing ourselves a huge disservice as a society. I surround myself with smart, beautiful, passionate, driven, ambitious women. Other women who are killing it should motivate you, thrill you, challenge you and inspire you rather than threaten you and make you feel like you’re immediately being compared to them. The only thing I compare myself to is me, two years ago, or me one year ago. How does 1989 measure up to Red, sales-wise? You just try to lead by example, and you hope, someday, that if we talk about feminism enough, maybe we’ll start to actually see it make a difference in the way young girls perceive themselves and each other.\n\nDoes it annoy you to have photographers everywhere you go? Are you at risk of becoming a shut-in?\n\nYeah, every outing is documented. So any outing I’ve been on, you’ve seen photos of. Any other time, I’m at home. Or I have my friends over and we cook dinner and talk and sit on the roof and laugh about things and gossip and whatever.\n\nIt’s honestly like, if I’m in the mood to be held accountable for every single article of clothing on my body, and whether it matches, and if it clashes, and if it’s on trend, then I go out. But if I’m not interested in undergoing that kind of debate and conversation—regarding how I’m walking, whether I look tired, how my makeup is right, what’s that mark on my knee, did you hurt yourself?—I just don’t go out. I try to evaluate whether I’m in the right emotional space to deal with that, and if I’m not, then I just stay in. And I’m perfectly happy staying in.\n\nWhat do you have planned for the tour?\n\nI know that with the way the fans have latched onto this album, the setlist will be predominantly songs from 1989. You know, when I go back and play songs I know they want to hear, like “Love Story” or “Trouble,” it’ll be interesting to reimagine them so that the fans get a new experience that feels in keeping with 1989. But I’m so excited. I have so many things I’ve been dreaming up for this.\n\nIf you look at the makeup of my previous music, as far as production elements go, there are a lot of live drums, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and live bass. And if you look at the landscape of 1989, it’s mostly synths and automated drums and these kind of big epic synth pad sounds, and key bass, and layered vocals. I have a very big band, there are, what, 14 of us, so what you’re going to end up with is more of a live feel in that it’s going to be filled in and more dramatic with more layers to it, but never to the point where it’s going to feel noisy or overcrowded. The music on this tour is going to live a little bit in that world, and thank God, my fans really seem to like that world.\n\nThe challenge with a stadium show is making those people in the very top row feel like they got an intimate, personal experience. On the Red tour we achieved that sense of intimacy by having acoustic moments, and moments where I was telling stories about these songs. I don’t like to scream at the audience, I like to talk to them.\n\nI really like for there to be something theatrical about what we do on stage. When I was younger, I was just obsessed with Broadway shows. As much as I can show these audiences an element of that theatrical nature to a performance, I think that it allows them to escape from their lives a little bit more. So when you have a show like that it’s very difficult to change up the setlist every night. I keep the setlist pretty much intact, but we have little variables—I usually do different acoustic songs every night. In the past, I have brought out dozens of guest artists not to perform my songs but to perform their songs and I’ll take a verse. And those are the things that make me the happiest, because the reality of the situation is that most of the kids in the audience have YouTubed the entire concert before they got there. They know exactly what’s going to happen next unless I call up another artist and have a secret rehearsal soundcheck and surprise the crowd with something they genuinely weren’t expecting. I should be getting on that now, look into a booking agent for these things.\n\nBut it’s worth it because I really want them to have that genuine moment of surprise. It’s very rare in this day and age to surprise people, but I really like doing it.\n\nDo you have a dream onstage guest?\n\nI love Iggy Azalea, I love Haim. I’d say Vance Joy, but he’s opening up the tour, so he’ll be there anyway. The things that I try to really focus on when bringing out people as surprise guests is what do my fans really want to see, what would they lose their minds over? Not to show too many of my cards here—but I have probably 10 guests that I’m thinking about that would be amazing. But you know, these have to be artists that would get up there and play for the love of playing, because they’re not paid for being there, and they usually have to switch up their schedules. The people who have done it in the past—it’s been astonishing to me, because it’s been Nicki Minaj, and Usher, and T.I., these huge artists who could be anywhere else. And you can tell who loves playing live if they’re willing to come and play for free on one of my stadium shows.\n\nIs there a singular moment from touring that sent your endorphin levels higher than they’d ever been before?\n\nThere are moments that happen live where you get to see humanity do what they’re going to do, and you can’t ever anticipate what they’re going to do. I played a stadium right outside of Boston a couple years ago. It was outdoor, perfect, clear weather forecast. And in the middle of the show, a torrential downpour starts. In my head, the first thing I’m thinking is, Everyone’s going to leave. We’re seven songs into this show, and they’re going to leave. I’m going to be playing to no one. And it’s going to look just like my nightmares look. But instead of leaving, they just danced. They all danced in the rain together, and I still, years later, have people come up to me in public, at some restaurant or wherever they run into me, and they’ll say, “I was at the show where it rained. I was at the Rain Show.” And I know exactly what they’re talking about, because we have these moments and these memories that bond us, like the time I looked out there and saw everyone dancing, when it was the complete opposite of what I thought they were going to do, and it’s those moments of human interaction that happen on tour that you can’t get just watching a song climb the charts, sitting in your house.\n\nYou recently moved to New York. Are you a Knicks fan now?\n\nYeah, totally.\n\nYou realize they’re not very good.\n\nI love them, though. Why does that matter? So you run into a bunch of different, interesting types of people at the Met Ball. I’ve gone the last four years. And the most normal people at that event, every single time, are Amar’e Stoudemire and his wife Alexis. I talk with them and hang with them every time I’m there. So I’ve always had this sort of love of the Knicks, just because Amar’e is so cool. And also I performed at the Knicks’—at Madison Square Garden’s—Kids Talent Competition at halftime when I was 12 or 13. And ever since then I’ve had this kind of sparkly, magical opinion of Madison Square Garden and the Knicks, since they let me sing when I was a little kid.\n\nCondensed and edited from separate interviews in September and November.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Wonderland Cover Story: Taylor Swift\nWith a bold new synthpop sound and opinions on love, loss and martyrdom, country girl turned chart-stomping industrialist Taylor Swift is back. Just don’t mention Twitter trolls.\n\nI don’t know about you, but Taylor Swift is feeling 24. If Tay at 22 was, as her slumber party anthem goes, “happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time”, this year she’s clearer of mind: strong, sceptical, indie and willingly off the market. “RIP me!” she yawped recently to Graham Norton, and she wasn’t kidding. 1989, her fifth album released in late October, demands that you forget all you know about the Pennsylvanian. Early signs that she was out of love and liking it popped up on her Instagram feed six months ago. “There are far better things ahead than any we have left behind,” goes the CS Lewis quote she blogged. Then, in an interview with The Guardian in August, the country-pop crossover came clean. “[Having a relationship] isn’t really possible right now. It just doesn’t seem like a possibility in the near future. It doesn’t ever work.”\n\nSwift – whose lovably goofy Colgate grin and Appalachian drawl make her the tween dream to take home to your parents – isn’t exactly intimidating, but she’s tougher in person than you’d expect. There’s an emotional grit to her new songs that may surprise the legions of fans who scream and cry along to “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” on Vlogs and dissect Tay’s lyrics for relationship advice. The message in lead single “Shake It Off” is pretty clear: stop being a dick on Twitter. “Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break. And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake. Baby, I’m just gonna shake it off,” chants Swift, pleading for the demise of social media trolls and take-down tormentors.\n\nGliding towards me with a puppet-like weightlessness, the singer balances a latte on the flat of her hand. “Twitter’s dark underbelly is that it gives people a veil of anonymity: they can have a terrible day at work, and feel awful about themselves, and then come home and get drunk and call someone ugly on Instagram,” she laments. “If people don’t have anyone to talk to about [their problems], they go online and just say wicked, gross, cruel, mean-spirited things about people. I wrote ‘Shake It Off’ for my own situation, but also for the situation that everyone finds themselves in now. It’s not a celebrity issue, it’s a people issue.”\n\nElsewhere, the album’s closer “Clean”, co-written by Imogen Heap, is a true-blue confessional about the lingering hurt of a shattered relationship. Swift tells me its parting shot, “Ten months sober, I won’t give in, now that I’m clean, I’m never going to risk it” is her top lyric on the record. It’s a tantalising analogy about heartache and the single life. Compare it to her favourite moment from Red —- “You call me up again just to break me like a promise” sung on the Jake Gyllenhaal break-up anthem, “All Too Well” — and it’s clear Swift is feeling decisive.\n\n“I’ve been with myself for so long now, I like it,” admits the singer, who’s also been linked with John Mayer, Taylor Lautner and Joe Jonas in the past. “I’m not willing to give up that independence for anyone. Basically, there’s the tiniest, tiniest, tiniest chance you might find someone you can have a real and long-lasting relationship with. In my teenage years, I was enamoured by the idea of romance because I thought it was going to be this ‘happily ever after’ situation. Wait!” she says, as if to skewer our tense start, “is that my damned hat my publicist is wearing? She looks great in it!”\n\nIf a little emotionally damaged, sonically 1989 is anything but difficult. In fact, Swift has discussed her fear of the “tricky” fifth album. In her eyes, many artists reach a stage in their career where textures and otherworldliness replace focused melodies and heartfelt messages. “Samples and beat-dropping and pointless collaborations…, there are a lot of different ways that you can get distracted from the fact that people just want to listen to a good song,” she says. Don’t expect any build and drop action — modern pop’s dire signature move. Instead, 1989 references the whip-crack productions of 80s maestros Phil Collins, Giorgio Moroder and The Human League, rather than towing the line.\n\nCo-producer Jack Antonoff’s skittering beatwork for “Out of The Woods” — a paean to broken kinship that many have said nods to her fling with Harry Styles — is a million miles from any of RedOne’s or Stargate’s tired, floor-ready recitals. For millennials who spent their uni days stealing snogs at 80s nights, the bold, massive, marching drum-led tune will ring loud. Then there’s brilliant opener “Welcome To New York”, where droning “Electric Dreams”-esque synths meet calls to “dance to a new soundtrack…”, to “dance to this beat forevermore.”\n\nBut Pro-Tools pop hasn’t always done it for Swift, whose self-titled 2006 debut, and follow-up Fearless, introduced Gen Y to her spur rattlin’, straw gnawin’ tunethems. Sweet as cherry pie, those early albums evoked a romanticised, provincial America, where neighbourhood crushes and chords stood in for STDs and speeding cars. Rounding up hordes of accolades — including a Grammy for Album of the Year, Fearless remains the most awarded album in country music history, and added to the singer’s towering 200+ trophy count.\n\nThe moment Swift introduced 1989 as her “very first documented, official pop album” and swapped crocodile shoes for a snapback in the video for “Shake It Off”, all heck broke loose. “And sorry Country Music Hall of Fame,” ranted SavingCountryMusic.com, “but your education wing is forever named after a pop star who has officially featured twerking asses in one of her videos.” In a Rolling Stone piece, Scott Borchetta, CEO at record label Big Machine, predicted country radio stations won’t “keep playing a pop song simply because it’s her [anymore]” And the reality? The song wedged a solid entry in Billboard’s Country Airplay charts on its August release. “This was sort of the final phase of the sonic evolution I feel I’ve been on for the last couple of years,” she explains. “I’ve been experimenting with pop sensibilities and then on my last record [2012’s Red], I got attached to it. That’s the wonderful thing about trying as many different ways of writing music as possible; discoveries.”\n\nOn a recent Reddit thread about “Shake It Off”, one fan theorised that Swift releases singles merely to draw people in, and that the album’s nectar — the sweet, honest and deliciously composed lullabies she’s known for — is found within. She agrees, and isn’t surprised by the depth of analysis. Notoriously, Swiftian Fundamentalists spend hours unpicking Tay’s liner notes for hidden messages and themes. Scan through Red’s title track and recurring letters “S.A.G” are a nod, fans claim, to Sagittarius, Gyllenhaal’s star sign. 1989, Swift says, is just as cryptic. “I think people want art to have layers,” she says. “I think that they want to know that there’s a meaning and a story and a cast of characters behind a song. I think they want a visual reference, they want to know that there are secrets that they have the option of figuring out.” Thank The Dixie Chicks, one of the singer’s childhood crushes, for this. Their 1999 album Fly is packed with imagery, codes and motifs. “In the artwork, they were dressed up like flies,” she remembers. “In another, the band were on rockets. I just thought it was cool that they had a visual theme, and things like that inspired me to make sure that each album has its own specific look and vibe.”\n\nThe album’s deluxe version comes with original voice memos, revealing a slightly croaky-voiced Swift recording ideas in the middle of the night. You can hear a bare bones version of ballad “I Know Places”, later sent to collaborator Ryan Tedder of One Republic. “You can hear me talking to him on it,” chuckles Swift. “’Hey Ryan, if you don’t like it that’s totally fine, I’ll just send you something else. But I want to write a song about us against the world — everybody’s trying to figure us out and we have to keep it secret.’”\n\nThere were early signs that 1989 was Swift’s most anticipated record to date, and that the songstress only had to sneeze and she had a hit on her hands. On October 21, Universal launched a new song titled “Track 3”, but the file was corrupted. The release came out as eight seconds of white noise, but it rocketed to the top of the Canadian iTunes Charts anyway. Was this Swift’s radical, abortive new direction? Was she the next Merzbow? Fans, it seems, will stand by her through anything. In a year where no artist has sold over a million records, Billboard anticipated 1989 would shift 800,000 in its first week.\n\nOf course, martyrdom has its pitfalls. In May 2013, a man was arrested after clambering out of the Atlantic ocean claiming he had swum two miles to get to Swift’s home in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. Then, back in February, a follower tore onstage during a show at London’s O2 arena to pass his queen seraph a note. A fan-shot video of the incident is terrifying to watch, but close-up snaps show a calm and smiling star accept the gesture. “Oh, I’ve got a whole file full of creepy guy stories,” she laughs. “I think the thing that scares me a little is that they honestly don’t know that they’re acting out of line. They don’t understand that kidnapping me would be inappropriate and something I might not enjoy. It’s not like they think, ‘If I’m locked out of the gate outside her house, it means I’m not invited.’ It’s more like, ‘I need to climb over the shrubbery.’”\n\nIn dealing with awkward confrontations, Swift is the pop world’s doyenne. Since teenhood, she’s surfed board meetings with middle aged label heads and been doted upon by pruned country music patrons. Growing up on a Christmas tree farm in The Cumru Township in Pennsylvania, as a pre-teen she penned a song for a Maybelline project and travelled to Nashville to hand out demos around the famous Music Row, an area home to swarms of record companies. A year down the line, the Swift family upped and moved to rural Tennessee to explore their daughter’s growing potential. A publishing deal with Sony came shortly after.\n\nThese days, between hanging with full time ride-or-dies Lorde, Ed Sheeran and Lena Dunham (who DMd her on Twitter to ask, “Can we be friends?”), she’s trying her hand at acting. 2009’s debut screen stint was as troubled-teen-turned-murder-victim Hayley Jones in CSI, and her part as Elaine in last year’s Fox series New Girl saw Swift hook up with Satya Bhabha’s character on his wedding day. This year she stars, albeit briefly, in The Giver alongside Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges. “The producers approached me about the role backstage after a show,” she explains. “They’d watched my performance of ‘All Too Well’ at the Grammys, and said that it was the exact emotion they were looking for. Openness and vulnerability, I guess.”\n\nRumours of between-takes jam sessions with her co-stars started circulating in August. Picture it: you can almost smell the rum from Streep’s glass as she croons through “Freebird” to Swift’s dulcet Wurlitzer. In the corner, Bridges and cohorts Brenton Thwaites, Cameron Monaghan and Alexander Skarsgård swill their tumblers on barber shop quartet-duty. How raucous did it get? “Wouldn’t you like to know?” Swift jabs playfully, rocking a poker face so unbroken you can hear the bubbles fizz in her mug. “You’re so nosy over there. You know what the headline would be if I were to admit to that…. Wouldn’t that be a good quote?” Just when I thought I might actually be getting a bollocking, Tay runs for her phone to show me a picture of her cat. “Look,” she yelps. “It’s so long!”\n\nI like the feel of this dogged, righteous new Taylor Swift. On 1989, all the clues are there. It’s the story of a girl who grew up, who finally found herself, who forgot all she knew and made something of it. The record’s nostalgia-flavoured fables of self-reliance, regrettable memories, and nights in the ditch looking up at the stars aren’t songs of sadness, they’re building blocks. “I could build a castle out of the bricks they threw at me,” read a scribbled note on Instragram on October 26. “@Taylorswift. Born in 1989.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Billboard Woman of the Year Taylor Swift on Writing Her Own Rules, Not Becoming a Cliche and the Hurdle of Going Pop\nTaylor Swift never doubted that her fifth album, '1989,' would sell 1 million copies in its first week. But others were not so confident. \"Everyone, in and out of the music business, kept telling me…\n\nTaylor Swift never doubted that her fifth album, 1989, would sell 1 million copies in its first week. But others were not so confident. “Everyone, in and out of the music business, kept telling me that my opinion and my viewpoint was naive and overly optimistic — even my own label,” says Swift, recalling the run-up to 1989‘s October release in the vast living room of her penthouse loft in downtown Manhattan. “But when we got those first-day numbers in, all of a sudden, I didn’t look so naive anymore.”\n\nIn fact, 1989 moved 1.29 million copies in its first week, the biggest seven-day sales of any release since 2002, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Swift, who turns 25 on Dec. 13, became the first artist to hit that 1 million-week milestone three times — breaking a record not just for women or twentysomethings, but all musicians. It was an accomplishment that she engineered, maintaining worldwide ubiquity throughout 2014 with the European and Asian legs of her $150 million-earning Red Tour, a savvy and accessible social media presence, and tireless promotion, taking on everything from TV appearances to a role as New York’s “global welcome ambassador.” And as she made the leap from country to pop, her fans stuck by her, eager to follow an idol charting her own course.\n\nSwift asserted her freedom and influence more than ever in 2014, including moving from Nashville to New York’s chic Tribeca neighborhood and pulling her music from Spotify, which led to widespread debate over streaming and compensation for artists. She also revealed a burgeoning feminist consciousness, delivering an impassioned defense of actress Emma Watson’s speech at the United Nations about gender equality and assembling a social circle of strong young women including Lorde, Karlie Kloss and Lena Dunham. “Taylor is like this force of protective energy,” says Lorde. “She looks after everyone she knows. We’re both interested and involved in the workings of the industry. I have this thing in my head that she should do seminars — ‘Swift’s 13 Steps’ or something.”\n\nSwift was raised in Wyomissing, Pa., the daughter of Scott Kingsley Swift, a financial adviser, and Andrea Finlay, a former marketing executive. The family, including her younger brother Austin, relocated to Nashville when Swift was 14 so she could pursue her musical ambitions. “Working in those writers’ rooms,” she says, in between sips from a Starbucks cup, “writing several songs a day with several sets of collaborators, it teaches you discipline.” Since the release of her 2006 debut, Taylor Swift, she has won seven Grammy Awards and has sold more than 30 million albums and almost 80 million song downloads worldwide, according to her record company, Big Machine Label Group.\n\nStill, given today’s music business climate, BMLG president/CEO Scott Borchetta admits that it was tough to gauge realistic expectations for 1989. “When you have the entire industry saying, ‘Well, it might only be 800,000, but that’s a great number,’ you start to question if the market could bear it,” he says. “My job is to make sure she had all the information.” And Swift’s job, of course, is to push past all that. Says Borchetta: “I learned a long time ago: Don’t ever doubt the power of Taylor Swift.”\n\nThere has been so much talk about you moving to New York, but people forget that you grew up in Pennsylvania, just a few hours away.\n\nOh, yeah — people have no idea! I summered at the Jersey Shore every year. When I first discovered that I was in love with performing, I wanted to be in theater. So growing up, New York City was where I would come for auditions. I was 10, but I was as tall as a 16-year-old, and then you’d have a 22-year-old who could play 10, and they’d get the role. Then I started taking voice lessons in the city, so my mom and I would drive two hours and have these adventures.\n\nI went to a Knicks game a few weeks ago, and people were like, “Oh, it’s your first Knicks game!” I actually have a photo of my first Knicks game. I was 12 years old and I was in a halftime talent competition, but I didn’t win because the kid who won sang “New York, New York,” and I was like, “Here’s a song I wrote about a boy in my class …”\n\nYou have been criticized for the tone of the 1989 song “Welcome to New York.” Has it made you think any differently, hearing people say that this is a difficult time to afford to live in the city?\n\nAbsolutely. But when you write a song, you’re writing about a momentary emotion. If you can capture that and turn it into three-and-half minutes that feel like that emotion, that’s all you’re trying to do as a songwriter. To take a song and try to apply it to every situation everyone is going through — economically, politically, in an entire metropolitan area — is asking a little much of a piece of a music.\n\nI’m as optimistic and enthusiastic about New York as I am about the state of the music industry, and a lot of people aren’t optimistic about those two things. And if they’re not in that place in their life, they’re not going to relate to what I have to say.\n\nIt must be a challenge for you to move around, even in this city. Do you have favorite places to go or things to do?\n\nThe only places I can’t really go are huge carnival-type things, where there could be some sort of stampede. It’s happened before. Which sucks, because I love carnivals, and I love fairs. I have a hard time accepting the fact that my life is abnormal. I admit it now, but I’m not going to stop grocery shopping just because it tends to be a very hectic situation. If I ever have a family, that’s when I would start to think about the inconvenience of it — if I had to explain to a 4-year-old why all those men are pointing cameras at us and why people are staring. At this point, I can handle it because it’s just me, and my friends are really good about it, too. If I had friends who made me feel bad about it, I’d feel like I was a burden to them.\n\nHow did the decision crystallize to make 1989 a pop record?\n\nMax Martin and [Karl Johan] Shellback [Schuster] were the last people I collaborated with on [2012 album] Red, and I wished we could have done more and explored more. So going into this album, I knew that I wanted to start with them again. Then I thought, “Wouldn’t it be amazing to work with Ryan Tedder?” And then I was with Jack Antonoff and Lena Dunham at the beach, and we started talking about our favorite ’80s music. All of this started happening organically, and I found myself gravitating toward pop sensibilities, pop hooks, pop production styles.\n\nWhen I knew the album had hit its stride, I went to Scott Borchetta and said, “I have to be honest with you: I did not make a country album. I did not make any semblance of a country album.” And of course he went into a state of semi-panic and went through all the stages of grief — the pleading, the denial. “Can you give me three country songs? Can we put a fiddle on ‘Shake it Off’?” And all my answers were a very firm “no,” because it felt disingenuous to try to exploit two genres when your album falls in only one. I never want to pull the wool over people’s eyes, because people are so much smarter than a lot of marketing professionals give them credit for.\n\nSo what did that mean at the writing level?\n\nThis was just me following where I’ve been headed for years. “I Knew You Were Trouble” was a big signal flare. When I did something like that, that I thought people were going to be freaked out over, and it ended up spending seven weeks at No. 1 on the pop charts, it felt like I had tried on something new that fit really well. So for this album I decided, “Hey, that thing I tried last time? I’m going to make my whole wardrobe into that.”\n\nWhat was your working relationship with Max Martin, who is credited as the album’s co-executive producer?\n\nHe doesn’t do interviews, so people create this Wizard of Oz-type persona because he’s seemingly so mysterious. But if you get in a room with him, he’s absolutely warm and kind and funny, and honestly, out of the goodness of his heart did so much extra work on this album and never asked to be named anything. I started to experiment and work with other people, and Max knew that I wanted to make an album, not a collection of songs that sound like they’re recorded in different studios by different people. So he volunteered to record pretty much all the vocals — even things he didn’t write or produce. He would come in and spend his day away from his kid, away from his wife, and volunteer his time and not ask for anything. And the more that he did that, the more I realized that he deserved credit for that. That’s what made him feel to me like co-executive producer.\n\nDid you want “Shake It Off” as the first single for the sound or for the message?\n\nBoth. This album is not about boys. It’s not about something trivial; it’s not about revenge or breakups. It’s about what my life looks like now. And that song is essentially written about an important lesson I learned that really changed how I live my life and how I look at my life. I really wanted it to be a song that made people want to get up and dance at a wedding reception from the first drum beat. But I also wanted it to be a song that could help someone get through something really terrible, if they wanted to focus on the emotional profile, on the lyrics. Because I’ve had people say things to me like, “When my mom died, I listened to this every single day to help me get out of bed.” And then I’ve had people say, “I danced to this drunk at a wedding reception.” If they want to forget about the lyrics, they can, but if they want to hang on every word, they can do that, too.\n\nBilly Joel recently said that one reason he stopped writing songs was because people started reading too much of his personal life into his lyrics. Has the way everyone plays connect the dots with your songs become a hindrance to your writing?\n\nI’ve been dealing with it for so many years now that I expect the media to do it, I expect fans to do it. Human curiosity is never to be underestimated. But I don’t have anyone whose feelings are on the line except for me. If I was in love with someone right now, I don’t know how I would handle everyone else weighing in on our stories, because when you’re in a relationship there are a lot of secrets and a lot of sacred moments that you don’t want to divulge. I, however, am 24, perfectly happy being alone, and one of the reasons I’m perfectly happy being alone is that no one gets hurt this way.\n\nWhat was your biggest challenge this year?\n\nConvincing members of my team that [the pop move] was a good call. People seem to love the album, and we’re all high-fiving each other, but I remember all the sit-downs in the conference rooms, where I would get kind of called in front of a group of people who have worked with me for years. They said, “Are you really sure you want to do this? Are you sure you want to call the album 1989? We think it’s a weird title. Are you sure you want to put an album cover out that has less than half of your face on it? Are you positive that you want to take a genre that you cemented yourself in, and switch to one that you are a newcomer to?”\n\nAnd answering all of those questions with “Yes, I’m sure” really frustrated me at the time — like, “Guys, don’t you understand, this is what I’m dying to do?” The biggest struggle turned into the biggest triumph when it worked out.\n\nYou have assembled this salon of really famous women around you — Lorde and Lena and Karlie. How did you build this posse?\n\nEvery one of my friendships has a unique and odd beginning. I was watching Girls and I thought, “How mind-blowing is it that this girl is writing, directing and acting in this incredibly profound, raw, authentic view of being a woman in your mid-20s?” So I went to Lena’s Twitter and she was following me. I saw her quoting my lyrics. At first I was afraid, because I thought she was being ironic or making fun of me. Then I looked down further and she’s talking about my music all the time. So I followed her, and immediately got a direct message back saying, “When can we hang out? We need to be best friends.”\n\nWith Ella — Lorde — her album came out and I thought it was amazing, so I sent her flowers and congratulated her on a great first week. And I get this text message from one of our mutual friends, [Rookie editor/actress] Tavi Gevinson, and she says, “Lorde is freaking out because she said some stuff about you in an interview and she feels so terrible.” She essentially had said that I’m too perfect or something like that — something that did not even mildly offend me, that I thought was cute. She felt so bad about it, so I said, “It’s no big deal. We should hang out sometime.” We met up in New York and walked to a park near my hotel, and we ate Shake Shack burgers and got attacked by monster squirrels who wanted our food. I could keep going — Karlie and I met at the Victoria’s Secret show …\n\nDid you set out to gather these strong females around you? How much is accidental and how much is it because it was the right moment for that?\n\nI never thought too hard about it, but you’ll notice a lot of celebrity-type people tend to surround themselves with people whose lives revolve around them. You’ll have a posse of these exciting and fashionable cling-ons, and it’s because those celebrities need to be fawned over.\n\nI feel uncomfortable being the No. 1 priority in my friends’ lives — I want to be there to make their lives more fun, if they need to talk, to be there for spontaneous and exciting adventures, but I don’t want friends who don’t have a life outside of me. So whether it’s Karlie, who loves what she does in fashion, or Lily Aldridge or Lena or my [childhood] friend Abigail, whose job is making sure that veterans get their compensation checks, the one thing they all have in common is that they love what they do. They have me in their life because they want me in their life, not because they gain from it.\n\nYour mom has been central to your work and your life. Between moving here and meeting all these accomplished women, has that relationship changed at all?\n\nMy mom has allowed me to grow up one year at a time. She was very protective when I was a teenager, when every other person would say to us, “Are you going to become a trainwreck? When are we going to see you going off the rails like …,” and then they would name these other girls that they perceived to be trainwrecks, which was lovely. So it wasn’t just “Don’t drink until you’re 21,” it was “Don’t be seen holding a glass that they could think alcohol is in.”\n\nEverybody wanted me to become a cliche. And I wasn’t going to let it happen, and my family wasn’t going to let it happen. And now I’m allowed to be 24, almost 25, which is nice.\n\nWhich websites do you read most often?\n\nNo. 1 one is Tumblr, because it allows me to experience my fans’ sense of humor. They’re sharing not only stories but also GIFs and memes that they’ve created.\n\nI love Buzzfeed, because they do a really good job of making news funny, or making a complete news story out of a non-news item. Like how I carry my purse in the crook of my arm, and they’ll do a slideshow on it. Somehow they come up with these random things to write about that are highly entertaining.\n\nYou’re coming off of your third million-selling week. Now that you’re really only competing against yourself, do you see a time when you’ll step away from trying to go bigger every time out?\n\nI have no idea what’s going to happen to me, that’s the thing. I was really hoping that we could convince people to go out and make 1989 a part of their lives, and that maybe a million people would want to do that. And essentially, my fans wanted to make a statement about music, too. Because they read my op-ed piece, and it was sort of an unspoken pact between us. They proved that they still want to invest in music, that it’s important enough to spend their hard-earned money on.\n\nTaylor Swift Talks Female Role Models, Aging Gracefully & Her (Eventual) Grandkids in ‘Time’\n\nDoes it still feel like a struggle to get the acknowledgment for your own work? Even Imogen Heap, who worked with you on the album, wrote on her blog that she had “assumed Taylor didn’t write too much of her own music … and was likely puppeteered by an aging gang of music executives.”\n\nEveryone’s got their own relationships and dramas, so they don’t have time to create a complex opinion of every celebrity. Do I get offended when people don’t fully understand how much of the workload is done by me? No, they’re busy with their own lives. If someone has studied my catalog and still doesn’t think I’m behind it, there’s nothing I can do for that person. They may have to deal with their own sexist issues, because if I were a guy and you were to look at my catalog and my lyrics, you would not wonder if I was the person behind it.\n\nWhen I’m in a room with a writer for the first time, and I bring in 10 to 15 nearly finished songs as my ideas, I think they know that I’m not expecting anyone to do the work for me. I’m not going to be one of those artists who walks in and says, “I don’t know, what do you want to write about?” or one of those things where they say, “So what’s going on in your life?,” and I tell them and then they have to write a song about it. I wouldn’t be a singer if I weren’t a songwriter. I have no interest in singing someone else’s words.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Go Behind TIME’s Taylor Swift Cover With Photographer Martin Schoeller\n2 minute read\n\nBy Richard Conway November 13, 2014 3:49 PM EST\nFor this week’s issue of TIME, photographer Martin Schoeller traveled from New York to photograph Taylor Swift for our cover. The location? Forest Hills, Tennessee near the star’s adopted base of Nashville. The studio? Swift’s family home.\n\n“I wanted to show her in an unexpected light,” Schoeller tells TIME. “We are used to seeing her portrayed a certain way, quite ‘pop-like’. I wanted her to come across a bit differently.”\n\nTaylor Swift photographed playing the piano at her parents home in Forest Hills, Tennessee on September 29, 2014.\nTaylor Swift photographed playing the piano at her parents' home in Forest Hills, Tennessee on September 29, 2014.Martin Schoeller for TIME\nSo for the cover, Schoeller made one of his signature “close up” style images: tight framing, brightly lit. In the resulting image we see the pop star in a new light, up close and straight on.\n\nThe entire TIME shoot took nearly an hour and the photographer and his team tried several set ups: in the garden, in a living room space and in various parts of the house. In an image used in the magazine story, we see Swift drooped over a family piano, seemingly deep in thought. In a second shot, we see her in the garden in bright sunlight.\n\nTaylor Swift photographed at her parents home in Forest Hills, Tennessee on September 29, 2014.\nTaylor Swift photographed at her parents home in Forest Hills, Tennessee on September 29, 2014.Martin Schoeller for TIME\n“She knew exactly how to sit for a shoot,” Schoeller adds. “It went incredibly smoothly. It’s pretty exciting to photograph a star like her.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift sells millions of records, is BFFs with Lorde and Lena Dunham, knows the best way to mend a broken heart and looks amazing. So what’s the secret to mega girl power, TSwizz style? Well, why don’t we let her tell you…\nIt is the sort of day when Taylor Swift is everywhere. I turn on the radio and Shake It Off blasts out, its infectious hook encouraging the world to, among other things, get down to ‘This. Sick. Beat.’ On my desk is British Vogue with Taylor on its cover in a perfect pastel Miu Miu outfit, and on my phone the internet is basically breaking itself with hype about 1989, Taylor’s fifth studio album.\nIt’s not necessarily abnormal for the day to start in a Taylor Swift frenzy. Lately, whether she’s releasing an album or not, there will usually be some news story –about what she’s doing/where she’s eating/who she’s eating with/her BFFs or even her cats – that’s sent Instagram insane and has Tumblr tripping over itself. She is, after all, one of the biggest artists in the world right now, Billboard’s Woman of 2014 and the first person to ever receive that award twice.\nWhat is abnormal, however, is that today she’s also standing in front of me. Not a meme, not a gif, not a speculative story on a gossip site, but the real-life Taylor Swift, going through a rail of clothes, flicking through music on her iPhone, then pausing to play a song she loves, and having a cuteness explosion at a video of the photographer’s daughter doing a three-year-old’s interpretation of We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\nTaylor in the flesh is all the things you would expect – tall, whip smart, pretty and with an excellent amount of sass in her humour. A little subdued perhaps, due to the myriad time zones, talk shows and trotting around the globe she’s been doing to promote her latest album, but, in spite of some super fans’ claims to the contrary, I’m relieved to find she is actually only human.\nWe sit down to chat post-shoot. Taylor stretches out her mile-long legs on the sofa, grabbing an opportunity to put her feet up, and I explain the interview as she settles in.\nWe’re going to talk through the things she’s learnt, I say. Love, career, friendship… her life lessons, if you will, the sort of advice that has made her the go-to friend, support system and cheerleader for the likes of Lena Dunham and Lorde, Karlie Kloss and Selena Gomez.\nTaylor smiles and relaxes back into the sofa. She’s got this. Because whether it’s getting her voice heard in meetings, dealing with a broken heart, being a best friend or taking criticism – the sort of things we all go through – she’s been there too, and she probably has a number one song to prove it. So here, just for you, is what life has taught Taylor Swift so far…\nIF YOU AREN’T CHALLENGING YOURSELF, NO ONE ELSE WILL\n‘Work isn’t about just showing up, it’s about so much more than that. It’s up to you to take risks – you have to decide that you want to get better and you want to learn. When you reach a certain level of success, which you inevitably will in your life if you work hard, people become OK with anything you create. Only you will be the one who pushes you and decides what the next level will be.’\nYOU HAVE TO FACE PAIN HEAD-ON\n‘There is a line in Clean, the last song on 1989 – “When I was drowning, that’s when I could finally breathe.” It talks about the loss of a relationship, but it could be about addiction, depression or the loss of someone. There’s this quote in [the book] The Fault In Our Stars, “Pain demands to be felt.” No matter how many times society tells you to put on a smiling face, pain is going to be felt one way or another, today or a year from now. I’ve seen people go through incredible difficulties and the ones who faced pain head-on made it out quicker than the ones who pretended they were OK.’\nBUSINESS DOESN’T EXIST WITHOUT CREATIVITY\n‘The most important thing to preserve when you are your own boss, is your imagination. When you’re dealing with so much business, scheduling and meetings, it’s important to go off on whims and have your imagination stay intact so you can come up with the creative ideas that will fuel the business. I don’t think any business would exist without creativity. It can’t all be about power, fame and running some kind of empire. It has to all come from the fact that you like creating something.’\nNEVER LOSE YOUR COOL AT WORK\n‘The easiest, best, most effective way to make someone listen to you is to speak in an even tone. A lot of people think if they’re shouting the loudest, they’ll be heard, but most people lose respect for you when you lose your cool. You have to maintain everyone’s respect, especially as a woman in a position of power. It’s terrible to be at that kind of disadvantage, where if you yell, people will talk about you behind your back much more than if you were a man. Because of those social injustices we face as women, you have to make sure that no one can call you a crazy bitch.’\nBE CREATIVE WITH FASHION, BUT AVOID FADS\n‘I think that as much as you should be creative and experiment, there are certain things I know are fads and so I try to steer clear of most of the obvious ones. I play the tape of my life forward and don’t wear the things that my kids or grandkids will make fun of me for wearing – [adopts sarcastic voice] “Wow, cool, mom, cool cowboy boots that you were wearing constantly in 2006!”’\nDRESS FOR GIRLS, NOT BOYS\n‘When I’m getting dressed, it’s always based on what my friends will think. They are my number one priority and the opinions of girls are more important to me at this point in my life. But depending on the city I’m in and depending on the time of day and what mood I’m in, my choices are ever changing. That’s what keeps fashion exciting. You’re always coming from a different place of inspiration.’\nAVOID WARDROBE MALFUNCTIONS\n‘For me, it’s important to be comfortable in what I’m wearing. Being comfortable means that no one’s going to be able to pull a fast one and take a picture of me that they’ll deem to be embarrassing. I don’t want to wear something so short that I’m scared there will be a wardrobe malfunction, or have a picture of me falling out of my shorts or skirt.’\nA NEW RELATIONSHIP WON’T CURE HEARTBREAK\n‘Fixing your heartbreak by getting into another relationship is not the way to live your life – you need to live it on your terms for a while. Honestly, being in my twenties and only focusing on what I want, moving to New York because I wanted to, cutting my hair short because I wanted to, making all these decisions based on the direction I wanted to go has been the most liberating thing I’ve done in my life. You can have love all around you without being in love, and find romance in your everyday life without being in a romantic relationship. That can be just as fulfilling.’\nEVERYBODY LOVES INA GARTEN’S MUSTARD FISH RECIPE\n‘Ina is the author of the Barefoot Contessa books and her recipe for mustard-roasted fish with capers is uh-mazing. I also make a really good Indian roasted cauliflower for my vegetarian friends, which they request when they come over. I roast the cauliflower in olive oil and add a yoghurt sauce with spices and pine nuts.’\nGOOD FRIENDS CHOOSE SIDES\n‘Loyalty is so important and it isn’t easy because it ruffles feathers. You will not be universally liked if you are loyal to your friends because it means you will always pick their side. If your friend has a problem with someone, or someone is terrible to them, even if that person is nice to you, you’re gonna give them a look. You’re not going to go and take pictures with someone who’s just been mean to your friend so they can post them on Instagram.’\nKEEP YOUR FRIENDSHIPS REAL\n‘My friends are the kind of people who have their own lives and their own busy schedules, and that’s why we get along so well. A lot of “celebrities” surround themselves with chic cling-ons who don’t have much of a job or a passion. They follow around their celebrity BFF and provide constant affirmation for them. I’m really not interested in that kind of deal.’\nCOSINESS IS KEY AT CHRISTMAS\n‘A Christmas at my house is as cosy as possible. Last Christmas, my parents and my brother and I went to the beach in New England, and it was freezing cold and snowy, and I got the whole family these red plaid Christmas onesies with Santa hats. Romping around in these crazy onesies was the most childlike, throwback, nostalgia-filled Christmas.’\nNOT ALL NEGATIVITY IS BAD\n‘The first step to receiving negativity is to decide whether or not it is the opinion of somebody who you care about. If it’s somebody who I respect, then I really do take it into account because “haters gonna hate” only applies to people who are simply criticising you because their life sucks. Some people take other people down or spread rumours about them because they’re afraid of them in some way. However, I’ve gotten criticism from journalists who I respect that I legitimately applied to my career and my songwriting, and it’s made me better.’\nLET YOUR SKIN BREATHE\n‘I have so much foundation and make-up on all the time for work that it can feel like your face is painted, so when I’m not working, I like to let my skin breathe as much as possible. I wear moisturiser at night and in the morning I put it on before I put on foundation, or I use tinted moisturiser rather than foundation.’\nALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR INSTINCTS\n‘There’s this little feeling that you get called intuition. Most of the time you ignore it, but becoming more attuned to what your gut is telling you helps you to make the best decisions. As a songwriter, it’s really important for me to listen to random emotions that I feel and to figure out what they are and write about them. But even if you’re not a songwriter, it’s important to really think about how your body is responding to a certain situation. Sometimes your body will tell you a situation isn’t right even before your mind knows it.’\nWE’RE SUPPOSED TO GO OUT AND MAKE MISTAKES\n‘As much as I would really like to have saved myself heartache, embarrassment or gossip, I also know that my biggest mistakes have turned into my best lessons and sometimes my greatest career triumphs. The songs I’ve written about my moments of humiliation, embarrassment or devastation have gotten me the greatest sense of clarity. If my life had been turbulence free, no bumps in the road at all, maybe my music would be more beige, maybe the stadiums wouldn’t be so full and the mantle would be a little more empty. I can’t stand having regrets, but you’re supposed to have them. Anybody who tells you they went through life without regret or error, isn’t telling you the truth and they shouldn’t be trusted.’",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] A TAYLOR-ED REINVENTION\nIn an Australian magazine exclusive, CLEO's Jessica Bailey discovers that there is much, much more to megastar Taylor Swift than outing her ex-boyfriends through song.\nM iss Swift isn't the jilted ex-girlfriend you might think she is. No, she isn't bitter, stung or, at worst, obsessive. However, after six years of chart-topping songs about her past loves, it's warranted if you feel like you have, at times, a fraught relationship with the 24-year-old superstar.\nHer new album 1989 is no different, except for shedding her country sound. What is different about Taylor now is her demeanour - she's no longer subtly (or perhaps not so subtly) calling out men, but calling out the women who, by taking each other down because of guys, disrupt the plight of feminism.\n\"I think when it comes to females in the media, you will see something that kind of upsets me, which is that females are pinned up against each other, more so than men,\" says Taylor. \"One thing I do believe as a feminist is that in order for us to have gender equality we have to stop making it a girl fight and stop being so interested in seeing girls trying to tear each other down. It has to be more about cheering each other on, as women.\"\nAlthough, for all of her confident, bold sound bites, there's still a hint of vulnerability when we broach the meaning behind some of the raw truths in her songs.\n\"Just think about if you're writing in your diary every night,\" she starts, not breaking her stare with me. \"You would write something less revealing if I told you that someday that was going to be published as a memoir. Most of the songs I write never get released; they just help me get through whatever I'm going through at that time. So the songs that do end up out there... I can't stop to think about what the world's going to do with them.\"\nChatting to CLEO in an exclusive sit-down interview - and paying homage to her love for all things Australia including the Camilla & Marc dress she's wearing - Taylor opens up about her killer career as a singing superstar, the public criticism she's been hit with and why women need to stand together, proving once and for all she's got more to talk about than Harry Styles and John Mayer.\nFrom country songstress to pure pop superstar, what made you decide to make the switch in sound?\n\"It was really a natural progression I had made. I've been playing around with pop sensibilities in my songwriting for the past couple of years so to get to be honest about everything and make the album exactly the way I wanted to make it, I'm really happy that it was well received.\"\nWe obviously love every track you produce, but is there a song on your new record 1989 that you have on repeat?\n\"It's hard to choose. Depending on what I'm going through, I'll listen to things and have things gravitate towards me, like there's a song on the album called 'Clean' with Imogen Heap and it's the song I'm really obsessed with. Then there's a song called 'All You Had To Do Was Stay' which is one I'm obsessed with too!\"\nYou've said \"Shake It Off\" is about how to have more fun than the haters. How do you stop them getting to you? \"Well, it's a struggle; it's never something I'm ever going\nto completely master. That's why when a song comes out that says how we all feel about gossip and people getting on your case and just how people treat each other, thankfully it resonated with people. We're never really going to be able to completely ignore people who don't like us for no reason. You hate it when you feel like people may have the wrong impression of you and it's so hard to want to control the need to say, 'No, that's not who I am at all!' But at this point, I try to encourage people not to try to defend themselves. If you know who you are, then you do not need to defend yourself.\"\nYou've also pointed out that this song is an ode to the \"take-down culture\" we now live in. So, as women, how important is it that we support each other?\n\"It's the most terrible thing thinking about the idea that most girls' natural instinct is to look at others as their main competition. This has somehow been ingrained in us since we were little girls - 'She's more competition for you than he is over there,' when really, when you go out into the real world and you're trying to accomplish things, men and women are your competitors. But when girls are thinking too much about getting boys to like them or getting a boyfriend, I think that is when this natural competitiveness instinct kicks in and they start to look at other girls as their competition. It's so unhealthy. I think having grown up, lived through it, having experienced it and having felt that way about other girls at certain points of my life, I now look around and I just love girls. I respect girls and admire girls far more than any of the men around me. You have to stick together and, whether you label yourself as a feminist or not, it's important that we address equal rights.\"\nLet's press play on \"Out Of The Woods\" - it's such a good track. What was the driving force when you were writing this song?\n\"Thank you! Out Of The Woods' is about one of those tentative relationships you have where you are sort of always wondering if you're standing on solid ground, always wondering if you're on the same page with the other person. I think any of us who have been in relationships might be familiar with that feeling. There are some that feel very solid and then there are some that always feel like a work in progress, that always feel a little bit fragile. It's not to say that one is more important or better than the other. I think this song is kind of glorifying that this kind of relationship that wasn't all that. It wasn't the one where you can depend on someone. Day to day, we are always hoping for that next point of relief where you feel like, 'OK, things are good! But most of life is a struggle - and most of love is a struggle.\"\nConsidering you hold nothing back, do you feel the need to constantly defend yourself because you're in the public eye?\n\"Oh, definitely. But it's not an issue that I wouldn't face if I had a different job. People will say things about you that are untrue, people are going to undermine you, people are going to make you feel like you don't deserve what you want and that goes for anyone who's trying to do something special, unique or good.\"\nWe can see just how important your friendships with celebs including Lena Dunham, Karlie Kloss and Lorde are to you. How do you go about choosing your closest friends?\n\"I choose my friends based on people I initially click with. I think that's really important. You know, just being around people who when you say something, they say, 'Oh my God, me too! A lot of my friends, people look at us and think, 'Wow, they seem really opposite, but we relate on the things that are important. We can relate on our ideals and our morals and our ideas on music, feminism, writing, film and things like that. But my friendships are the most important thing to me right now because I can trust them. It's interesting to me, I look around and there's nothing written about me in the press right now that is accurate, so I know none of my friends are talking. Like, if it reads something like, 'A source close to Taylor says...', it's completely false. So I'm just like, 'My friends are good, I've got the right friends!\"\"\nLastly, can you tell us what 'high-school Taylor' would say if she had any idea that her life was going to turn out like this? \"I think 'high-school me' would be stoked. But then again, my\nlife has changed so much I don't think that I would believe you if you would have told me, 'You're going to move to New York, you're going to cut your hair, you're going to have completely different friends than you have now, you're going to have to think about everything you say before you say it, everything you do is going to be documented, even things you don't do are going to be made up. But if I was told all of this, I still would've wanted this life; the idea that I get to write songs as a job is so good that it outweighs anything trivial or ridiculous or irritating.",

      "Transcript/Content": "On the Road with Best Friends Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss\nBY JADA YUAN\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY BY MIKAEL JANSSON\n\nFebruary 13, 2015\n\nPhotographed by Mikael Jansson, Vogue, March 2015\nShooting Stars\nThe two recently road-tripped through Big Sur. “Taylor’s a really good driver,” Kloss says. Saint Laurent by Hedi Slimane woven Lurex dress, blue leather belt (on Kloss), sequined V-neck sweater, and studded belt (on Swift). On Kloss: Barton Perreira sunglasses. Cartier ring. On Swift: Ray-Ban sunglasses. Fashion Editor: Tonne Goodman\nTaylor Swift and Karlie Kloss have forged the kinds of careers—and the kind of friendship—that people dream about.\n\nOne of the first things Taylor Swift did after moving from Nashville to her sprawling two-story penthouse in New York’s Tribeca was cover a wall of her den with framed, blown-up Polaroids of the most important people in her life. “This is when me and Karlie first met,” she says, pointing to a picture of her grinning and hugging model Karlie Kloss backstage at the 2013 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, where Kloss walked the runway in pink underwear and giant psychedelic wings and Swift performed with Fall Out Boy. The caption, handwritten in Sharpie, reads BEST FRIENDS FOREVER VS2013 and feels rather prescient given how close the two have become over the past year or so, with a road trip to Big Sur (dreamily documented on Instagram), restaurant outings, shopping excursions, sleepovers, texting marathons, ModelFit and SoulCycle sessions, and a second joint VS outing late last year in London, where, as the pair walked side by side down the runway in black lace, they exchanged “Can you believe this?!” grins—two friends on top of the world.\n\nLena Dunham and Cara Delevingne also make the Polaroid wall, as does Swift’s younger brother, Austin, 22, a senior at Notre Dame, standing next to his sister in the matching red plaid adult onesies she bought for her family last Christmas. A Polaroid captioned squirrel invasion documents the first time Swift met Lorde (whom Swift calls by her given name, Ella), as the two set out for dinner at Shake Shack in Madison Square Park only to be attacked by rodents. “We were taking these photos, and all of a sudden, like in a horror movie, there were squirrels sitting on our shoulders trying to eat our food,” says Swift, reenacting the moment. “Perched, like parrots! They’re like, ‘We deserve French fries, and we’re going to take them from you.’ ”\n\nSwift click-clacks through her kitchen to her living room in black stiletto Louboutins, plops down on a burnt-orange velvet sofa, wiggles into a slouch, and props those heels up on a tufted brown-leather ottoman. Everything in the apartment is rendered in velvet, leather, and wood in dark, rich earth and jewel tones, from her rosewood Steinway grand piano to her pool table (where VS models Behati Prinsloo and Lily Aldridge apparently proved themselves to be quite the sharks when they came over earlier in the week).\n\nIt’s two days before her twenty-fifth birthday, and Swift is brimming with the confidence of a young woman who’s come into her own. It’s been quite a year: She not only moved to New York, away from her family; she’s also taken risks with her sound, stepping back from the world of country to embrace the throwback purity of eighties pop—with amazing success. “Blank Space,” a defiant (and impossible-not-to-sing-along-to) response to the media’s depiction of her as a crazed man-eater, enjoyed a seven-week run atop the Billboard Hot 100. Swift also became the first female in the chart’s 56-year history to replace herself at No. 1 (her earlier single was the now-ubiquitous “Shake It Off”). Both are from her remarkable new album, 1989, named after the year she was born, which has sold more than six million copies and become, along the way, the fastest-moving rec­ord of the past decade. Saturday Night Live, meanwhile, aired a parody commercial for Swiftamine, a drug to treat the epidemic of vertigo in adults who suddenly realize how much they love Taylor Swift. “People are finally starting to discuss her artistry—how she’s on the level of some of the great all-time songwriters,” says Jack Antonoff of the band fun., who’s co-written several songs with Swift and likens her deeply personal storytelling to new chapters of a book the whole world wants to read. “The other day my grandmother was asking me about 1989. We’re all talking about it. In my lifetime, I haven’t experienced that since Michael Jackson—that one artist who stands above and unites us all.”\n\nSwift has also remixed her personal life. For starters, the once-hopeless romantic who laid her emotions bare in songs about whirlwind love affairs and their aftermaths, like “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” (reportedly about Jake Gyllenhaal) or “I Knew You Were Trouble” and _1989’_s “Out of the Woods” (reportedly about Harry Styles), is pushing back at critics who have dismissed her as boy-obsessed. The tongue-in-cheek “Blank Space” video shows her stabbing a heart-shaped cake with a butcher’s knife, setting a boyfriend’s clothes on fire, and taking a golf club to his gorgeous silver sports car. Kloss, Dunham, and Delevingne, meanwhile, are part of a close-knit group of powerful women friends that Swift has been building over the past few years. Members also include Selena Gomez, whom Swift has known since they were both teenagers dating Jonas brothers; Jaime King, a kind of Earth Mother figure; and the Haim sisters, whom she met last fall. Devoting this much time to her female friendships started out as a reaction, Swift says, “to the way people were overreacting to my life. I was really irritated by the whole serial-dater play that people tried to make about me.”\n\nShe responded by pulling the plug on her love life. “I just decided I wasn’t willing to provide them that kind of entertainment anymore,” she says. “I wasn’t going to go out on dates and have them be allowed to take pictures and say whatever they wanted about our body language. I wasn’t going to sit next to somebody and flirt with them for five minutes, because I know the next day he’ll be rumored to be my boyfriend. I just kind of took the narrative back. It’s unfortunate I had to do that. And it’s unfortunate that now I have this feeling like if I were to open myself up to love, that would be a career weakness.” Instead, Swift is emerging as a powerful figure for teenage girls and young women—someone who takes to task critics and bullies and, yes, men who’ve wronged her, and provides a shining example of a woman shaping her own destiny.\n\n“This last year has felt very different than any other year of my life,” Swift tells me. “I’ve felt more settled and unapologetic about who I am and what I stand for. I think that might be one of those symptoms of growing up and becoming your own person, and depending less on other people’s opinions of you. I just hope that keeps going—because I’m liking it.”\n\nSwift is describing her philosophy about making friends—basically, wear ’em down till they like you—when Kloss sweeps into the apartment, a six-foot-one beam of sunshine. Though Swift and Kloss have known each other for only a year, their best-friendship, they tell me, was instantaneous. They’re a striking pair, particularly now that Kloss’s formerly tawny hair is blonde. “When I did SNL they both came, and at the after-party it was so confusing to everyone, like these Amazon twins,” says Dunham. “Taylor’s so tall, Karlie’s even taller, and together it’s just surreal.”\n\nIf Swift wears heels and Kloss wears flats, they’re the same height. But today, Kloss has messed up the equation by wearing skintight Tamara Mellon leather leggings with boots attached. “All-in-one, baby,” she says, showing them off as she walks the floor bearing a tin of her gluten- and dairy-free Karlie’s Kookies, from her collaboration with Milk Bar.\n\n“They’re kind of the greatest thing I’ve ever seen,” Swift gushes. “You look like Catwoman!” Kloss says they’re custom-made, but she can hook Swift up with a pair. “They’re pretty good,” says Kloss, “but I can’t take them back to St. Louis. When I go home, if I have even an ounce of New York attitude, my family’s like, ‘Nope, nope.’ They don’t let it happen.” “They’re like, ‘You with your shoe pants, you leave those outside!’” says Swift, laughing. “You put on some real pants!”\n\nThough Kloss seems to have a keen awareness of every stitch of fashion she has on her body, when I ask Swift who made her black knit tank dress, she has no idea.\n\nKloss notices the dress, too. “What is this? Alaïa?”\n\nSwift turns to me for help. “I don’t know—do I have a tag in there?” she asks, lifting up her fluffy fair hair and leaning her back toward me. rvn, the tag reads. “My stylist put it in my closet,” she says, burying her face in her hands.\n\nSomehow, though, despite their differing levels of fashion expertise, they often tend to dress the same. “The other night I came over,” says Kloss, “and we were both going someplace from here, and we were both wearing black crop tops and high-waisted skirts. It’s kind of getting weird.”\n\n“Black tights, hair done the same way,” says Swift. “Just like, ‘Ugh, be more annoying.’ We couldn’t possibly be.\n\n“People had been telling us for years we needed to meet,” she adds. “I remember makeup artists and hair people going, ‘Doesn’t she remind you of Karlie? God, she and Karlie would be best friends. They’re the same. Karlie’s such a good girl. She brings us cookies every time we do a shoot.’ ”\n\n“Still do,” says Kloss. As a teen she made them from scratch. Now she makes them professionally—Karlie’s Kookies raises money for charities like FEED, Hurricane Sandy relief, and the CFDA. In addition to the baking venture, Kloss has studied at Harvard Business School (her boyfriend of two years, Joshua Kushner, an early investor in Instagram who recently cofounded the health-care start-up Oscar, is an alumnus) and is now learning computer coding.\n\nA mutual friend, Kloss’s fellow VS model Lily Aldridge, introduced her to Swift, “and we were just like, ‘You. My friend. Now,’ ” says Swift. A few months later they saw each other again at an Oscars after-party, and Kloss suggested they do something spontaneous. “I’d been to Big Sur once before, and I was like, ‘We should just do it,’ ” says Swift.\n\nThey walked beneath the redwoods, ran on the beach at sunset, took a picture hanging off the state-park sign with Kloss wearing Swift’s sweater, the front of which spelled out genius. “It’s ironic, clearly,” Swift is quick to add.\nWhen I ask what they bonded over, they shrug. “We’re both normal people,” says Kloss.\n\n“We’re real girls,” says Swift, who, as if on cue, drops part of the cookie she’s eating on her dress, picks it up, and eats it. “Five-second rule.”\n\nSwift is, by all accounts, an amazing person to be friends with. She cooks, she bakes, she does the dishes; she’s a fantastic host, she gives great gifts. She has a collection of old-timey nightgowns that she and her friends wear while watching television and—technology aside—pretending they’re living in frontier days. (Swift, who shows me a picture on her phone of her, Cara Delevingne, and Kendall Jenner all lying in her bed looking like Little House on the Prairie, inspired Dunham to start her own collection.) Every hang, it seems, ends in a dance party in her kitchen. Dunham calls her “the Betty Crocker of friendships” and says she’s most impressed by how Swift always has time for the people she loves. “It’s amazing to have a friend who’s that busy and also so available,” says Dunham. “Even if she’s in Hong Kong on tour and I’m going through something, if I text her, I get an answer in two seconds. If something good happens to me—say, I get a nomination, or it’s my birthday, or the day before my birthday, or my book comes out—I get a text from Taylor way before I get a text from my mom.”\n\nSome of Swift’s eagerness to make friends probably comes from her having felt like an outcast while growing up. “I have lots of issues from school,” she says. “You can tell, probably.” Essentially, she left the small Pennsylvania town where she was made fun of for her music and formed a close community where she’s now surrounded by people with similar talents and creative ambitions. It’s a kind of high school do-over in which she can join whatever clique she wants—or decide to abolish cliques altogether. When I ask Swift which metaphorical lunch table she sits at now, she immediately gets what I’m saying. “I want to make the table as big as possible, and I want everyone to sit with me,” she says.\n\nThe next day at _Billboard’_s Women in Music Awards luncheon (where Aretha Franklin sings her an impromptu “Happy Birthday” that Swift later tweets will take her decades to recover from), she sings along to every song, from performances to montages—she knows the words to everything. If female musicians are supposed to all be out for one another’s blood, it’s not happening on Swift’s watch.\n\nEvery kid in the room who comes up to her, meanwhile, gets not only a selfie but a conversation. “Little children! I must attend to them,” she says, apologizing for running off in the middle of a conversation. An eleven-year-old girl sheepishly tells Swift she’s from New Jersey. “I spent the summers going down to the Jersey Shore,” says Swift and poses for four apparently blurry selfies before gently taking the phone from the girl’s hand. “You’re really bad at this,” Swift jokes, taking the photo herself. The girl is going to be at Z100’s Jingle Ball concert, where Swift is the closing performer, that night. “I go on really late,” Swift warns her. “Do you drink coffee?” The girl says she drinks Frappuccinos. “OK,” says Swift, “drink a Frappuccino and you might be able to stay awake long enough to see me.”\n\n“New York City, it’s good to be home! I’m Taylor,” says Swift. It’s shortly before midnight, and she’s standing onstage at Madison Square Garden addressing a screaming crowd of 17,000 as if she’s talking to one of her girlfriends on the phone. Dressed in red plaid high-waisted pants and a matching crop top, her hair feathered like Blondie-era Debbie Harry, she blazes through four hits before announcing that she has officially turned 25. “I know why you choose music—it’s because you want to escape from haters and frenemies,” Swift tells the crowd, instructing us to exchange nods of solidarity with our neighbors. “This is the last song of the night,” she continues. “No one’s gonna judge you for how you dance during this song. New York City, are you ready?” The place goes nuts.\n\nSwift returns to her apartment well past midnight, orders sushi, and sets up a makeshift photo booth to host what seems like every famous person in music. She has invited all her fellow performers (Iggy Azalea, Charli XCX, Ariana Grande, Sam Smith, Nick Jonas), along with other friends ranging from Kloss to Abigail Anderson—Swift’s best friend since freshman year of high school in suburban Hendersonville, Tennessee—to Justin Timberlake and Jay Z and Beyoncé. “I have, like, 20 different people flying in,” Swift had told me the day before. “My friends are staying in every room.” Her mother, Andrea, however—who flew in from Nashville earlier laden with decorations now draped over mirrors and mantels, with every window in the place (I lose count at fifteen) garlanded as well—isn’t there. “I think a twenty-fifth birthday, no mother should be there,” Andrea told me. “You need to know when to step away.”\n\nThe next time I catch up with Swift, she’s still in her PJs at 11:15 on a perfect sunny January morning at her house in Beverly Hills. In the month since I saw her turn 25 she’s become the proud owner of a bejeweled necklace (a birthday gift from Dunham) bearing the image of her kitten Olivia; danced like crazy with Beyoncé and the Haim sisters at a Justin Timberlake concert in Brooklyn; bought the shirt off Hugh Jackman’s back (giving $6,000 to the Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS charity in the process) while seeing him perform on Broadway with her family; sent out a large batch of gift packages to her fans, one of which included a Swift painting of flowers and a check for $1,989 to help pay off a student loan; and rung in the New Year onstage in Times Square in front of a million people live and a billion more on TV and the Web. Since she’s been out West, though, she’s been doing what she can to catch up with friends, including “a lot of cooking nights,” hiking with Lorde, and wandering around Catalina Island eating ice cream with her girlfriends and her dad. When Lorde sounded stressed about going to the Golden Globes, Swift showed up in support wearing a bright-yellow dress (in honor of Lorde’s nominated song, “Yellow Flicker Beat”). “We just turned it into a girls’ night,” Swift says over the phone.\n\nFor both today and the foreseeable future, though, Swift is going to be all business getting ready for the 1989 world tour, which kicks off May 5 in Tokyo. There’s a set list to finalize, and wardrobe and production design to approve, and choreography to learn. She insists she’s not nearly as awkward a dancer as she pretends to be in the “Shake It Off” video: “If I get serious about choreography, I will learn it and I’ll do it correctly—most of the time,” she says.\n\nLooking back on what’s been both a tumultuous and momentous time in her life, Swift says she and her family “had a lot of moments where we would look at each other and say, ‘Wow—I can’t believe people got it.’ You only hope for things like this.” She’s been trying to take it all as it comes. “I don’t get so caught up in the work that I don’t appreciate the crazy, incredible, astonishing, joyous success that’s happened,” she says. “Putting pressure on yourself is good, but putting unnecessary stress on yourself is bad—so I don’t worry that I haven’t started the next record yet. I don’t worry that I don’t know what it’s going to be. I’m not worried that I have absolutely no timetable as to when it needs to be done. It could be two years from now; it could be three, it could be four. Or it could be one. You get these bursts of inspiration right at the moment you’re not expecting to. You just have to live your life, and hopefully you’ll take the right risks.”\n\nKloss, for her part, has been maintaining the kind of schedule that would seem to require its own air-traffic controller. After a short break back home in St. Louis, she’s been back and forth to Paris twice in early January alone as part of her new job as a L’Oréal Paris spokesperson; to the Florida Keys for a Bruce Weber shoot; and to L.A. and Paris again for L’Oréal. Next up: back to L.A. for the Oscars before ramping up for Fashion Weeks in New York, Milan, and Paris. “In moderation it can be really fun,” says Kloss, who’s cut the 60 shows she used to walk at the start of her career down to a fraction of that. “For me, runway is an opportunity to perform.”\n\nShe’s also practically bursting to tell me some big news: She’s been accepted to NYU’s Gallatin School of Individualized Study. (NYU alum Christy Turlington Burns wrote her letter of recommendation.) “I was waiting for the mail to arrive every single day,” she says. “It’s something that I’ve wanted to do for a very long time.” Kloss doesn’t yet know what she’ll study; for now, she’s just excited to be taking classes. “I’ll still be working full-time,” she says. “I’m incredibly ambitious and have lots of goals within my career that I’m not slowing down on anytime soon.”\n\nSwift says she and her friends don’t talk much about work. “The fun thing about my friends is that they don’t necessarily know a lot about what I do business-wise,” she says. The first time Kloss ever saw Swift pick up a guitar and noodle around on it was during the photo shoot for this story. “I’m not one of those singers who’s always like, ‘Look at me!’ ” says Swift. “I’m not the person who grabs the guitar at a party and wants all the attention. I have attention on me enough, so I want my friends to just like me because we have things in common rather than me sitting in a corner being like, ‘Listen to this song that I wrote about my life!’ ”\n\nNo matter how busy they are, though, Swift and Kloss continue to make time for each other. Swift recently had Kloss over to her place for a night of cooking pasta with model Martha Hunt, stylist Ashley Avignone, and Tavi Gevinson. A few days later that same group went to dinner at Ralph Lauren’s restaurant, the Polo Bar, in midtown. (“The French fries were delicious,” says Kloss.)\n\nKloss says that bringing together disparate women from different industries may be Swift’s most unsung talent. “I’ve met a lot of really great girls through Taylor. She’s incredible at connecting people who might not normally meet. We’re all in different jobs, but we’ve become strong friends who are there for each other—a sisterhood of girls, a support team. But we’re also just normal 20-something girls, and I think you have to have people that you can be that with. You know, real friends are hard to find—and Taylor’s a real friend. There’s nothing better.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "[WIP] Us Weekly got an exclusive first look at Swift's interview for the project with Walters, in which the country-turned-pop star discusses her dating life, how she stays sane, and even her drinking habits. \n\"You have such a good reputation,\" the celebrated journalist, 85, began in her chat with Swift, 24. \"You have never been 'the bad girl'… You don't drink. You don't smoke.\"\n\"I mean, I do drink, I am 25,\" interjected Swift, who will celebrate her 25th birthday on Saturday, Dec. 13. \"So it's not like, I mean… Yeah, I was at a Knicks game and I had a beer and everybody was like, 'Ohhh!' I was like, 'Tsk.'\"\nThough Swift says she doesn't entirely live up to her largely squeaky-clean image, the \"Blank Space\" singer added that she wasn't sipping on any cold ones before she was legally of age. \n\"I did wait until I was 21 to drink,\" the Grammy winner explained. \"I was so paranoid about getting in trouble or setting the wrong example or sending the wrong message.\"\nShe went on to acknowledge some of her younger fans, and how they influence her decisions. \n\"I put every one of my actions through a filter before I do them because that's the way my life is,\" Swift continued. \"That the reality… If I do something reckless or thoughtless or careless, or I treat someone badly, that doesn't just affect me; it affects that person. Then, if that story gets out, or some 10-year-old sees that I did that in a news article… my actions do have ripples.\"\nWhile Walters called Swift's reputation and example-setting \"a big responsibility,\" the \"Shake It Off\" singer said the monitoring presents a positive outcome.\n\"It's kind of a nice thing to keep you in check to live a good life,\" she said. \"It's not like some gilded golden cage that people make it out to be. Living your life the 'right way' and trying to make 'good decisions' is not necessarily some horrible penalty.\"\nShe has been adamant about not having a boyfriend as of late.\nI don't see a scenario right now, the way my life is, in which it could work,\" she told Walters of being in a relationship. \"So I don't think about it because I don't like to think about things that I can't solve.\"\nAfter Swift offered up such a calm take on her romantic life, Walters said to the singer, \"You seem very sane… It's not that fashionable all the time… You seem very centered.\"\n\"I think all the time about big concepts in my life,\" Swift explained. \"I don't have answers for everything and that doesn't scare me. I think the reason I am sane is because I have a really good family who are all very sane, in the midst of all this kind of insanity surrounding my life. That really helps — it really helps — cause I can talk to them about it and they are gonna be very honest with me about it. But always, always really supportive.\"\nSee more from Swift's chat with Walters in Barbara Walters Presents: The 10 Most Fascinating People of 2014, airing on ABC on Sunday, Dec. 14, at 9:00 p.m./8:00 p.m. CT.

She dated him, that's why.\n\n'They dated in freshman year. Picture To Burn is about him.

You know. I was shocked, kind of like, ''Whoa, OK… well that's cool, what other ones are about us?'',' she added.\n\n'But then it was kind of funny, it was so long ago now, who even cares,' Chelsea said.\n\nThe couple were told by Taylor's best friend Abigail Anderson that the song was about Jordan.\n\n'We just thought it was funny. [Jordan] was like, ''I'm not a redneck! She makes me look like some redneck!'' but other than that we just thought it was kind of funny,' Chelsea said.\n\nFriends again: Chelsea said that Taylor met her for coffee and was kind to her little sister\n+\n4\nView gallery\nFriends again: Chelsea said that Taylor met her for coffee and was kind to her little sister\n\n\nTaylor's lyrics to Picture To Burn include: 'State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy / I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me / So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy / That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay.'\n\nKindergarten teacher Chelsea, 24, said she and Taylor even got into an argument over Jordan – who was still known by his birth name, Paul, at the time – by their lockers.\n\nShe added: 'We exchanged a few words over a locker fight. We were 14, we were just being girly, snarky.' \n\nChelsea also told how everyone at their school was mesmerized by Taylor's self-titled first album, and tried to figure out who each of the songs was about.\n\nShe said: 'We know other people she wrote songs about. That first record was a game, like, 'OK, which one is this about? OK, did they even date? No? that's weird.'\n\n'There were other songs on there about people that we talked about more probably, like Tears On My Guitar, about the guy she never dated, we were like ''that's a little odd.''\n\n'She really does write her own songs, so I guess if you date her you have to know you're going to get a song written about you. In our case, back in school nobody thought she was actually going to go anywhere,' Chelsea said. \n\n\nPop superstar: Taylor is shown on Monday leaving her apartment in the Tribeca area of New York City\n+\n4\nView gallery\nPop superstar: Taylor is shown on Monday leaving her apartment in the Tribeca area of New York City\n\nChelsea had science classes with Taylor, who she described as 'sweet' and 'kind of goofy' and said she could tell when the budding singer was writing a song instead of paying attention.\n\nShe explained: 'She would be in class and she'd be writing, rather than paying attention at all. She was different, she wasn't super popular, she kind of did her own thing. A normal, high school girl kind of thing.'\n\nWhen it comes to guys, Chelsea doesn't think her former friend is ready to settle down yet, but when she is, it likely will be with a British gentleman.\n\nShe added: 'She liked to talk in a British accent. She would do that, [and] her ideal man would be a younger Hugh Grant, he's in her favourite movie, Love Actually.\n\n'I don't think she'll settle down and have a family for a while, she's too boy crazy not too, but I think she will live it up for a while first. It sounds like she goes between crazy cat lady and dating people, it goes back and forth, why not have fun.\n\n'I thought her and Jake Gyllenhaal were really cute together but that didn't last long,' Chelsea said.\n\nTaylor grew up close to US country music capital Nashville, and when she made her debut she was billed as a country artist. \n\nFormer classmates: Chelsea said Taylor would sometimes write songs in class instead of paying attention\n+\n4\nView gallery\nFormer classmates: Chelsea said Taylor would sometimes write songs in class instead of paying attention\n\n\nShe has since swapped for pop and Chelsea thought that has always suited her style of songwriting better. \n\nShe added: 'She was never very country, her direction now is more of how you think she would go, because she's not from here, she's from Pennsylvania, which is not country. They found a way to get her in [the country scene] no one else was wearing sundresses flowers and boots and that became her little niche. She slipped right in at a good time.'\n\nDespite falling out over Jordan, Chelsea and Taylor later buried the hatchet and she said they often say hello if they see each other around town.\n\nTaylor even met up with Chelsea and her younger sister one day for a coffee.\n\n'She was really sweet, when I was in college, I texted her and said, ''Hey girl is there any way you can meet my little sister? You're famous now and she doesn't remember you from before.''\n\n'She was really cool, she met us at a Starbucks and let my sister sing to her and gave her autographs, she was really, really sweet. She did that and we hadn't talked in years,' Chelsea said.\n\n'I haven't bought her latest record, but we haven't got around to it yet. I like Shake it Off, I think it's a good song,' she added.\n\n ",

Do you have any memories of watching the ball drop on TV when you were younger?\nA. When I was a kid, we would watch “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve” show every year and count down to midnight while standing around the TV. It’s so cool to get to be a part of a tradition that shaped my childhood holiday memories.\nI’ve played Times Square on New Year’s a few times before, but there’s such a new feeling to my music now. There’s a lot to celebrate about this past year, and there are so many things I’m looking forward to next.\nQ. If you weren’t performing on NYE, what would you be doing?\nA. I have absolutely no idea what I’d be doing on New Year’s if I wasn’t playing in Times Square. I’m sure I’d text my friends and see what they’re all planning to do. Thankfully, I have really solid plans for the evening!\nQ. What are your plans for playing MetLife Stadium on the “1989” world tour?\nA. Playing MetLife Stadium on the Red tour was so incredible, and I’ll never forget that crowd. Fall Out Boy was nice enough to come out and surprise the crowd by playing one of their songs, “My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark.”\nI love throwing in surprises and curveballs, so each crowd has a customized experience. New York crowds are so giving and so enthusiastic and wild, I always plan things for them.  \nI was really proud of the “Red” tour, but I’m so much more proud [of] “1989” as an album. I feel like I have so much to work with on the set list and so many visuals to create.\nThis new album is a completely new sound, and my goal is for the tour to be a completely new experience for fans.",

      "Transcript/Content": "READING, Pa. — The search to fill in a weirdly untold story about Taylor Swift has become a medium-speed car chase. I’m in my vehicle, following this guy Joe in a red Mazda through the hills surrounding Reading, Pa., looking for Ronnie Cremer at DC Computer Repairs.\n\nSwift’s “Shake It Off” is blaring, and the song’s energy adds tension to the drive. It is fair to say we’re zipping, scooting through a few yellow lights. This is Joe’s style, apparently. He makes a sharp left into a McDonald’s; I pull beside him in the parking lot and roll down the window.\n\n“I’ll be right back, I’m just going to pick up my friend,” Joe says in a Queens-bred, wiseguy patter.\n\nThe Swift tale has been told endlessly, but never fully. Anyone with basic knowledge of pop culture can recite the cast of friends, exes and characters in her official bio: John Mayer, Lena Dunham, Joe Jonas, Karlie Kloss, Harry Styles.\n\nBut there is also the guy we’re racing to find. Ronnie Cremer. The man behind the myth. Or the man the myth forgot. Haven’t heard of him? Neither had I, until a few hours ago, at least not by name. But now there is an identity. And an address. And a sense that the story behind an icon is minutes away.\n\nJoe — more on him later — is leading me. He emerges from the McDonald’s with a guy who he was supposed to meet for coffee, before he got wrapped up in this pursuit. He gets back in his car, and takes me to the computer store.\n\nRonnie is not in his office. He is out on a service call. So Joe and his friend take me back to McDonald’s, and we have coffee for about an hour.\n\nI eventually return to the place alone and ask the nice woman at the desk if Ronnie is back yet. A man — shaved head, black shirt, average height, roundish — is standing behind her; he smiles and says, “I’ve been dreading this moment.”\n\n***\n\nThe previous evening: Gray, 46 degrees, and foggy at the former Swift home on Grandview Blvd. in Wyomissing, Pa. The street is dead. If you’re from a suburb situated this many hours from a major city, you have sat staring out a window like this one, thinking something like, “There’s a little girl in this little town/With a little too much heart to go around.”\n\nThat’s from the first song that Swift wrote, “Lucky You.” People aching to taste more of the world will turn inward in a place like this, and plot an exit.\n\nThere's another side to the story about how Swift learned to play guitar, says the man who taught her.\nThere’s another side to the story about how Swift learned to play guitar, says the man who taught her.\nSwift has many times told a story that goes like this (from a 2009 promotional DVD):\n\n“When I was about 12 this magical twist of fate (happened). I was doing my homework [when the tech fixing my computer] looked over and saw the guitar in the corner. And he said, ‘Do you play guitar?’ I said, ‘Oh. No. I tried, but...’ He said ‘Do you want me to teach you a few chords?’ and I said, ‘Uh, yeah. YES!'”\n\nWhich brings us to Ronnie Cremer and the moment he’s been dreading.\n\n“I don’t want to burn any bridges,” he says, as we settle into two stools at the front of his street-level computer store. “But at the same time, at some point it’s gonna be time.”\n\nA reporter is here. So it’s time. Around us: computer monitors, cords, an acoustic guitar. Above us on the wall: A Taylor Swift platinum album — a gift from Scott Swift, the singer’s dad.\n\nRonnie fixes computers, yes, but is also a respected local musician. That official story about the computer tech? Ronnie has seen Taylor recount it on many TV shows, and has wished to hear what he says is the full version:\n\n“The first time I heard of Taylor, my brother had a theater company. They would have parties after the show, and they would do karaoke. My mom would attend these.”\n\nRonnie continues: “I only met Taylor face-to-face in 2002. I had a shop up in Leesport. It was a computer shop, and that’s where I had my little studio. My brother brought Taylor and her mom and her brother over and introduced me, and said, ‘would you be interested in recording a demo?’\n\n“It was a couple cover songs. I recorded the demo for her. It wasn’t a great demo, but it was a demo.\n\n“After I did the demo, I was approached again by my brother, and by Andrea Swift. ‘Would I be interested in giving guitar lessons for Taylor? We’re trying to teach her how to play country music.’ I said, ‘I don’t know if I can teach country music. I don’t know the first thing about country music. I know rock music.’\n\n“But eventually we did get together. They came out to my place once, but from there on in we met at her house in Wyomissing.”\n\nAnd from there, Ronnie says, they continued working, two evenings a week, $32 per hour.\n\nSo, he never went over to fix her computer?\n\n“Honestly, it was probably months before I even looked at a computer for them,” Ronnie says.\n\n“I did do computer work for them, but the computer work eventually came after I started doing guitar work. It went from teaching her guitar, to teaching her how to structure songs.”\n\n'In all honesty, I thought she was a pretty good student,' Cremer says of teaching Swift guitar.\n\nThis is a perfectly fine story, but how does Ronnie feel about Swift’s shortened version?\n\n“I never wanted to be the person who always begrudged someone’s success,” he says. “And for whatever reason, and I don’t know if I’m even mad at the Swifts. It’s just that their publicity team, that doesn’t sell as good: A 36-year-old bald guy taught her. That ain’t gonna work. If you say, he worked with her six hours a week, it was basically Tuesdays and Thursday from 5 to 8. That ain’t gonna sell.”\n\n***\n\n“Growth is betrayal. There is no other route. There is no arriving somewhere without leaving somewhere.”\n\nThat’s John Updike in “Rabbit Redux.” He was from Shillington, Pa., and in a confluence of American legends who couldn’t quite shake this place, Swift grew up in the heart of Rabbit Angstrom country, too: Reading, Pa., and its surrounding hills, where Ronnie sits in his shop, wrestling with complex memories.\n\n“We started with G, D, E, A,” he says. “Where she had problems were the more difficult chords, the F’s and the B’s. F is really hard on the fingers, so I would teach her things like, ‘OK, if you want to play a song in F, play it in D and put the capo on the third capo.’ So you notice when she plays, she still moves that capo around a lot.”\n\nAt first, progress was slow. “The first couple months, I thought it was a joke,” Ronnie says. “I thought, here’s a bunch of rich people …’\n\nBut Taylor kept at it, and they began working with Ableton Live, a computer program useful for songwriting and recording.\n\n“I said, ‘Here’s your chorus. Here’s your verse. Move these around, and look what you’ve got. You can write one verse, one chorus, and then you’ve got a song.’ That just clicked to her, and made sense.”\n\nDuring this time, Ronnie was also trying to help build a website for Taylor, but says that Andrea Swift made that job difficult.\n\n“That was eventually what led me to part ways with Andrea, because she was just like a bull in a china shop,” he says. “If you didn’t drop what you were doing to work on whatever Taylor wanted, she would lose her mind.”\n\nThere were other glimpses of the household that struck Ronnie as darker.\n\n“They didn’t have a good relationship, the mother and father,” Ronnie says. “(Scott) used to tell me… ‘I got a wife that doesn’t love me. I’m trying to help my daughter out, and do all the right things, and my wife could care less.’ So it was a weird dynamic.”\n\nAnd this:\n\n“Her brother Austin, who was a little chubby at the time — he’s not that now — he wanted Taco Bell,” Ronnie recalls. “Taylor said, ‘I want Taco Bell, too.’ And her mother went out and got Taco Bell, but only gave it to Austin because she said, ‘nobody wants to see a fat pop star.’ She said that to Taylor. So Taylor had to eat a salad.”\n\nThe Swifts, through their publicist, declined multiple requests for comment.\n\n***\n\nBefore finding Ronnie, there were false leads, which is how I met Joe. On the eve of my trip, a friend of the Swifts provided a tip: It wasn’t a computer tech at all who taught her guitar, but a pizza guy. And the pizza guy had never gotten any credit.\n\nBut it turns out this wasn’t quite right. Joe Piecora — the guy who drives that speedy red Mazda — is 63, a New Yorker who loves to talk and a onetime pizza man who also gave Swift guitar lessons for a year. But only after Ronnie had worked with her on chords. Joe’s task was to teach fingerstyle guitar. And in his telling, the student struggled.\n\nActually, it is not difficult to get Joe going on what he sees as the many myths of Taylor Swift. He doesn’t like her music, he doesn’t like the marketing, he doesn’t like the image-making.\n\n“You ever hear the famous phrase Coal Miner’s Daughter?” Joe says. “I mean, basically, they’re trying to put a West Virginia spin on the Taylor Swift legend. Nobody buys a Christmas tree there.”\n\nHe is alluding to the official story that Taylor grew up on a Christmas tree farm. Defining her childhood home turns out to be a whole other caper. There are two places. One is a farm in Shillington. The exact tale, per locals, is that the Swifts grew and sold Douglas firs on a property they owned about a mile away. They also grew, but did not sell, trees behind their home. Close enough.\n\nThere’s the other place on Grandview Blvd. in tonier Wyomissing, set deep in a suburban housing tract 7 miles from the farm. It is a 5,000 square foot classical revival that sold in 2013 for $700,000, according to records. Scott Swift, a wealth management adviser and senior VP at Merrill Lynch, rented it for a time, and the family lived there.\n\nConfused? You’re not alone. Even neighbors have all kinds of trouble pinning down when the Swifts lived where, and for how long. Everyone knows that they hustled off to Nashville in 2004, and rarely looked back.\n\nIt was on Grandview Blvd., not the whatever farm, where Ronnie and Joe gave the guitar lessons.\n\n“Taylor was the product of — it’s like the stage parent, beauty pageant documentaries that you see,” is Joe’s view.\n\n***\n\nBut this is not a tale of mean spirit. Like her music or not, there is something about Taylor Swift that connects. Deeply.\n\n“It is really intense,” says Rolling Stone’s Rob Sheffield, who gave Swift’s “1989” a four-star review and named it the No. 2 album of 2014. “She is an absolutely fantastic live performer. The songs are from the heart and that comes across in performance, and that’s something that her fans connect to.”\n\nSheffield goes on to offer two hefty compliments. “She is very Springsteen-like as a songwriter and a performer,” he says. “And also, she’s a bit like Carole King in terms of her craftiness as a songwriter … There isn’t anybody, at any age, consistently making records like this.”\n\nRewind to the 2006 FallFest in nearby Lancaster. A 9-year-old local singer named Stephanie Grace won a “Kids Country Idol” contest run by a local radio station; the prize was to perform one song before the opening act at this annual festival.\n\nThe opening act was Taylor Swift, 16, returning home to promote her eponymous first album. The confessional style, the ability to connect with the crowd, as if she were reading from her diary, was already there. Swift was up on stage, just dishing.\n\n“I wrote this about a boy named Drew,” she’d say, and Stephanie thought, she’s just so open, I want to write like that.\n\nBackstage, Taylor threw an arm around Stephanie, a pipsqueak in a white cowboy hat, and invited her behind the Swift table in the autograph tent.\n\nThen Taylor looked right at the little girl and presented a gift that would last for the rest of her striving childhood: She took her seriously.\n\n“Do you write?” Taylor asked.\n\nAbout six months later, Taylor was back in Reading to play at the local performing arts center. By then, she was blowing up, and the autograph line after the show was 300 deep. When Stephanie and her mom were sixth from the front, her mom did an embarrassing thing and said, “Do you remember Stephanie?”\n\nStephanie was like, ‘Mom!’ but Taylor smiled big, and connected again. “Of course, I remember! She was such a great singer.”\n\nStephanie is 18 now, working at getting out, shuffling between Nashville and Pennsylvania with the pic of herself and Taylor always in her iPhone.\n\n'When it came to shooting, we just totally connected, and it continued through the years,' Orth says of photographing Swift.\nThat is real.\n\n***\n\nAndrew Orth is standing in a barn next to the Swift farm in Shillington. He is talking because he misses Taylor, and wants to reconnect. He is hoping that she reads this, and sees that he holds no grudge.\n\nThe barn is Orth’s photography studio, and it is behind the house where his mother would baby-sit Taylor and her brother for many years. A table in the studio holds a selection of the thousands of photos he shot of Taylor. Slides from when she was four; promotional shots from her first days in Nashville.\n\nOrth, now 56 with a stubble beard and black rectangle glasses, lived in Los Angeles for two decades, shot prominent actors and directors, has a frame of reference that extends well beyond these Shillington hills.\n\n“It’s all about taking direction,” Orth says of being photographed. “Some people listen, and some people don’t. (Taylor) was in the zone. There are people who have a natural charisma, and no doubt, she had it.”\n\nOrth is standing over the table of Swift, which takes her from childhood to the verge of stardom. He believes that he made a meaningful contribution to her image, which began during annual visits from L.A.\n\n“I would come back, and Taylor would come running over here, wrap her arms around my legs and say, you’re my favorite photographer,'” Orth says. “I guess she got the Hollywood disease. I don’t know what it was, but she thought it was the be-all and end-all, where I came from.”\n\nHe is disappointed to have lost touch, and hopes to reconnect and shoot her again.\n\n“She was this beautiful little girl,” Orth says. “If you can look beyond the shot, and understand that a little 4-year-old doesn’t do this sort of thing unless they’re listening so intently. When it came to shooting, we just totally connected, and it continued through the years.”\n\nThe relationship continued into the Swifts’ early years in the Nashville suburb of Hendersonville, Tenn., where Orth would stay at the family home during his periodic trips.\n\nAnd then? Well . . .\n\n“As she got bigger, I kind of vanished,” he says. “So yeah, there’s that element of ‘what’s going on here?'”\n\nReality struck Orth in a Denny’s outside of Tulsa in 2007, during a cross-country drive home from L.A. Swift had given a concert in the area, and all the waitresses and cooks were wearing the same T-shirt purchased at the show. On it: Surprise! A photograph he had taken.\n\n“I remember having to take my hamburger to go,” Orth says. “I texted Andrea ‘great going, good luck.’ And that was it.”\n\n***\n\nIn the winter of 1961, an unknown who until recently had been named Robert Zimmerman rode into New York, carrying all kinds of myths. He was an orphan. He’d traveled across the country in a freight train. Anything to escape Hibbing, Minn., and write his way out of the tangle of details that made reality.\n\nHe created a person called Bob Dylan, who went onto become a protest singer, rocker, country gentleman, evangelist, you name it.\n\nTaylor Swift hit Nashville in 2004 with her own tidy stories in development. At only 25, she has spent time as a country star, a pop queen, and now New York City’s ambassador for tourism, of all things. Icons have creation myths, and forever play characters. The great ones make it work over and over and over.\n\nPeople in Wyomissing, Shillington and Reading are savvy. They understand all this. But when asked about the Swifts — well, you can see what the answers contain. A complex blend of pride, yearning and resentment.\n\n“I wouldn’t have cared if I ever got a dime,” Ronnie Cremer says, conceding that he has received the platinum album and a $5,000 guitar from the Swifts, and was paid for all the work he did for the family.\n\n“It just would have been nice — it would have helped me out if I would have just gotten a little bit of, Ronnie Cremer taught her. That would have been nice. That would have been a nice gesture.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift interview: 'A relationship? No one’s going to sign up for this'\nIn an exclusive interview, the Shake It Off star talks to The Telegraph about sex, the Swifties and her friendship with Ed Sheeran\n\nTaylor Swift is not only the biggest pop star on the planet, but also the biggest worrier. Right now she is worrying about this interview – her first major sit-down chat of the year. She has just come from a production meeting for her forth­coming world tour, fretting about the set list, sight lines and how to get her piano to the right part of the stage at the right time. Before that, when she woke up, she was immediately gripped with anxiety about something she said last night (even though it was only using the word ‘interjection’ when she meant ‘injection’). ‘I worry about everything all the time,’ she says with a grin. ‘We could do our entire interview me telling you how many things I’ve worried about since breakfast. “The Neuroses of Taylor Swift” is probably going to be the article headline.’\n\nMost pop stars of Swift’s stature pay other people to worry about these things. And while the buzz of activity as we arrive at the well-appointed Beverly Hills house being used by Team Swift for their production meeting indicates that she has no shortage of people looking out for her, she remains hands-on with every aspect of her career.\n\nBut then the one thing she doesn’t need to worry about is how that career is going. It is Grammys weekend when we meet, and although Swift is attending rather than performing, she is still going to be the centre of attention.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons. She is the only artist ever to sell more than a million first-week US copies of three separate albums – Speak Now in 2010, Red in 2012, and 1989, released in October, which racked up the biggest first-week American sales since 2002 and went to number one around the world, including the UK, where it was the best-selling album by an international artist last year. Its lead single, Shake It Off, was an iTunes number one in 64 countries. She is the first artist since the Beatles to spend six or more weeks at number one in the United States with three consecutive albums (at the time of writing, 1989 is into its 11th week at the top).\n\nHer cultural weight – 52.8 million Twitter followers, 22.1 million on Instagram and 74.4 million likes on Facebook – means that she can break acts with a single tweet, and she regularly shines that spotlight on new artists she enjoys. Her removal of her back catalogue from Spotify resulted in the music-streaming company’s CEO, Daniel Ek, justifying its entire business model. ‘I didn’t think it was going to be international news or affect a public offering,’ she claims. ‘If I have an opinion on something, I act accordingly – and I believe music is valuable.’\n\nDoes she think future artists will sell records like this again? ‘It’s possible,’ she says. ‘We all have to step up and make albums that are good, top to bottom, if selling albums is still important. It is to me, but a lot of artists have already given up on that. I have friends who just think it’s not attainable, which I feel is a very defeatist way to look at life.’\n\nAnd defeatism is not the Swift way. Her infectious can-do attitude is evident from the moment she greets me brightly at the door, wearing an elegant dress, with her hair swept back. Despite knowing her height (5ft 10in), I find her taller than I expected and slimmer, too. Swift has ordered in coffee, apologising for the lack of tea (‘You’re British! I should’ve known!’) and peppers conversation with first-name references to her famous friends.\n\nSingle after a string of high-profile relationships with men such as Harry Styles, Jake Gyllenhaal and Taylor Lautner, she has recruited a ‘squad’ of high-achieving close girlfriends, and spends what little downtime she gets baking with the supermodel Karlie Kloss, strolling around New York with the Girls actress and writer Lena Dunham or, as her recent Instagram posts indicate, whale-watching in Hawaii with the indie band Haim. ‘The thing about my girlfriends right now is that none of them needs me for anything other than friendship,’ she says. ‘I love the fact that they are all passionate about their jobs, whatever their jobs are. A lot of celebrity-type people have this group of people around them where their friends’ main priority is them, and they feel comfortable with that dynamic. I don’t feel comfortable with that dynamic.’\n\nTaylor Alison Swift was born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, on December 13 1989 (13 is her lucky number). She spent her early years on a Christmas-tree farm run as a side business by her parents. Her father, Scott, is a wealth management adviser with Merrill Lynch; her mother, Andrea, worked at a mutual fund before becoming a full-time mother to Taylor and her younger brother, Austin. While at school in Pennsylvania Taylor often appeared in musical productions, local fairs and talent shows; and her love of country music was sparked by Shania Twain, perhaps the last country superstar to cross over to the pop charts as successfully as Swift.\n\nThe Swifts moved to Nashville, the home of country music, when their daughter was 15. Taylor and her mother had four years earlier hawked a demo CD around Nashville’s Music Row, going door-to-door in search of a break. Shortly after the family was uprooted, that break arrived. Swift became the youngest songwriter ever to be signed to Sony/ATV Music Publishing, and a year later a record deal followed with the fledgling label Big Machine, which released her eponymous debut album in 2006. Crucially, she became one of the first country artists to use the internet to market herself, expanding her reach beyond the genre’s traditional heartlands to recruit an army of teenage girl fans.\n\nBy the time of her second album, Fearless, in 2008, Swift was already shifting away from country (its lead single, Love Story, became her first hit in the UK, where she was marketed as a pop artist). Fearless made her the youngest ever winner of the album of the year Grammy (in 2010) and the first country star to win an MTV video award (best female video for You Belong with Me in 2009). Her acceptance speech was interrupted by the rapper Kanye West, who stormed the stage incensed that Beyoncé hadn’t won. Swift was devastated, but the incident catapulted her to mainstream attention. Barack Obama was moved to call West a ‘jackass’.\n\nHer subsequent albums Speak Now and Red were progressively a little less country, a little more pop, but she has remained popular in Nashville. In 2013 she became the second ever winner of the Country Music Association’s Pinnacle Award, its highest honour. The previous winner, Garth Brooks, was in his mid-40s when he won – Swift was 23.\n\nThe Grammy Museum in Los Angeles has an entire floor dedicated to her story. There, footage of her singing Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star as a toddler, belting out the national anthem at sports events as a child and improvising a song about traffic for a country radio station as a teenager reveal that she has undoubtedly always been talented, if not prodigiously so. ‘I’m really lucky I got 10 years of practice in before we reached this point,’ she says. ‘I’ve climbed a lot of flights of stairs, rather than got a speed elevator. [Nowadays] an artist is just shot out of a cannon into the stratosphere.’\n\nBefore the release of 1989 Swift moved to New York. She cut her trademark long, blond hair and embraced feminism, although not, she says, as ‘some strategy – being a feminist is just part of my life’. She started going out drinking more, gradually easing away from the prim image that defined her teenage years, although she stresses, ‘My point is not to be sexy, my point is not to turn masses of people on.’ And she made a determined attempt to cause a ‘change in the narrative’ that had portrayed her as some sort of serial-dating bunny-boiler (an idea her song Blank Space skewers deliciously, by writing from the perspective of that character). ‘There was a bit of a reputation for having a lot of boy-bashing songs,’ she says, referring to the likes of I Knew You Were Trouble and Should’ve Said No. ‘Which is a sexist way of saying heartbreak songs. To trivialise someone who’s heartbroken is really cruel. But people have to simplify things,’ she says. ‘Everybody’s got busy lives, they don’t have time to form a complex opinion of me and my music. I’m in a different place in my life, where love isn’t really a priority. I haven’t dated anyone in years so there’s less chatter about the serial dater thing. I’m just really excited at an awards show when they don’t make some weird joke about my dating life.’\n\nThe other night she was photographed out with the Irish singer-songwriter Andrew Hozier-Byrne and some other friends, and she became anxious about what the gossip sites would say the next day. ‘I just got so freaked out that people were going to say I was dating him,’ she says. ‘I started thinking, “I can’t let this ruin my friendships with dudes.” I didn’t let it ruin my friendship with Ed [Sheeran] – they always said we were dating and we never were. But sometimes I get really scared.’\n\nThere was a time when Swift would refuse to use the internet for fear of what she might see (‘It’s very difficult to know people have the wrong impression of you and you can’t do anything to correct it’), but now she spends a lot of time online, interacting with the Swifties, her hardcore fans. ‘Not in a way that’s like, having sycophantic worshippers,’ she stresses. ‘My fans make fun of me – it’s really cool. They have all these Gifs of me making an idiot of myself or tripping and falling on stage. They bring humour back into it for me. I get too serious sometimes – you can probably tell – and they bring me back to like, “OK, I’m not really doing anything that difficult. I just need to calm down.” ’\n\nBased on what she learns from ‘lurking’ on their social-media profiles, Swift has made fans post-break-up playlists, paid off their student loans and sent gifts for Christmas and Valentine’s Day, accompanied by handwritten notes. You would assume she has people to do this for her, but she insists she does it all herself (‘I don’t take it to FedEx, but I pack the box and tape it – I have so much bubble wrap in my house!’).\n\n‘I love them,’ she says of her fans. ‘They are cool and smart and hilarious and focused on the right things. I want to make the most of this cultural relevance or success or whatever you want to call it, because it’s not going to last. I have to be as good a person [as I can] while my name matters to them. Because it’s not always going to matter to kids who are 15 and really struggling with who they want to be or [because] their friends were brutal to them at school that day. That’s actual turmoil. I have to do everything I can to make their day better while I still can. [Sending presents] is fun for me. If I go a week without sending something, I start to feel sad. I’m getting to know them on a person-by-person basis. When I pick people to send packages to, I go on their social-media sites for the last six months and figure out what they like or what they are going through. Do they like photography? I’ll get them a 1980s Polaroid camera. Do they like vintage stuff? I’ll go to an antiques place and get them 1920s earrings. Do they work out a lot? I’ll get them workout stuff. When you actually get to know them on a person-by-person basis, you realise what you’re doing is special and sacred and it matters.’\n\nIt is impossible to imagine other pop stars spending time doing all this. Can she really be this nice all the time? ‘No, because that’s annoying, too,’ she says, laughing. ‘And it’s not real if someone appears to never have any issues with anyone. I have my friends, I have enemies. I have bad days when I don’t want to go to a photo shoot, but I’m not going to show up four hours late, I’m going to be there on time. I’m not nice all the time but I try not to be carelessly rude to people who don’t deserve it.\n\n‘When I’m with my friends, we don’t say glowing things about everybody,’ she says, grinning conspiratorially. ‘We’re not sitting around going [adopts Stepford Wives-esque voice and posture], “You know who’s really special and wonderful?” That’s not what we talk about – we’re normal girlfriends.’\n\nBut just whom they might be talking about in that way, Swift is not prepared to share. The gossip sites’ one-time fascination with her love life may have been temporarily frustrated, but it threatens to be replaced by interest in her apparent feud with Katy Perry, the rumoured subject of a track on 1989, Bad Blood. ‘I’m not giving them anything to write about,’ she says, smiling steelily. ‘I’m not walking up the street with boys, I’m not stumbling out of clubs drunk. But I’m never going to talk about her in my interview. It’s not going to happen.’\n\nInstead, Swift is concentrating on trying, in her words, ‘to create a beautiful life’. That life would appear to have no room in it for a significant other right now. She likes to ‘play the tape of her life forward’ when she’s making decisions. But ask her what the tape looks like if you fast-forward five years and she seems less certain. ‘I’ll be 30,’ she gasps. ‘I’ll probably still be single, let’s be honest. No one’s going to sign up for this and everything that goes with it. Like, “Hi, nice to meet you, want a date? Do you love camera flashes? I hope you do!” I don’t know what’s going to happen if I’m ever content in a relationship – no idea how that’s going to work,’ she continues, still smiling. ‘I don’t even know if that’s possible with the life I have.\n\n‘“In five years’ time she’ll be so afraid of everything, she doesn’t leave her house,”’ she says, laughing self-mockingly. ‘“She’s just surrounded by cats. So many cats, they’ve divided themselves up into armies and she wanders around lint-rolling the couch that no one’s going to sit on because she’s afraid to have people over…”’\n\nSwift is not even sure she’ll have made another album by the time 2020 rolls around. ‘I’m not going to put out an album until I’ve made one that’s better than this one and that’s going to be really hard,’ she says. And how might her music evolve if she does find love? ‘If that does happen, I think I could find complexity in happiness,’ she says. ‘I don’t think anything’s ever simple. Just because you’re happy in a relationship doesn’t mean that there aren’t moments of confusion or frustration or loneliness or sadness. Hopefully, if I ever find some sort of meaningful relationship, I’ll be able to still find inspiration, just through the everyday ups and downs.’\n\nFor now, though, her life is mapped out indefinitely. As we start to leave she runs through her schedule for the rest of the day: watch the fan reaction videos to her latest batch of gift-giving, work out, go to a dress-fitting, more meetings, then a pre-Grammy party. Tomorrow she will attend the actual Grammys with her best friend from high school, Abigail Anderson, a charity worker. (Despite three nominations – record of the year, song of the year, and best pop solo performance, all for Shake It Off – she won’t add to her four Grammys, but will still look as if she’s having more fun than anyone else.) She has a Brit Awards performance to plan and a new single (Style) to release. The 1989 World Tour kicks off in May, including a date at the British Summer Time Festival in Hyde Park in June.\n\n‘I used to think it was important to find a boyfriend,’ she says before politely taking her leave. ‘But I don’t feel that it is now. I just want to have as much fun and as many adventures as possible.’ And for once, you suspect, she really doesn’t need to worry.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift reveals the last time she was thoroughly unpleasant to someone\n\nThe Telegraph gets nosey and asks the world's biggest star a few questions we've always wanted answering\n\nThe Telegraph was recently granted an audience with Taylor Swift, music's biggest star and nicest person. You can read the exclusive interview here. We also had a few extra questions to put to the 25-year-old superstar...\n\nWhen was the last time you were thoroughly unpleasant to someone?\n\nTaylor Swift: \"The other night. I was mean to this guy, but only because he was doing this thing that I’ve heard about in the [Neil Strauss] book The Game. We were all seeing a show and he comes up and he was doing that compliment-criticism thing, where you say you like my hair then you say, 'Where did you get that hairdye? I can see your roots'. It’s a thing guys do if they’re trying to hit on a girl and they want to bring her down a bit so she craves their positive attention. So I kind of went off on him like, ‘You think people don’t know what you’re doing? You legitimately think I’m an idiot. Everybody’s read that book!'\"\n\nWhat was the last text message you received?\n\n(Checks phone) \"It’s from Ed [Sheeran]! It says, 'You’re sitting right next to me and Haim [at the Grammys] it looks like'. Yes, oh my God! I’m happy we’ve got a really good crew this year, it’s like me, Sam [Smith], Haim, Ed – that’s a good enough crew. We all know each other, we all like each other, those are all good people who will be up and dancing.\"\n\nWhat was the last book you read?\n\n\"Ava Gardner: The Secret Conversations, by Peter Evans. It’s a book this journalist wrote about Ava Gardner, the time he spent with her, her eccentricities and her stories from old Hollywood. It’s fascinating.\"\n\nWhat was the last album you loved?\n\n\"Do EPs count? I really like Borns’ Candy EP and all of James Bay’s EPs. I saw James in concert last night – well, it wasn’t a concert, it was an industry showcase, but it was really good.’\n\nWhat was the last movie you saw?\n\n\"The Imitation Game, with Benedict Cumberbatch. Oh my god, it’s so amazing – you have to see it.\"\n\nWhen was the last time you laughed out loud?\n\n\"Last night. I was just drinking – I laugh a lot when I drink. I think everything’s funny then. Me and Abigail [Anderson, her best friend from High School] were out having sushi and it was really good and we thought that was hilarious. It doesn’t take much.\"\n\nAnd when was the last time you cried?\n\n“When I was watching one of my fan’s present-opening videos. He’s a British guy called Johnnie that I sent Valentine’s Day presents to, he’s 16 and literally the most precious human. It’s not sad or anything, but at the end he does this thank you to me and I was just like 'Ooh'.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Elle preview: TAYLOR SWIFT HAS NO REGRETS\nThe record-setting pop star opens up to her bestie Tavi Gevinson about matters of the head, heart, and everything in between.\nWho better to get to the heart of the phenomenon that is Taylor Swift than one of her besties? For ELLE's June Women in Music Issue cover story, Tavi Gevinson sat down with Swift to talk about matters of the head, heart, and everything in between. Pick up the June issue on newsstands nationwide on May 19 to read the entire interview. Below, check out a sneak peek of their conversation.Since the age of 14, I have littered—excuse me, adorned—the Internet with Taylor Swift analyses. I was first struck by how much more agency she had over her songwriting and public image than other popular artists tapping into my demo, and by how it felt to get permission from a girl wielding a guitar to shamelessly express one's emotions, despite how often doing so can get you called \"crazy\" (that sexist euphemism for \"feminine\"). With the release of her fourth album,Red, in 2012 and a handful of highly publicized romances, Taylor was criticized by the press and other entertainers for such sinful acts as dating people and writing songs about it, gaining a reputation as boy-crazy and love-ridden. But I'd always felt that the men in her songs were mere catalysts for her own self-discovery. Last October she released 1989, and if you use the Internet or ever leave the house, you're familiar with its ubiquity. But I would like to draw attention to the secret message spelled out in the liner notes of \"Clean,\" the final track: \"She lost him but she found herself and somehow that was everything.\"\n\nTaylor's first four albums have been certified platinum a combined 21 times, but despite her unprecedented success in country music, 1989 is strictly pop. The same woman who once landed a nonsingle called \"Forever and Always\" on the Top 40 charts now declares, in \"Wildest Dreams,\" \"Nothing lasts forever.\" Yet her storytelling and the attention to detail that she honed in country are what make her pop songs peerless. She's 25 now, and with her newfound perspective on romance's expiration date, she's also gained appreciation for the joy of a fling's impermanence, recovering from heartbreak, and reinventing oneself. \"Find out what you want/Be that girl for a month\" refers to the preferences of a lover in \"Blank Space\" but could just as well apply to her own evolution. 1989 debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 charts and sold almost 1.3 million copies in the first week. It was the top-selling album of 2014 and outsold her previous two albums in the U.S. after just 19 weeks in release.Taylor and I first met in 2012, but you can't go over to a friend's apartment to make chili and be like, \"But first, real quick: Is it 'Starbucks lovers'?\" However, in the name of journalism, I talked to Taylor the morning of this year's Grammys at her house in L.A. about all of the above.\n\nOn getting over a guy:\nTavi Gevinson: I want to ask you about \"Clean.\" The girl singing is so sensible, with none of the impulsiveness of \"Blank Space\" or \"Style.\"\nTaylor Swift: \"Shake It Off\" and \"Clean\" were the last two things we wrote for the record, so it shows you where I ended up mentally. \"Clean\" I wrote as I was walking out of Liberty in London. Someone I used to date—it hit me that I'd been in the same city as him for two weeks and I hadn't thought about it. When it did hit me, it was like, Oh, I hope he's doing well. And nothing else. And you know how it is when you're going through heartbreak. A heartbroken person is unlike any other person. Their time moves at a completely different pace than ours. It's this mental, physical, emotional ache and feeling so conflicted. Nothing distracts you from it. Then time passes, and the more you live your life and create new habits, you get used to not having a text message every morning saying, \"Hello, beautiful. Good morning.\" You get used to not calling someone at night to tell them how your day was. You replace these old habits with new habits, like texting your friends in a group chat all day and planning fun dinner parties and going out on adventures with your girlfriends, and then all of a sudden one day you're in London and you realize you've been in the same place as your ex for two weeks and you're fine. And you hope he's fine. The first thought that came to my mind was, I'm finally clean. I'd been in this media hailstorm of people having a very misconstrued perception of who I was. There were really insensitive jokes being made at awards shows by hosts; there were snarky headlines in the press—\"Taylor Goes Through a Breakup: Well, That Was Swift!\"—focusing on all the wrong things.\n\nOn happily ever after and what Lena Dunham has taught her about love:\nTG: Can you tell me more about how the way you go about songwriting has changed?\nTS: I'd never been in a relationship when I wrote my first couple of albums, so these were all projections of what I thought they might be like. They were based on movies and books and songs and literature that tell us that a relationship is the most magical thing that can ever happen to you. And then once I fell in love, or thought I was in love, and then experienced disappointment or it just not working out a few times, I realized there's this idea of happily ever after which in real life doesn't happen. There's no riding off into the sunset, because the camera always keeps rolling in real life. It's magical if you ask anyone who has ever fallen in love—it's the greatest. Now I have more of a grasp on the fact that when you're in a state of infatuation and you think everything that person does is perfect, it then—if you're lucky—morphs into a real relationship when you see that that person is not in fact perfect, but you still want to see them every day.\n\nTG: That's why I love that the height of your song \"You Are in Love\" is the lyric: \"You're my best friend.\" That's the best.\nTS: Yeah. I've never had that, so I wrote that song about things that Lena [Dunham] has told me about her and Jack [Antonoff]. That's just basically stuff she's told me. And I think that that kind of relationship—God, it sounds like it would just be so beautiful—would also be hard. It would also be mundane at times.\nOn having no regrets:\nTG: …I think that when people who've had success from a young age go through a train-wreck cycle, it's usually because they're working on someone else's terms, so they feel the need to rebel. But when it's something you've built, you don't have that same kind of resentment or angstiness. But it's also difficult to keep those standards for yourself. Do you ever really worry that you're going to accidentally say something inflammatory?\nTS: Not necessarily. As far as the need to rebel against the idea of you, or the image of you: Like, I feel no need to burn down the house I built by hand. I can make additions to it. I can redecorate. But I built this. And so I'm not going to sit there and say, \"Oh, I wish I hadn't had corkscrew-curly hair and worn cowboy boots and sundresses to awards shows when I was 17; I wish I hadn't gone through that fairy-tale phase where I just wanted to wear princess dresses to awards shows every single time.\" Because I made those choices. I did that. It was part of me growing up. It wasn't some committee going, \"You know what Taylor needs to be this year?\" And so with 1989, I feel like we gave the entire metaphorical house I built a complete renovation and it made me love the house even more—but still keeping the foundation of what I've always been.\n\n  For the full interview, pick up ELLE's June issue, on national newsstands May 19.

      "Transcript/Content": "[WIP] This is getting good now!\nSince the age of 14, I have littered-excuse me, adorned the Internet with Taylor Swift analyses. I was first struck by how much more agency she had over her songwriting and public image than other popular artists tapping into my demo, and by how it felt to get permission from a girl wielding a guitar to shamelessly express one's emotions, despite how often doing so can get you called \"crazy\" (that sexist euphemism for \"femi- nine\"). With the release of her fourth album, Red, in 2012 and a handful of highly publicized romances, Taylor was criticized by the press and other entertainers for such sinful acts as dat ing people and writing songs about it, gaining a reputation as boy-crazy and love-ridden. But I'd always felt that the men in her songs were mere catalysts for her own self-discovery. Last October she released 1989, and if you use the Internet or ever leave the house, you're familiar with its ubiquity. But I would like to draw attention to the secret message spelled out in the liner notes of \"Clean,\" the final track: \"She lost him but she found herself and somehow that was everything.\"\nTaylor's first four albums have been certified platinum a combined 21 times, but despite her unprecedented success in country music, 1989 is strictly pop. The same woman who once landed a nonsingle called \"Forever and Always\" on the Top 40 charts now declares, in \"Wildest Dreams,\" \"Nothing lasts for ever.\" Yet her storytelling and the attention to detail that she honed in country are what make her pop songs peerless. She's 25 now, and with her newfound perspective on romance's expi ration date, she's also gained appreciation for the joy of a fling's impermanence, recovering from heartbreak, and reinventing oneself. \"Find out what you want/Be that girl for a month\" re fers to the preferences of a lover in \"Blank Space\" but could just as well apply to her own evolution. 1989 debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 charts and sold almost 1.3 million cop ies in the first week. It was the top-selling album of 2014 and outsold her previous two albums in the U.S. after just 19 weeks in release.\nTaylor and I first met in 2012, but you can't go over to a friend's apartment to make chili and be like, \"But first, real quick: Is it 'Starbucks lovers?\" However, in the name of journal ism, I talked to Taylor the morning of this year's Grammys at her house in L.A. about all of the above.\nTAVI GEVINSON: Lena Dunham once said that she didn't feel like showing her body on TV is brave because bravery is doing something you're afraid of, and it's not scary for her. Is it easy for you to share so much in your work? Or is it a fear that you had to get over?\nTAYLOR SWIFT: It definitely doesn't feel scary to me to write songs about my personal life. It actually feels like the only way I've ever processed emotions. Like, a lot of people have a diary where they write whatever they want, and that helps them get it out without screaming at somebody. I have a big priority placed on not being the type of person who takes out my problems on people around me. I also know that even though the media's going to assign characters to each of these songs, I'll never con- firm who these songs are about. That's the one bit of protective armor that I have: That's my secret-I know what happened, I'm going to tell my version of events in my albums, and that's the real account of what happened.\nTG: What is scary to you?\nTS: Oh my God, well, lots of things. One thing I've gotten a little better at is the idea that I could do one thing wrong and all of this would completely disappear. Like, all of my work from my entire life, every album I've put out in the last 10 years, all of it would be wiped from the record and no one would appreci ate what I've done that's good. Because if you watch celebrity culture, it happens, you know? Someone says something crazy in an interview or is caught stumbling out of a club drunk too many times when they're thought to be America's sweetheart. People can feel betrayed very easily by celebrities. And one thing that used to really scare me a lot is making my fans feel like they don't know me. So I have to be easier on myself about this. Because the reason I don't stumble out of clubs drunk is because I don't really feel like doing that, like, on a Wednesday night, you know? And the reason why I don't say crazy, inflam matory things in interviews is because I don't have that many inflammatory thoughts. Of course, when I sit down with my friends, like when you and I have lunch and stuff, I tell you all the people who bother me or are horrible to me or are giving me crazy side-eye at a party. But I'm not going to say that in an interview. So I just have to trust this isn't going to just disappear. But it's scary to me that I can somehow get bad press for some- thing I didn't do, or my label changes a policy and I get blamed for it, or there's a new music [legislative] bill that would affect my beliefs and all of a sudden I'm in a headline-you know, there's some copyright thing happening with a T-shirt and I'm in the headline. It's interesting how many different ways they can pull your name into things that you had nothing directly\nto do with. IG I interviewed Emma Watson a couple of years ago. She said, \"People praise me for being some kind of role model because I don't stumble out of clubs drunk, but I honestly just don't feel like it.\"\n15: Here's the thing: Every girl, every woman, has different pri- orities, different things that make them feel powerful or strong, or sexy, or special, or unique. It's just so strange to think that we would all have the same triggers, the same priorities, and that we'd all have the same definitions of fun.\nTG: And the same weaknesses. I think that when people who've had success from a young age go through a train-wreck cycle, it's usually because they're working on someone else's terms, so they feel the need to rebel. But when it's something you've built, you don't have that same kind of resentment or angsti ness. But it's also difficult to keep those standards for yourself. Do you ever really worry that you're going to accidentally say something inflammatory?\n15: Not necessarily. As far as the need to rebel against the idea\nof you, or the image of you: Like, I feel no need to burn down the house I built by hand. I can make additions to it. I can re- decorate. But I built this. And so I'm not going to sit there and say, \"Oh, I wish I hadn't had corkscrew-curly hair and worn cowboy boots and sundresses to awards shows when I was 17; I wish I hadn't gone through that fairy-tale phase where I just wanted to wear princess dresses to awards shows every single\ntime.\" Because I made those choices. I did that. It was part of me growing up. It wasn't some committee going. \"You know what Taylor needs to be this year?\" And so with 1989, I feel like we gave the entire metaphorical house I built a complete. renovation and it made me love the house even more-but still keeping the foundation of what I've always been.\nIG I can make myself crazy looking at things from when I was younger. How do you give yourself permission to change? TS: You just have to have faith in the fact that everything is a\nprocess. I'm really happy with today, the end result of what my life looks like. I love my friends. I love my fans. I love what I know I stand for. I love my lyrics. I'm proud of what I've done. I'm proud of this album more so than anything I've ever done before. So I look back and think about, like, let's take my album Red. That was sort of a patchwork quilt of me still loving coun try music but finding this new love for pop music, and trying to make that work on one album. Is it a sonically cohesive album? No. Was it necessary to take me from my first three albums to where I am now with 1989? Yes. God, I was telling my mom this yesterday when I was putting together a package for this British fan-I was writing her notes and stuff, my mom was helping me wrap presents-and she goes, \"Remember last year?\" Last year Red was nominated for Album of the Year. You go into Grammy week thinking, I'm not going to win and I'm fine with that and I have enough happiness and success. And if I don't win, I won't be sad. And then everybody comes up to you at these functions and they go, \"You know you're going to win Album of the Year, you know you're going to win Album of the Year; I voted for you for Album of the Year, you're going to win; you're going to win.\" And so then you start getting hopeful. So we go to the awards and they're announcing the winner for Album of the Year-last award of the night-and the presenter says, \"Album of the Year: RRRRRandom Access Memories, Daft Punk!\" And for the first millisecond I thought they were saying Red. And, you know, you clap because you support other people and all that. And then I didn't want to go to after-parties. I just wanted to lay in a blanket and eat an In-N-Out burger on my couch. I found myself wanting something that anybody would want, and I was really bummed. My backup singers texted me and said, \"Hey, are you okay?\" I wrote, \"I'm okay, but I'd love some company.\" So they come over, and I was like, \"Hey, do you want to hear I\nsomething I wrote this week?\" And I played them the demo of \"Welcome to New York.\" And they look at me and go, \"This is an '80s throwback song-you're using all '80s sounds on this.\" And I was like, \"Wow, I didn't really think about that, but I'd been doing that on every song I've made for this record so far.\" go to sleep, and I wake up in the middle of the night at three in the morning and sit up straight, like out of a movie, and just go, \"1989. It's called 1989\" That moment wouldn't have happened if I had won Album of the Year. So many things would be dif ferent if I hadn't experienced failure the way I live my life and my resilience-and if I hadn't been harshly criticized every step of the way. So that's what gives me faith that even if you made a mistake in the past, or you didn't do something quite as well as you wanted to, these are things we learn from it's not useless. move through the world?\nIG: I was talking with a friend the other day about writing, be cause I've journaled or written publicly every day since I was very young. And I said, \"I think I have to stop because it's dis tancing me from the world.\" My friend was like, \"No, no. It's the thing that connects you to the world!\" How do you feel like the habit of songwriting affects the way that you experience life and\n15. The joke that people always make to me when they don't know what to say-like, some 16-year-old comes up to me and asks me for a picture and her dad's, like, standing with her be cause they're at the mall-is: \"You're gonna write a song about this, aren't ya?\" TG: Oh no.....\n15: Literally, I've had people say \"You're gonna write a song about this, aren't you?\" every day for the last 10 years of my life. But I don't write songs about things that happen to me in my daily life that don't deeply affect me emotionally. You know how you have those phases where you think about an ex that happened years ago, and all of a sudden you're thinking about it again-that can happen to me and I'll write a song about that. It's not like I have to be talking to a dude to write songs, or",

      "Transcript/Content": "What It's Really Like To Star In A Music Video With Taylor Swift\nHow To Star In A Taylor Swift Video, According To The 'Style' Guy\nMatthew Jacobs\n\nMar 2, 2015, 11:50 AM EST | Updated Dec 6, 2017\n\nDominic Sherwood has appeared in \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" \"Not Fade Away\" and \"Vampire Academy,\" but his big break came when Taylor Swift's \"Style\" video premiered last month. He plays the guy with the James Dean daydream look in his (dual-colored) eyes. What's it like to shoot a Taylor Swift music video, you ask? HuffPost Entertainment went straight to the source: The 25-year-old English actor, who shot the clip across four days last summer in Los Angeles, took us from first text message (from Swift herself, a friend of Sherwood's) through the explosion that flooded his Twitter feed after the video's launch.\n\nHow did you first get linked up with the \"Style\" video?\nI’ve known Taylor for a little over a year now. We met through mutual friends. About a month before the video was supposed to start filming, she texted me and asked me if I would ever consider being in a music video. I literally had just finished a movie at the time and I said, “Well, it depends who it was for and what sort of stuff I would be doing.” And she said, “Well, it would be for me.” And I said, “Oh, wow.” I was really, really flattered that she would even think of me and consider me for it. I’d met the director once or twice before, Kyle Newman. It was all very exciting, even before I knew what I was doing exactly.\n\nWas making out with Taylor part of the initial pitch?\nYou know, what’s interesting is that we didn’t. If you watch the video again, we don’t make out. Trust me, I would know if we’d made out, absolutely. It was something that we spoke about, me and Taylor and Kyle. She wanted to have it more insinuated. Everything is more smoke and mirror-y than directly there on the screen. We actually never make out at any point.\n\nThe song is about a James Dean lookalike. Is that how Taylor would describe you?\nTaylor said I kind of fit the person they’d like in the video. I think I had a lot of the attributes that she wanted and that she described in her lyrics. And when we met and when we’ve hung out, a lot of the stuff I was wearing, that’s how I dress.\n\nWas \"Style\" playing on loop as you filmed?\nIt’s always playing in the background, but it’s interesting because a lot of times it’s played in double speed. Still to this day, I’m not really sure why that happens. I think it might be something to do with slowing it down for the frame rate -- something like that. When I heard it for the first time on the radio, I was like, “It’s a bit slow, isn’t it? A bit different?” And then I realized they play it twice as fast whilst we’re filming.\n\nYou're a fit guy anyway, but did you do any prep to get in shape for the shirtless scenes?\nI’d just come off the back of a movie called “Take Down” where I had to be quite physically fit. I trained quite hard for that. It was a few months after I’d wrapped “Take Down” that Taylor spoke to me about this. I was kind of out of condition. I hadn’t been working out and she sent me the storyboard and I was like, “Oh God, I’m shirtless in a lot of it. Okay, cool, back to the gym, I guess.” We actually didn’t have all that much time. I think I had about two or three weeks of really working out properly to get back into shape. I worked quite hard. I was in the gym maybe four times a week, five times a week.\n\nYour face is often superimposed on Taylor's clothes or hands or on a mirror. Did you have to film anything special for that?\nNo, so this was what was so interesting about it: Day 1, we filmed in almost, like, a tent. They filmed my face and my eyes and all of the things you see on Taylor and on her dress and all the mirror stuff. Then for the rest of the shoot, we did it with projections live on set. The mirror stuff is all done in postproduction, but the projections where I’m on her dress or she’s projected onto me, that was all done live on set with a projector. It was great. It was actually nice to see it happening firsthand because a lot of the movies I’ve been on, it’s all done in post. You never actually get to see the product until you go and see the film at the premiere or until you get a screener of it, so it was actually really cool to see it happening live in front of you.\n\nWhen did you first see the video?\nEveryone wanted to keep it quiet. I’d seen little snippets, but I hadn’t seen the entire video until it got released.\n\nWhat's the response been like? Do you feel like a changed man?\nNo, no, not at all. My Twitter had a bit of an explosion, which was cool. That’s kind of all it was. It absolutely hasn’t changed me at all. When it came out, I was in the middle of filming a movie anyway, so I was focused on that. I went back to my trailer and my phone had exploded and I was like, “Wow, I guess the video’s been released and that’s why my phone is behaving the way it’s behaving.” We’ve had such a positive response to the video, especially because it is so different from anything Taylor has done before. Taylor and Kyle and her team did an amazing job at kind of reinventing the wheel where she’s really reimagined and elaborated on what she can do as an artist.\n\nMusic-video stars are notoriously sex symbol-ish. Your Twitter feed must have been filled with comments about that.\nYeah, there’s a lot of articulation of that, especially my eyes. It’s pretty obvious in the video that my eyes are different colors, and they actually are. That’s how my eyes are. There was a lot of response about my eyes and people questioning whether it was real or whether it was done for the video. They are real. I can tell everyone right now.\n\nIt’s like #TheDress.\nThat’s so interesting -- that’s what me and Taylor were speaking about yesterday. People feel they’re being ocularly tricked by my eyes. But no, they’re actually blue and brown. I’m not trying to trick anyone.\n\nHow much have you seen Taylor since shooting?\nI actually haven’t seen her since wrapping the video. She’s so busy slowly but surely taking over the world. But we do speak every now and then.\n\nDo you have a favorite Taylor Swift song?\nIf I said anything other than “Style,” I’d look like a royal idiot, wouldn’t I? I actually like “Blank Space.” We had a bit of a running joke after I did the video because of Sean O'Pry, who is the guy in “Black Space.\" Every time the video or the song would come on, my friends would turn to me and go, “I’d hate to be the guy in the next video because he’s very good-looking, that Sean guy.” I was like, “Yeah, thanks, you’re great. Thanks for having my back.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Watch Taylor Swift Get Her \"Shorty Wanna Ride\" Rap On\n\nAshley Rose\nApr 25, 2015 3:12am\n\nTaylor Swift gave us a huge blast from the past when she accepted her Shorty Award for Best Singer earlier this week. She busted out her inner rap star and you won't believe what song she spit.\n\nWe've seen her bust out her inner swizzle for some Kendrick Lamar to Nicki Minaj to Eminem. But who knew she was a Young Buck fan?\n\nWhile accepting her Shorty Award for Best Singer earlier this week, Taylor got all T-Swizzle on us.\n\n\"I did not understand what the honor was for,\" she said in a video speech. \"Now, I understand it's because you guys have been unbelievable on social media, and I'm really happy about that. My second thought, just for the record, was 'shorty wanna ride wit me, ride wit me, we can get low!'\"\n\nThat last part is from a hit song in 2004 called \"Shorty Wanna Ride.\" Her little comment about him is actually pretty funny because in an interview with Vibe a few years ago, she talked about passing by the G-Unit rapper's neighborhood back in the day. He's from Nashville, and she moved there as a teenager.\n\n\"I love hip-hop!\" she told the mag. \"The first [song] I memorized was 'Fireman' by Lil Wayne. Ever since then... It's Nicki Minaj, Wiz Khalifa, the Game. When I was in high school, my boyfriend and I would drive around and he'd always point to this neighborhood where Young Buck lived. We would drive by and look at his cars and be like 'Oh my gawwwwwd! Those cars are so coooool! I wonder if he's in there!'\"\n\nBuck caught wind of the shoutout, and tried to gain something out of the moment. He's ready to get in the studio with the pop star.\n\n\"OK @50cent U RIGHT.....I AM #KindOfHotRightNow,\" Buck wrote on Instagram Thursday night. \"SOMEBODY TAG #TaylorSwift AND TELL HER WE OWE #Tennessee A HIT RECORD TOGETHER!!\"\n\n\"LOOKING FOR @taylorswift,\" he wrote in another post. \"SHAWTY WANNA WORK WIT CHA.\"\n\nOh boy...Listen to his song below. Warning though, it's kind of NSFW.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Glamour UK: Taylor Swift Takes Over\n…The radio, the internet, the world, not to mention this issue of GLAMOUR. As she launches her 1989 global tour, Jo Elvin discovers pop’s unstoppable force is also the nicest\n\nWhat happened to Taylor Swift? While we have known, intellectually, for some time that she is the blonde, sweet, multi-platinum-selling country star, we can’t swear that in Britain, we always really got her, can we? In fact, for many years, you’d have sooner flashed your knickers on the bus than let anyone see her name flash up on your iPod.\n\nNow? She is owning us all - a global phenomenon of an album, an obsession to her 25.5million Instagram followers. A Saturday Night Live sketch from a few months ago sums it up nicely, where a bunch of adults rush to their doctors suffering from a new sincere and unironic enjoyment of Taylor Swift tunes. The joke being, this is confusing and alarming for them. I think most of us can relate. Her album 1989 is one of the most ludicrously catchy collections of ‘proper’ pop songs since Gaga’s The Fame. Resistance has been futile. And not only is it now politely tolerated, but actually totally frickin’ cool to unashamedly adore Taylor Swift. Hell, even Kanye, who once famously stormed a stage because she won 'Beyoncé’s’ VMA award, is now a fan.\n\nWe actually, I guess, could be called friends now!“ laughs Taylor, her gazelle-like legs poured into black skinnies and twisting around each other in an armchair. \"I honestly think I needed to continue to prove myself in my career and I think it finally got to a place where he realised he respected what I do as a musician.”\n\nThis is why Taylor Swift will endure. Pretty and sweet, yes, but this 25 year old is no cutie-pie. She is pure guts and steel. For she hasn’t been chasing your, mine or Kanye’s love. She’s stuck to her guns, done her own thing and guess what, we’ve all come running to her. From her days as an 11-year-old Pennsylvanian who would ask her mum every night at bedtime, “Do you think I’ll ever get a record deal?” to the Grammy award-winning pop princess who’s giving me a precious hour before rushing off to be the headline performer at the 2015 Brits, she was always going to fail or succeed at this music thing, 100% her own way. And to think her biggest triumph has come with 1989, the album her record company didn’t even want her to make.\n\n“That was very surprising to me,” she says. “The one thing they had a problem with was me making a pop album. They were very scared that we wouldn’t be able to maintain the level of success we had with Red. But I didn’t care. It would have been all on me if we hadn’t sold half of what they wanted, and I knew that. But I knew that you can’t let fans get comfortable with what you make. We’re supposed to entertain people. Repeating one thing over and over again is not entertaining.”\n\nRefreshing too, is that she has called a resounding 'bullshit’ on the idea that women must be pornographic to sell their music. Pop’s nicest girl was the most successful artist of 2014, with the biggest album release in 12 years, yet, thus far, has had sex with exactly zero wrecking balls. (Side note: Little Miss Balls Of Steel recently shut down two porn domains using her name, by buying them.) \n\n“You know, everybody has different priorities as an artist,” she ventures diplomatically. “Every woman has different things that make them feel strong and powerful. For me, I don’t have any need or urge to write about overt sexuality. It just never occurs to me. I appreciate girls who sing about whatever they want, because that’s what they want to sing about.”\nYou see? Nice. Something that Taylor Swift has, single-handedly, made cool.\n\n“Well, I just don’t place much priority on looking cool,” she shrugs. “And I think at 25, I’m finally OK with feeling that. I’ve said this before. I think there’s this priority on having this persona of being edgy or cool or bored. And those things are all sexy. All those things are chic, when you seem not to care about anything other than yourself. And I just don’t buy into it. I’m really excited by lots of things. I think enthusiasm is the best protection. It can protect you from anything. And I don’t feel bored by any of this, so I don’t strive to look bored by any of this.”\n\nOf course, what she finds deeply boring, to the point of infuriating, is the endless speculation about her love life.  \n\n“Yeah, I do feel jaded about relationships, to be honest,” she says. “I think the media has sent me a really unfair message over the past couple of years, which is that I’m not allowed to date for excitement, or fun, or new experiences or learning lessons. I’m only allowed to date if it’s for a lasting, multiple-year relationship. Otherwise I’m a, quote, 'serial dater’. Or, quote, 'boy crazy’. The narrative has been so wrong, every time it was the same. It’s 'Taylor spotted talking to this guy, she’s chasing him.’ They create a beginning to the story that didn’t happen most of the time, so then they have to create an ending. So they always go to the same fabricated ending that every other tabloid has used in my story, which is, 'She got too clingy’, or 'Taylor has too many emotions, she scared him away’. Which has honestly never been the reason for any of my break-ups. You know what has been the reason? The media. You take something very fragile, like trying to get to know someone, and it feels like walking out into the middle of a gladiator arena with someone you’ve just met. And all of a sudden the public and the media are allowed to say thumbs up or thumbs down. So I just don’t try it any more.”\n\nI really don’t know what to say to this. So I jokingly suggest she tries Tinder.\n\n“What is that?” Ha, the so-called serial dater has never heard of Tinder, let alone swiped either way. When I explain, she rolls her eyes and laughs. “Well, there is no easy way for me to engage with romance. I’m really busy, so I can’t. And it’s a good thing that I feel really independent and I feel that my friends are all I need. It’s kind of a sad way I got there, though, being shamed into it.”\n\nShamed?\n\n“Well, what else is it when you have two boyfriends in one year and everyone’s calling you boy crazy, making jokes about you at awards shows? That’s public humiliation. And I don’t think it’s fair.\"\nAnd, with on-point timing, as we went to press, Taylor’s love life was under the glare again. She’d been seen out with Calvin Harris a few times (she reportedly met him the day after our interview at the Brits). What’s a girl to do? She’s hot. So’s he. And yeah, we’re obsessed. \n\nRead the full interview with Taylor Swift in the June issue of GLAMOUR, out 30 April",

      "Transcript/Content": "Risen Magazine: It doesn’t get bigger than Taylor Swift right now. So what was it like working with her in the early stages of her career?\nTammy Hyler: I keep in touch with her dad and mom and they just gush about her—she has good parents. She was 15 when she signed at Sony, which was where I was writing. She was the new kid in town. I can’t tell you enough good things about her. When I sat with her, she had a melody and half lyrics written, and would just sit with you and ask, “What do you think?” She was that good then! You’re really an editor when you’re writing with Taylor. It literally blew me away. It was no surprise to me when she wrote most of [her album] Speak Now by herself. She’s crossed over to pop so incredibly gracefully that no one has ever really done before. She said to me, “Tammy, I’m going to be a big star. I’m going to have dresses and a rhinestone Taylor guitar that they endorse for me.” And she did.\nI’ve never seen a kid more focused and more streamlined on what she wants. She has the formula for a hook and she keeps growing as an artist. I got to be momma hen and tell her to remember every moment. I told her, “You are going to travel the world and you’re going to wish you had remembered and savored every moment.” She really cares about her fans. She stays behind and signs every autograph and she’ll remember everything about you even five years later. She reminds me a lot of Garth Brooks in that way. I would advise new country stars to always follow what Garth and Taylor do. They did it right.\nTaylor and I wrote a song together—it was a personal song about a friend in her high school that got killed by a drunk driver on prom night. It was one of her favorites, but it didn’t make it to the record because it was so personal and sad. Maybe it will come out at some point. The next record she wrote by herself and now she is writing with the guys who wrote for NSYNC. She’s really the writer and it’s the perfect collaboration.",

Did I win eight awards?\" she asked excitedly. \"Yeah, sick.\"\n\nSwift's video opened with her and Selena Gomez fighting men in an office and then fighting each other. It ended with Swift's and Gomez's armies going head to head. Other stars in the clip included Mariska Hargitay, Ellen Pompeo, Jessica Alba and Ellie Goulding, and Hayley Williams of Paramore.\n\nSwift swapped her first two verses with new ones from rapper Kendrick Lamar for \"Bad Blood,\" a song rumored to be about Swift's friendship with Katy Perry.\n\nSwift's other wins included top female artist and Billboard 200 album for \"1989.\" She sat in the audience with some of her \"Bad Blood\" co-stars as well as rumored boyfriend Calvin Harris. Swift kissed the DJ-producer-singer on the cheek and gave him a hug after winning her awards.\n\n\"I'm happy right now that it all was pulled off without a hitch,\" an excited Swift said in the AP interview about her new video. \"I can't believe it didn't leak. I can't believe the Kendrick version of the song didn't leak. Right now I am just taking the biggest sigh of relief that the fans got to experience it the way I wanted them to experience it, which was a full element of surprise.\"",

NOW WHAT WILL SHE DO FOR AN ENCORE?\n\nTaylor Swift is the quintessential American success story: Armed with little more than a guitar, a boatload of ambition, and an uncanny knack for creating a proliferation of perfect. pop songs, Swift has spent a decade engineering her own perfectly executed rise from that storied Pennsylvania Christmas-tree farm to the covers of magazines like this one. (So many magazines...) The past 12 months mark Swift's best year ever, she says: She became tourism ambassador for her adopted hometown of New York, playfully satirized tabloid perceptions of her, and pivoted from her country roots to debut her first-ever pop album, earning the Billboard Woman of the Year award for the second time and assuming her rightful role among a small circle of intermational superstars Swift breaks album sales records like lesser pop stars break hearts, all while somehow retaining the same wide-eyed charm that made her so likable in the first place.\nShe is also deeply unconcerned with whether or not you consider her attractive, which of course only makes her more so. We spoke with Swift. as she wrapped up the last day of her 1989 four rehearsals, about life on the road, feminism, and what it feels like to be named by Maxim the most talented woman alive. Jessica Roy.\n\nQ: How does it feel being named No. 1?\nA: It's really nice and such an incredible compliment. This year has been my favorite year of my life so far. I got to make an album exactly the way I wanted to make it. I got to put it out exactly the way that I dreamed of putting it out. Every one of these kinds of whims and ideas came to fruition. The videos-I'm proud of those, I'm proud of the tour, I'm proud of the way this has all happened. In the midst of all that, this is really nice. It really feels like a wonderful celebration of my favorite year.\nQ: You're getting ready to go on tour for 1989. What are you doing to prepare?\nA: We've been in rehearsals for months, trying to get the live instrumental versions of these songs. to as close to the album sounds as possible. And also you're lengthening things, creating mash- ups with things. It was fun to play around and get everything sonically right before we got on the actual stage and started doing the choreography. But before all that-probably close to a year ago-we started setting the stage, so that was when the drawing started. Now all\nwe have to do is actually...do the tour.\nQ: Given all that, how do you make time for all your friendships? \nA: It seems like everyone is your best friend. Can I be your best friend? [Laughs) Thankfully, 10 years into my career now, I've learned how to work in a smarter way. You have to have time to breathe and have a happy life, and friendships are so important t to me. Thankfully- thanks to the fans-now we get to play stadiums, so we do two or three stadium shows a week. I'll see my friends in whichever city I'm closer to.\nQ: You've become more vocal about feminism recently. What changed?\nA: Honestly, I didn't have an accurate definition of feminism when I was younger. I didn't quite see all the ways that feminism is vital to growing up in the world we live in. I think that when I used to say, \"Oh, feminism's not really on my radar, it was because when I was just seen as a kid, I wasn't as threatening. I didn't see myself being held back until I was a woman. Or the double standards in headlines, the double standards in the way stories are told, the double standards in the way things are perceived. A man writing about his feelings from a vulnerable place is brave; a woman writing about her feelings from a vulnerable place is oversharing or whining. Misogyny is ingrained in people from the time they are born. So to me, feminism is probably the most important movement that you could embrace, because it's just basically another word for equality.",

      "Transcript/Content": "When I arrive at London’s Savoy hotel on a Friday morning in June, Taylor Swift greets me with a hug before I even properly introduce myself. I compliment Swift on her shimmery, skintight Saint Laurent gown, and she says, beaming, “They usually dress me up like a 12-year-old French boy. It’s nice to be glamorous.”\n\nOver the course of a day spent with Swift, there are moments when it is possible to forget that you’re in the presence of arguably the most famous and influential entertainer on earth, a woman with more than 60 million Twitter followers and 140 million albums sold. I watch as she flips through a playlist on her iPhone to find the song she wants; I listen as she tells her parents that they probably want to head back to their hotel and wait for her there; I nod and smile when she references Monica and Chandler from Friends.\n\nBut then, curled up on a velvet couch in a light-gray faux-fur wrap and cascading hair extensions, she recounts—as plainly as if she were describing a night in, watching Netflix—how she had spent the previous evening: at a dinner party hosted by Stella McCartney at Electric House. As she lists the other attendees—Adele, Kate Hudson, “Sienna,” Ellie Goulding—I remember, as if waking up from a dream (a great one, in which Taylor Swift is your close friend), Oh, right, this is Taylor Swift.\n\nSwift may have the rare ability to make pretty much anyone she meets feel as if they know her intimately, but then she’ll mention Cara or Gigi or Karlie (that’s models Delevingne, Hadid, and Kloss—though if anyone under the age of 25 lives in your household, you already know that), or beckon one of her bodyguards, or casually note her plans to meet Emma Watson at Loulou’s later (“It’s gonna be a feminist rally!”), and you’ll remember that her life is essentially alien to yours, that she can’t walk so much as half a city block without getting mobbed and photographed, that her friends walk Fashion Week runways and appear on the covers of magazines and star in blockbusters.\n\nSwift drops names with regularity, and almost all of them belong to members of her supergroup of B.F.F.’s, many of whom are extremely famous themselves. “My friends and I text every day,” she tells me, looking almost regal in a Saint Laurent smoking suit, sitting at a medieval table in a stately room at the hotel. “That’s 20 to 25 girls … Some of them are group texts, most of them are single texts. We know when everybody’s in New York, who’s in town, who’s in L.A. Being a huge group of girls who love each other, we know where everyone is,” she says, before reflecting, giddily, “I’ve never had this before.” These friends include models (Kloss, Hadid, Delevingne, Kendall Jenner), actresses (Emma Stone, Lena Dunham, Hailee Steinfeld, Jaime King), and musicians (Selena Gomez, Goulding, Lorde, the Haim sisters). Swift lunches and dines with these girlfriends; she attends concerts with them; she crafts with them; she cooks with them; she walks red carpets with them; many of them appear in pre-taped clips that run during her current world-tour stops; and some of them have even emerged, in the flesh, at her shows, to strut down the stage and wave to the crowd. “She shares her stage with people,” Gomez later remarks to me. “A lot of artists would never do that.”\n\nSwift onboarded each member of the tribe in a different manner: Dunham and Swift first connected on Twitter in 2012; Swift met Kloss at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show a year later; most of us became aware of the model Martha Hunt when she started appearing in various Swift dinner-party Instagrams this winter. But the group’s true coronation as a pop-cultural force came this spring, with the blockbuster music video for Swift’s “Bad Blood,” in which more than a dozen members of her posse made cameos. “She was being a boss bitch that day,” Delevingne says of the video shoot, which Swift produced. “She got everyone together. It was just amazing to see her in her element.” Swift, who was 16 years old when her first album, Taylor Swift, was released, has spoken before about her lack of close friends growing up (“I first started writing songs because I didn’t really have anyone else to talk to”), so it’s easy to see her shepherding this squad as an attempt at constructing that high-school experience she never had. Now she doesn’t just have a table to sit at in the cafeteria—she has a dozen tables.\n\nThese girls are not shuffling out of clubs at three A.M. or finding themselves on TMZ for nefarious reasons. Delevingne tells me that a typical night with their cohort involves Swift dressing her friends in “white Victorian nighties,” purchased by Swift at Nashville antique store Gilchrist Gilchrist. Swift has a cupboard of them, Delevingne says, adding, “She’s also great at cooking breakfast.” (“I absolutely slay omelets,” Swift says.) Gomez concurs that their meet-ups are generally low-key: “We go to her house and hang out or cook or we go out to dinner.” Swift is not straitlaced (she says people will sometimes mistakenly assume, upon meeting her, that she “never has a drink and goes to church five times a week”), but she is not exactly a Miley Cyrus either. During lunch, as Swift and I eat salads, someone points out that Swift has a piece of food on her chin, and she announces, “I can never tell when I have food on my face … or when someone’s high. That’s why I can’t go to Coachella or Glastonbury.”\n\nWhile one might think someone at Swift’s level of fame—who can cause a tabloid commotion with a mere frown at an awards show or a slightly unusual choice in post-gym attire—would be cautious about sharing her secrets, Swift says she has proof that her group of friends can be fully trusted. “I do not give an edited version of myself to my friends. [And] anytime I read one of those tabloid articles that says, ‘A source close to Swift says,’ it’s always incorrect. None of my friends are talking, and they know everything.”\n\nWhen I ask if there is ever friction between any members of her diverse clique, Swift shakes her head vigorously. “That doesn’t happen. We even have girls in our group who have dated the same people. It’s almost like the sisterhood has such a higher place on the list of priorities for us. It’s so much more important than some guy that it didn’t work out with. When you’ve got this group of girls who need each other as much as we need each other, in this climate, when it’s so hard for women to be understood and portrayed the right way in the media … now more than ever we need to be good and kind to each other and not judge each other—and just because you have the same taste in men, we don’t hold that against each other.” A few days after our conversation, she posts a picture on her Instagram showcasing a riverboat double date on the Thames, chaperoned by Kloss. In the shot: Swift; Swift’s boyfriend, Scottish D.J. Calvin Harris; Hadid; and Joe Jonas, Hadid’s current boyfriend, who dated Swift in 2008 (and famously dumped her during a 27-second phone call).\n\nSwift has had the kind of 12 months that other pop stars would poison people for. In August of 2014, she released the single “Shake It Off,” which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earned three Grammy nominations. Her fifth album, 1989, arrived two months later, in October, and sold 1.287 million copies in its first week. It went on to become the top-selling album in the U.S. in 2014 and is now the most successful of her career. Swift says this album, her first to feature exclusively pop songs (as opposed to the full-on country and country-tinged pop that made up her first few albums), is the one she “likes the most.” It “feels the most sonically cohesive [of all my albums],” she says. “I couldn’t be more proud of it.”\n\nAt the age of 25, Swift is as wildly popular among tweens as she is among millennials (and baby-boomers, though they may be more reluctant to admit it). She has seven Grammys and 16 American Music Awards; she has been named Billboard’s Woman of the Year twice, in 2011 and 2014; she is a six-time recipient of the Nashville Songwriters Association’s prize for songwriter/artist of the year; and according to Forbes she made $80 million over the past year, with an estimated net worth of $200 million. She also finds time to connect with her fans individually, selecting and wrapping holiday presents for several of them (documented in a six-minute video that has been watched by more than 17 million people), and responding on her blog to the likes of a teenage boy looking for advice on what to wear to prom and a girl who said Swift’s music helped her make it through two heart surgeries.\n\n“I think that her importance is sort of endless,” says Jack Antonoff, who co-wrote three songs on 1989 with Swift and dates Swift Squad member Dunham. “She’s the biggest star, but she’s also making incredible art. It’s a perfect storm.” Gomez notes that Swift is continually ascending to greater heights: “She’s always outdoing herself, [but she remains] who she is at the heart of everything.”\n\nSwift—who appears on the International Best-Dressed List this year for the first time—is now also seen as something of a fashion plate, in part due to her association with this coterie of supermodels. (Swift has performed at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show the past two years.) Her everyday uniform, give or take a beret or kitten heel, typically comprises a crop top, a red lip, and a purse carried out in front of her, hanging from a forearm. Swift herself demurs at the label, though. “I think I know how to put together a good outfit,” she says. “But any day you’re going to admit to being a style icon is a day you need to look in the mirror and really check yourself.” She says she doesn’t talk about fashion with her friends: “We never talk about stuff like that. We’ll be like, ‘Those shoes are cute.’ That’s the full conversation. We all dress very differently.” Delevingne concurs: “There’s always a lot more pressing matters going on than what we’re wearing,” the model tells me.\n\nIf Swift wasn’t already the closest thing we have to a pop-cultural empress, the fallout from the open letter she posted on her blog this June, addressed to Apple, made the great power she wields unquestionably clear. The company had announced that it was going to be launching a new juggernaut streaming service, Apple Music, which would allow users to enjoy a three-month free trial before they would be asked to sign up for a $9.99 monthly subscription. Artists, however, would not be compensated for those three free months, which did not sit right with Swift. She wrote, “I say to Apple with all due respect, it’s not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don’t ask you for free iPhones. Please don’t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.” She posted the letter in the early morning. By the end of the day, Apple had decided to reverse its policy, and Swift was widely heralded as a savior of the music industry. Swift—who had previously withheld 1989 from streaming services such as Spotify (which she does not feel fairly compensates artists for their work)—announced a few days later that she would be letting 1989 stream on Apple Music. Swift told me that, even after Apple’s policy reversal, she was waiting for the indie labels Merlin and Beggars Group to commit to Apple Music before following suit. (As an independent artist herself—Swift owns her own masters and has control of her distribution—she said she wanted to show solidarity with the greater indie community.)\n\n“I wrote the letter at around four A.M.,” she tells me. “The contracts had just gone out to my friends, and one of them sent me a screenshot of one of them. I read the term ‘zero percent compensation to rights holders.’ Sometimes I’ll wake up in the middle of the night and I’ll write a song and I can’t sleep until I finish it, and it was like that with the letter.” I ask if she showed it to anyone before posting it. “I read it to my mom,” she says. “She’s always going to be the one. I just said, ‘I’m really scared of this letter, but I had to write it. I might not post it, but I had to say it.’ ”\n\nSwift says she did not expect Apple to change its thinking; in fact, she was terrified “people would say, ‘Why won’t she shut up about this?,’ ” after the Wall Street Journal op-ed she wrote in July of last year about her concerns regarding free streaming services, such as Spotify. “My fears were that I would be looked at as someone who just whines and rants about this thing that no one else is really ranting about,” she tells me.\n\nAfter Swift pulled all of her music from Spotify in November of 2014, the platform published a blog post about her decision, which read in part: “We hope [Swift] will change her mind and join us in building a new music economy that works for everyone.” The entry ended with a postscript referencing her songs (“Taylor, we were both young when we first saw you … ”). Swift says she was elated to find Apple receptive to her plea, in contrast to how Spotify had responded to her. “Apple treated me like I was a voice of a creative community that they actually cared about,” she says. “And I found it really ironic that the multi-billion-dollar company reacted to criticism with humility, and the start-up with no cash flow reacted to criticism like a corporate machine.”\n\nHas Spotify gotten in touch with or talked to you since you posted your letter?, I ask. “They talk about me a lot,” she says, with a grin reminiscent of one she might flash in a music video while strutting out of an explosion.\n\nWhile Apple’s willingness to engage with Swift on a one-on-one level is in and of itself indicative of her great influence, that the famously secretive and tight-lipped company was willing to chat with me about Swift certainly confirmed it. (One imagines Swift could successfully broker peace treaties between warring nations at this point, if she wanted.)\n\nEddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet software and services, said that Apple had already been discussing paying artists for the trial period, after initial criticism from indie labels, but that Swift’s letter “accelerated [their] thinking.” He told me in a phone interview, “I spent time talking to [Apple C.E.O.] Tim [Cook] about it and giving him my thoughts and, relatively quickly, came to a conclusion of what we thought was the best way to do it.” Cue said that he “didn’t have a problem” with Swift’s calling Apple out (“I appreciated the way she wrote it”), and he said it was important to Apple to treat Swift like a partner in the matter, which is why he made sure to speak to her on the phone before they made any announcements. “When you’re Taylor Swift and you put yourself out there like she did, I thought it was appropriate for us to have a discussion together about it,” he said.\n\nSwift calls Apple’s decision a “huge step forward” for the industry. At the Stella McCartney dinner party mentioned earlier, every woman present individually thanked Swift for writing the missive, she says, either on their own behalf or on behalf of a friend. “I’ve never experienced anything like this before, where everyone in every social situation I’ve been in has heard about this thing that happened.”\n\nBut just when I am starting to think of Swift as near invincible, that trademark self-doubt of hers returns. She slumps in her chair a bit, playing with her white shirtsleeves, and reflects, “I hope it doesn’t turn into something weird, where people have to poke holes in me, which is what’s happened every other time anything good has happened to me. You can’t believe too much of your positive hype, and you can’t believe too much of your negative press—you live somewhere in between.”\n\nFriend in Deed\nToday, Swift says, she feels “very understood” by the public, but she was not always so pleased with the way she was perceived. Around 2013, after public breakups with Harry Styles, Conor Kennedy (the son of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.), and Jake Gyllenhaal, the narrative surrounding Swift was that she was an overly obsessive serial dater, that she only dated guys so she could later write songs about them. Swift decided, eventually, to just stop paying attention to the media. “For the better part of 2012 and 2013, I did not go online, because I didn’t like what they were saying about me,” she says. “And it was so overwhelmingly inaccurate that I knew there was nothing I could do to fight. When the media decides that they don’t like you, there’s nothing you can do that doesn’t seem desperate and irritating to everyone when you try to defend yourself. So I just had to go into my little emotional bunker and pretend there weren’t bombs going off outside.”\n\nSo, how did she crawl out of the bomb shelter? “I think that I just decided if [the media] was going to say that about me, that I was boy-crazy and so dependent on men and all that, I wasn’t going to give them a reason to say that anymore, and I wasn’t going to be seen around any men for years—so that’s what I did,” she says. “And what ended up happening was I became happier than I had ever been before. I swore I would never ever get in another relationship if it meant changing who I was, or taking me out of that mode where my friends are everything to me.”\n\nGomez, 23, who has been best friends with Swift since she was 15, says that she has seen Swift emerge from the tabloid flames, again and again, like a pop-star phoenix. “No matter what sort of tabloid-y thing people are going to try to pin on her, her position, her power, her career, outshines that,” Gomez says. “It’s almost like: Don’t mess with Taylor. Don’t mess with Taylor.”\n\nWhile Swift maintains a “never have, never will” policy when it comes to discussing her dating life, she has been involved with Harris, a D.J. who according to Forbes earned an estimated $66 million last year, since March, when they were seen holding hands at a Kenny Chesney concert in Nashville. (This summer, Harris and Swift have started showing up in each other’s Instagram feeds, the modern-day sign of “things getting serious.”) When I ask how Swift approached dating in light of making this intense commitment to her sisterhood, she explains that she was only going to date someone who wouldn’t infringe on the new life she had carved out for herself. “That was the way that I decided to go on with my life,” she says. “Not looking for anything, not necessarily being open to anything, and only being open to the idea that, if I found someone who would never try to change me, that would be the only person I could fall in love with. Because, you know, I was in love with my life.” (Note the telling past tense in that last sentence, Swifties!)\n\nShe basically lurches out of her seat when asked if it’s important to her that her boyfriend and her friends get along. “SO IMPORTANT. Oh, it’s so important.”\n\n“In every friendship group, you’ve got one or two girls where you hear people say, ‘Oh, she’s so different around her boyfriend!’ ” Swift says. “I never wanted to be that girl. So that was a huge goal of mine: never ever become someone else for the sake of a relationship.”\n\nI suggest that it can sometimes be hard to maintain one’s identity in a new relationship, and Swift laughs, wisely.\n\n“If you’re a people pleaser, like most of us are, you try to adapt to what signals that person is giving off,” she says. “It’s not about changing the fact that you’re a people pleaser; it’s about finding someone [to date] who is not critical. That can be the most painful thing, trying to love someone who is critical in their nature.”\n\nHas that happened to her?, I ask, even though the answer is already obvious.\n\n“Uh, yes,” she says. “But usually I don’t make the same mistake twice. I make new ones, but I don’t usually repeat my old ones.”\n\n\nFamily Gal\nToward the end of lunch, Swift’s parents, Andrea and Scott, arrive. Swift seemed to relax completely in their presence, in the way a college student immediately collapses on her childhood bed full of stuffed animals when returning home for Christmas.\n\nSwift was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, in 1989, and she grew up nearby, on a Christmas-tree farm, which seems too impossibly on-brand to be true, but it is. At age 11, Swift—after watching a Behind the Music special about Faith Hill—decided she needed to be in Nashville if she wanted to give a career in music a real shot, and she asked her mother to take her there so she could submit demos. Eventually, when Taylor was 14, the entire family—including Taylor’s younger brother, Austin—relocated to the Nashville area. (Austin, 23, graduated from the University of Notre Dame this past spring.)\n\n“Mama Swift”—as Swift’s friends refer to Taylor’s mother—attends most of her daughter’s concerts, and it is her job to venture into the crowd every night to choose several of the most passionate of Swift’s fans to meet their idol after the show. When I talk to Andrea, as we sit on a couch backstage a few hours before Swift’s set in Hyde Park, I comment on the near-religious experience these tweens and teens seem to be having as they wait in line to meet Swift. (I overheard one teen shriek, after emerging from meeting Swift, “What did she say to you?” Her friend responded, “I don’t remember!!!”)\n\n“People ask me if my daughter makes me cry,” Andrea says to me. “And I say that it’s when I see other people cry, meeting her, that makes me cry.”\n\nAt the 1989 World Tour stop in Charlotte, North Carolina, Andrea emerged from backstage about 10 minutes before the show was to begin, and I watched as the fans sitting near the stage swarmed her, giving her hugs and asking for selfies. If Taylor Swift is their best friend, Taylor Swift’s mom is their best friend’s mom, the mom whom you feel comfortable confiding in, the parent whose snacks just seem to taste better than the ones your own parents make.\n\nLast April, in a blog post titled “Just so you know … ,” Taylor shared with her fans that Andrea had been diagnosed with cancer. “I’d like to keep the details of her condition and treatment plans private, but she wanted you to know,” Taylor wrote.\n\nWhen I ask Taylor what her strategies are for when she’s feeling really low, completely despondent, about anything in her life, she says that she usually tries to act as her own shrink (“As a songwriter, you end up talking to yourself a lot”). But then she considers the question further. “Or I call my mom. My mom is the last straw. She is the last-ditch effort for me to feel better because she’s really good at being rational and realistic. She’s going to always bring me back to a place where I’m not so imbalanced.”\n\nGossip Swirl\nSince Swift seems so well versed in what is written about her, so aware of the tabloid obsessions and perceived feuds and tailored narratives, and—at this point in her career—so in control of them, I had the sensation, several times, of getting to ask an author why she had taken a certain story line in a particular direction.\n\nSwift recently reconciled with Kanye West, who—in one of the seminal pop-cultural moments so far this century—interrupted Swift (as she was accepting the award for female video of the year) on the stage of the MTV Video Music Awards in 2009, proclaiming that Beyoncé deserved the award. The following year, at the same ceremony, Swift performed a song in which she purported to forgive him, titled “Innocent.” The two then kept their distance from each other for many years, until this past spring, when Swift and West (with wife Kim Kardashian) were seen chatting at the 2015 Grammy Awards; the two are now close enough to have each other’s e-mail address and to go out for dinner together at the Spotted Pig in New York City, developments that would have seemed inconceivable in the aftermath of the incident.\n\n“I feel like I wasn’t ready to be friends with him until I felt like he had some sort of respect for me, and he wasn’t ready to be friends with me until he had some sort of respect for me—so it was the same issue, and we both reached the same place at the same time,” she says. “I became friends with Jay Z, and I think it was important, for Jay Z, for Kanye and I to get along.” She continues, “It started with both of us really liking Jay and wanting him to be happy. And then Kanye and I both reached a place where he would say really nice things about my music and what I’ve accomplished, and I could ask him how his kid’s doing.”\n\nSwift leans forward and smiles coyly when asked if she and West have planned a collaboration, responding she “wouldn’t rule it out.” She assesses, diplomatically, “We haven’t planned anything. But, hey, I like him as a person. And that’s a really good, nice first step, a nice place for us to be.” I tell her that there’s an animated GIF of her and Kardashian, dancing in the audience at the Brit Awards, that I really like, and she immediately knows the one I’m talking about. “I love Kim,” she says. “She’s the sweetest. She’s just a really sweet, kind, warm person.”\n\nSwift’s understanding of the gossip cycle seems so finely tuned at this point that she even knows to get ahead of other potential story lines. She tells me that it really bothered her recently when blogs pitted her star-studded video for “Bad Blood” against Madonna’s for “Bitch I’m Madonna” (which featured Beyoncé, Miley Cyrus, and Katy Perry). “I felt so much resentment that they would take two women who made ambitious music videos and use that as a qualifying factor to comparing and contrasting them. I hated that because Madonna and I have gotten along and been fans of each other and performed together [at the iHeartRadio Awards in March], and I didn’t want to see that, and there was nothing I could do, and there’s nothing she could do, because that’s the way the world works right now.”\n\nAs if to make clear that there is no animosity between them, Swift tells me about the extremely cordial interactions she had with Madonna backstage before the iHeartRadio Awards performance. “She put jewelry on me before we went onstage. When I went into her dressing room, I complimented this candle and this diffuser she had, because her dressing room smelled like a magical woodland forest. A week later, I get this box in the mail, and she had sent me the same diffuser, and all these essential oils, and the exact candle I had complimented.” She concludes, “Madonna and I will collaborate again, and then [the media] will realize there was no weird tension or competitive factor.”\n\nAs for the reported feud between Swift and Katy Perry—Swift’s “Bad Blood” is rumored to be about Perry, who allegedly stole Swift’s touring dancers a few years ago—Swift avoided the topic. But it is hard for me not to think about Perry when Swift lands on the subject of friends she has discarded: “I’ve trusted people before in friendships or relationships and have felt betrayed. I judge people based on their moral code; I think someone is nothing without a moral code. I don’t care if you’re talented or celebrated or successful or rich or popular, if you have no moral code. If you will betray your friend, if you will talk about them badly behind their back, if you will try to humiliate them or talk down to them, I have no interest in having a person like that in my life.”\n\nBackstage Class\nBackstage, before the Hyde Park show, I watch as Swift addresses a group of London industry members who have just awarded her a plaque to commemorate 1989’s success. She’s wearing a stomach-baring white lace crop top, a bright-yellow skirt, and full stage makeup, and her energy level would indicate she had just downed 17 shots of espresso. She thanks the assembled group for playing her music in the U.K., especially initially, when it wasn’t what they were used to playing.\n\nShe individually greets each guest, many of whom have two or three children in tow, and manages to find something to say to all of them that is both authentic and specific (“You guys are one of those lucky families where each parent has a mini-me!”). This Taylor—Businesswoman-Politician-Entertainer Taylor—is a very different Taylor from the one I had gotten to know the day before, the one with whom I had spent about two full minutes trying to remember the word for the conveyance they used in ancient Egypt to carry Cleopatra around. (“Sedan chair” eluded us.)\n\nThe previous day, I had asked her if there’s anyone out there who has a career arc that she could see herself emulating as she gets older. Without missing a beat, she named two women, neither of whom is a musician: Oprah Winfrey and Angelina Jolie. “If you look at Oprah, she’s made so many people happy over the years. She’s made so much money, but she’s given so much of it away,” Swift had told me. “Same thing with Angelina Jolie. She’s been so productive, but she’s used that position to better other people’s lives, and I think that’s where I’d want to be. I want to leave a trail of people behind me who had gotten better opportunities or felt better about themselves because of me or smiled because of me.”\n\nWhile most music-festival backstage areas are either nondescript or semi-gross, when I walk outside Swift’s trailer, it’s as though I’ve arrived at a Milan runway show. Willowy supermodels—Karlie, Gigi, Cara—run around, weaving between barricades, squealing with laughter, like cousins at a Thanksgiving dinner. The sun gleams overhead through the London mist. It would not shock me, given the scene, if the dirt underneath our shoes tasted like honey. (Later, while performing “Style” during the concert, Swift will bring Kloss, Hadid, and Delevingne out onstage, along with Kendall Jenner, Martha Hunt, and Serena Williams.) I think back to our lunch the day before, when Mario Testino asked Taylor how old she was. She had said she was 25, and he’d exclaimed, “So young!”\n\nI walk back inside the trailer, and before the rest of her meet-and-greets are scheduled to start, I am taken over to say hi to Taylor. We hug, and she tells me about the rest of her night after our interview, which she spent with Emma Watson and Cara and the musician St. Vincent, Cara’s girlfriend, at Loulou’s. We talk about the club for a while longer—Swift swinging her hands around as she describes the interior design—and then, instinctively, she looks up at one of the staffers, asks, “Is my general next or is media next?,” and then vanishes behind a curtain to await her first meet-and-greet. Ever so briefly—behind that curtain, for the time it takes the two tweens who are first in line to shimmy through—she is alone.\n\n",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift’s dressing room smells like Madonna. It’s thanks to a scented candle presented by the old queen of pop to the new, after Swift commented on the aroma of Madge’s own chambers. “But hers has a hint of eucalyptus mist, too,” says Taylor. “I don’t have the wherewithal to work a steamer – it seems very complex.”\n\nAs we speak, a display of alien-looking purple flowers arrives from Mary J Blige. Also delivered this morning was a presentation box of M&M’s imprinted with the images of Swift’s two cats. “I am freaking out about them,” she says, zipping across the room. “I sent pictures to all my friends.” She plops back down on the sofa. “So… that’s my dressing room vibe!”\n\nWe’re backstage at the 1989 Tour, the blockbuster arena spectacular in support of Swift’s world-beating album of the same name. This is the fourth of an unprecedented five sold-out nights at LA’s Staples Center, and Swift is loving every minute. “I was thinking about this yesterday and it hit me: I don’t want this tour to end. Ever,” she says. “And that’s never happened to me before.”\n\nPart of the fun of the 1989 Tour is its revolving cast of surprise special guests. Last night, Alanis Morissette joined her to sing angsty 1995 hit ‘You Oughta Know’, and comedian Ellen DeGeneres walked the catwalk dressed as what Swift describes as “a disco ball ballerina”. The guests keep things fresh where nerves no longer do. “I [only] get nervous for TV or any situation in which I feel there are people in the audience who hate me,” she says, hugging her legs to her chest. “If there are a considerable amount of people in the first couple of rows who I know are wishing I would trip and fall onstage, that stresses me out. So not at my shows. Maybe an awards show or something…”\n\nSwift has, as she puts it, “had a lot of very… off the wall things happen” at awards shows, whether going home with so many trophies you feel embarrassed for the other performers or being interrupted on stage at 2009’s MTV VMAs, when Kanye West decided Swift’s Best Female Video nod was an insult to Beyoncé. “I’m one of the few [to have experienced that] – and the other one is in the next dressing room,” she says, gesturing towards the wall. “Did you know Beck’s here?”\n\nSinger-songwriter Beck, target of West’s ire at this year’s Grammys, is tonight’s guest performer. So is this some kind of survivors club? “No, me and Kanye are on such good terms now, six years later,” says Swift. “It took a while… But I had to tell Beck this story earlier. I was at dinner with Kanye a week after the Grammys, he stops what he’s saying and he goes, ‘What is this song? I need to listen to this every day.’ I say, ‘It’s Beck, it’s on an album called ‘Morning Phase’, I think you’ve heard of it…’ We just burst out laughing. And he says, ‘Hey, sometimes I’m wrong.’”\n\nLooming over the weekend, this year’s VMAs pose their own threat, following a back-and-forth with rapper Nicki Minaj. Affronted at not being nominated for her own ‘Anaconda’ video, Minaj tweeted, “If your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated for vid of the year.” Swift took this as a swipe at her own supermodel-tastic ‘Bad Blood’ video and tweeted back, setting in motion a two-day media feeding frenzy in which everyone from Katy Perry (Team Nicki) to Ed Sheeran (Team Taylor) waded in and, at its conclusion, Swift issued an earnest apology to Minaj.\n\nSo that’s going to be awkward, right? Swift exhales deeply. “It’s not any person in particular or any situation that makes me feel nervous about the VMAs, it’s that I don’t know what to be nervous about.” How did she feel when it started blowing up? “I don’t want to talk about it,” she says. “But I send text messages now. If there seems to be some kind of misunderstanding, I go to someone’s management, I get their number and I text them. It’s an important lesson for anyone to learn in 2015.”\n\nTaylor Swift is experiencing a funny kind of fame. Her album ‘1989’ is a cultural milestone, a new generation’s answer to ‘Thriller’. While that album’s mega-success set Michael Jackson on course for a peculiar life, he arguably had an easier ride than Swift. She lives in a world in which her every word, move, outfit and Instagram post is dissected in real time. “I’m in the news every single day for multiple different reasons,” she says. “And it can feel, at times, if you let your anxiety get the better of you, like everybody’s waiting for you to really mess up – and then you’ll be done. A lot of the time I need to call my mom and talk for a really long time, just to remind myself of all the things that are great and all the things that matter. If you do something that defines your character to be not what the public thought you were, that’s the biggest risk.”\n\nThe question is, what do the public think of Taylor Swift? The brilliant, fizzy 2014 single ‘Shake It Off’ spoke of tutting hordes – “They say I stay out too late, go on too many dates” – but Swift is the opposite. The luminous glare of public attention has challenged pop stars to go further and further to shock: weed smoking, body part-flashing – none of it means anything any more. Taylor is the opposite. She has an enviable coterie of high-achieving female friends, among them models, writers, singers and actresses. She dresses immaculately. She doesn’t swear at all in an hour’s conversation. She sells perfection, and that’s the most difficult look to sustain. Miley and Rihanna don’t claim to be role models. Taylor does.\n\n“It’s not about trying to be perfect,” she insists. “Not to try and sound like the good witch in The Wizard Of Oz or something, but I really do want to do good things with what I have, and that’s it. I don’t think my brain could cook up very shocking things for the sake of being shocking.”\n\nRecently, Swift’s been flexing her business muscle, personally taking on first Spotify and then Apple, who she called out for not paying royalties to artists in the trial period of Apple Music. Astonishingly, Apple’s Senior VP Eddy Cue capitulated to Swift’s will the very next day. You’d call it a David & Goliath battle but first you’d have to decide which is which. Swift is the archetypal tall poppy and the shears are already out, from gossip websites questioning the hierarchy of her friend ‘squad’ to a viral video in which comedian Lara Marie Schoenhals plays a bubbly Swift introducing the Salem witches and “the fabulous 51 victims of Bill Cosby” to the stage.\n\nIf there’s a backlash brewing, Swift intends to – well – shake it off. “There’s really nothing I can do about it, because I’m living my life the way I want to live it,” she says. “If you want to be snarky about me sharing my stage with other artists and giving these fans – who’ve paid their own money to see a show – more than they expected to see that night, if you’d like to be snarky about that, then go ahead.”\n\nSwift seems preternaturally well adjusted for a 25-year-old operating under such intense scrutiny, but she’s far from her first flurry of success. Having moved her family from Pennsylvania to Nashville, she signed to RCA Records at 14 and tapped into an under-served market of teenage country music fans. “In 10 years of touring and writing albums, and having my confessional songwriting misunderstood, misconstrued, paraphrased, investigated, I’ve never wavered. This is the way I want to live my life,” she says. Does she ever think about the things she’s lost in her pursuit of a music career? She looks back incredulously. “There’s nothing I would change about my life!” You wouldn’t like to be able to walk down the street unnoticed?\n\n“Nah! I want to play stadiums.” She extends both hands as if weighing the options. “Playing stadiums… walking down the street… I’d choose playing stadiums. It’s a trade-off. There’s no way to travel two roads at once. You pick one. And if you don’t like the road you’re on, you change direction. You don’t sit there and go, ‘Oh, I wish I could have all the good things in the world and none of the bad things.’ It doesn’t work like that.”\n\nIf Swift has a dark side, it doesn’t surface during NME’s eight hours being escorted around the Staples Center. First, she’s goofing around during the soundcheck with Beck and St Vincent, whose guitar playing she enjoys so much she hoots, “I need more of that in my life!” Soon after, Swift is in full uniform – high heels, slip dress and hazard red lips – for the first of many meet-and-greet sessions, which take place in a mini museum containing costumes in glass cases. On the way in, Swift bowls over with an update. “I just heard John Legend is coming tonight so I called Chrissy [Teigen, Legend’s wife] to see if he’d sing ‘All Of Me’ with me,” she says, breathlessly. “He’s going to do it. No rehearsal! No pressure!” She pulls a face of exaggerated, excited worry.\n\nThe show itself is phenomenal. There are killer songs. There are costume changes. There’s a catwalk that rises up and swings around so Swift can serenade each section of the audience. The fans, in turn, show undying devotion.\n\nOne holds up a placard that says ‘Taylor Is Life’. When John Legend does come out, #AllOfMe starts trending on Twitter.\n\nBack in the dressing room, Swift speaks about the challenge of following the stellar ‘1989’. Does the thought scare her? “Nooooooo. How could the next one be as big? Maybe the next album will be a bridge to somewhere else. Or maybe I’ll just go ahead and change everything.” I ask for a hint from the handful of songs she’s written so far and she replies with a scoff. “No! Why would I do that?! God!” The 1989 Tour wraps up in December. After that, Swift says, “I think I should take some time off. I think people might need a break from me. I’m going to… I don’t know. Hang out with my friends. Write new music. Maybe not write new music. I don’t know.” She genuinely looks like she hasn’t really thought about it yet.\n\nThe next night sees more guest stars (Justin Timberlake, gal pal Selena Gomez, Friends’ Lisa Kudrow) and the conclusion of the LA run. That weekend at the VMAs, Swift sings with Nicki Minaj, Minaj turns her attention on Miley Cyrus, Cyrus’ errant nipple dominates headlines and Taylor’s new video is accused of being a “colonialist fantasy” in various thinkpieces. Swift doesn’t comment; dignified silence is often the best response. Her life seems exhausting, like one big chess game. But she’s wired for it. After the show, Taylor’s dad is hanging around. I tell him how much I enjoyed the show. “Sure,” he says, “But who’s having the most fun? Taylor is. As always.” Dad probably knows best.",

      "Transcript/Content": "“That’s a pap,” she says as we leave the restaurant, pointing toward an anonymous gray car that looks like the floor model in an auto dealership specializing in anonymous gray cars. Her security detail suggests that it’s probably not a paparazzo because there’s no way a paparazzo could find us at such an unglamorous, unassuming establishment. But as with seemingly every other inference she has ever made, Taylor Swift is ultimately proven right. The guy in the gray car is taking her picture. This annoys her, but just barely.\n\nIt’s August in Southern California. We crawl into the back of a massive Toyota and start driving to Swift’s West Coast residence, located in a rural enclave of Beverly Hills. The gray car trails us through Franklin Canyon. Swift whips out her phone and starts showing me images from the video shoot for “Wildest Dreams,” including a clip of a giraffe licking her face. She has more photos on her phone than any person I’ve ever met. “I wanted this video to be about the making of a 1950s movie being filmed on location in Africa,” she explains. Swift came up with the concept after reading a book by Ava Gardner and Peter Evans, The Secret Conversations. Her premise for the video (co-starring Clint Eastwood’s son) is that—since social media did not exist in the ’50s—it would be impossible for actors not to fall in love if they were isolated together in Africa, since there would be no one else to talk to.\n\nWe chat a little about Ryan Adams and a little about books. Swift mentions that she wrote a non-autobiographical novel when she was 14, titled A Girl Named Girl, and that her parents still have it. I ask her what it was about, assuming she will laugh. But her memory of the plot is remarkably detailed. (It’s about a mother who wants a son but instead has a girl.) If she released it today, it would immediately be the best-selling YA novel in the nation. When she was about that same age, Swift’s family moved from Pennsylvania to Nashville, to jump-start her music career. I ask what she imagines might have happened if they’d never moved and if she’d never become an artist. “I would still be involved with music in my spare time,” she says. “But I would have gone to college, and I would probably be involved with a form of business where words and ideas are at the forefront. Such as marketing.” She returns to her phone and starts scrolling for an old voice memo she sent to Jack Antonoff of the band Bleachers while they were co-writing songs for 1989. Antonoff’s nickname for Swift is Dead Tooth, a reference to a minor dental mishap. Just as she tells me this, her cell phone rings. The display panel says the incoming call is from J TIMB. “Oh, my God. Justin Timberlake?” Her surprise does not seem artificial. “Can I take this?”\n\nShe takes the call. The volume on her phone is loud enough for me to intermittently hear both sides of the conversation. Swift explains that she’s driving to her house, but that she can’t actually stay there because contractors are renovating almost every room. “Have you ever seen the movie The Money Pit?” asks Timberlake. She has not, so Timberlake provides a capsule review. He has a 4-month-old baby at home and is constantly tired, yet he can’t fall sleep. He asks Swift for advice on sleeping. Swift tells the driver to pull over to the shoulder of the road, since she keeps losing reception as we drive through the canyon. The paparazzo in the gray car casually passes, having not-so-casually followed us for at least five miles.\n\nThe conversation lasts almost 15 minutes (which is a little weird, since I’m just sitting there beside her, openly taking notes). “You’re never going to get old,” Swift assures Timberlake. “That’s scientific fact. That’s medical.” Even her sarcasm is aspirational. Eventually JT tells her the reason he’s calling is because he wants to perform the song “Mirrors” with her on the last night of her upcoming five-date stand at Staples Center. (Late in every concert, Swift brings a surprise guest onstage.) She reacts to this news the way a teenage girl in Nebraska would react if suddenly informed that a paternity test had revealed Taylor Swift was her biological sister.\n\nWhen she ends the call, Swift looks at me and says, “This is so crazy. This is so crazy.” She repeats that phrase four times, each time with ascending volume.\n\nNow, inside my skull, I am thinking one thought: This is not remotely crazy. It actually seems like the opposite of crazy. Why wouldn’t Justin Timberlake want to perform with the biggest entertainer in America, to an audience of 15,000 people who will lose their collective mind the moment he appears? I’d have been much more surprised if he’d called to turn her down. But then I remember that Swift is 25 years old, and that her entire ethos is based on experiencing (and interpreting) how her insane life would feel if she were exactly like the type of person who’d buy a ticket to this particular concert. She has more perspective than I do. Every extension of who she is and how she works is (indeed) “so crazy,” and what’s even crazier is my inability to recognize just how crazy it is.\n\nSo Taylor Swift is right again.\n\nIf you don’t take Swift seriously, you don’t take contemporary music seriously. With the (arguable) exceptions of Kanye West and Beyoncé Knowles, she is the most significant pop artist of the modern age. The scale of her commercial supremacy defies parallel—she’s sold 1 million albums in a week three times, during an era when most major artists are thrilled to move 500,000 albums in a year. If a record as comparatively dominant as 1989 had actually existed in the year 1989, it would have surpassed the sales of Thriller. There is no demographic she does not tap into, which is obviously rare. But what’s even more atypical is how that ubiquity is critically received. Swift gets excellent reviews, particularly from the most significant arbiters of taste. (A 2011 New Yorker piece conceded that Swift’s reviews are “almost uniformly positive.”) She has never gratuitously sexualized her image and seems pathologically averse to controversy. There’s simply no antecedent for this kind of career: a cross-genre, youth-oriented, critically acclaimed colossus based entirely on the intuitive songwriting merits of a single female artist. It’s as if mid-period Garth Brooks was also early Liz Phair, minus the hat and the swearing. As a phenomenon, it’s absolutely new.And this, somewhat predictably, creates a new set of problems.\n\nEven within the most high-minded considerations of Swift’s music, there is inevitably some analysis (or speculation) about her personal life. She’s an utterly credible musician who is consumed as a tabloid personality. Very often (and not without justification), that binary is attributed to ingrained biases against female performers. But it’s more complicated than that. Swift writes about her life so directly that the listener is forced to think about her persona in order to fully appreciate what she’s doing creatively. This is her greatest power: an ability to combine her art and her life so profoundly that both spheres become more interesting to everyone, regardless of their emotional investment in either.\n\nSwift clearly knows this is happening. But she can’t directly admit it, because it’s the kind of thing that only works when it seems accidental. She’s careful how she describes the process, because you don’t become who she is by describing things carelessly.\n\nEven the most serious critics inevitably discuss the more tabloid aspects of your life. Is this valid? Does the fact that you write about yourself in such a confessional style require intelligent people to look at your music through that lens?\nI don’t feel there is any injustice when people expand beyond my music and speculate on who certain songs might be about. I’ve never named names, so I feel like I still have a sense of power over what people say—even if that isn’t true, and even if I don’t have any power over what people say about me. The fact that I’ve never confirmed who those songs are about makes me feel like there is still one card I’m holding. So if you’re going to look at your life and say, “I get to play sold-out football stadiums all over the world. I get to call up my favorite artists and ask them to perform with me, and most of the time they say yes. I get to be on the cover of this magazine”—this is all because I write songs about my own life. So I would feel a little strange complaining about how it’s covered.\n\nBut I’m not asking if it’s fair or unfair, or if the downside is worth the upside. I’m asking from an aesthetic perspective: Is thinking about your real life an essential part of appreciating your music? Could your music be enjoyed the same way in a vacuum, even if no one knew anything else about you?\n“Shake It Off” is one of my most successful songs, and that has nothing directly, intricately, pointedly personal in it. No one really says I stay out too late. I just thought it sounded good.\n\nHave you ever stopped yourself from writing a fictional lyric because you feared it would be incorrectly applied to your nonfictional life?\nNo. Some of the things I write about on a song like “Blank Space” are satire. You take your creative license and create things that are larger than life. You can write things like I get drunk on jealousy but you’ll come back each time you leave, ’cause darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream. That is not my approach to relationships. But is it cool to write the narrative of a girl who’s crazy but seductive but glamorous but nuts but manipulative? That was the character I felt the media had written for me, and for a long time I felt hurt by it. I took it personally. But as time went by, I realized it was kind of hilarious.\n\nIt’s impossible for an artist to control how she is perceived. But an artist can anticipate those perceptions, which is almost as good. “A nuanced sense of humor does not translate on a general scale,” Swift says, “and I knew that going in. I knew some people would hear ‘Blank Space’ and say, See, we were right about her. And at that point, I just figure if you don’t get the joke, you don’t deserve to get the joke.”\n\nThere’s a long tradition of musicians expressing (or pretending to express) a degree of disinterest in how they are metabolized by the culture. They claim to ignore their own reviews while feigning a lack of discernment about what their audience wants or expects, since these are things that cannot be manipulated. Swift is not like this. She has an extrinsic focus that informs her creative process. From her perspective, not tracking how people view your work feels stranger than the alternative.\n\n“I went through a few years where I just never went online and never looked at blogs,” she recalls. “This was around 2013, when the only thing anyone wanted to write about me was about me and some guy. It was really damaging. You’re thinking, ‘Everybody goes on dates when they’re 22. It’s fine, right?’ Nope. Not when you’re in this situation, and everything you do is blown out of proportion and expanded upon. And all of a sudden, there’s an overriding opinion that doesn’t accurately reflect how you actually live your life. So I didn’t go online for a year and a half. I actually forgot my Instagram password. But now I check in and see what’s happening. In 2015, that stuff does matter. Because if enough people say the same thing about me, it becomes fact in the general public’s mind. So I monitor what people say about me, and if I see a theme, I know what that means. I’ve had it happen twice before. In 2010, it was She’s too young to get all these awards. Look how annoying she is when she wins. Is she even good? And then in 2013, it was She just writes songs about guys to get revenge. She’s boy-crazy. She’s a problematic person. It will probably be something else again this year.”\n\nHow you view this level of consciousness is proportional to how you feel about Swift as a public figure. There is a perpetual sense that nothing about her career is accidental and that nothing about her life is unmediated. These are not unusual thoughts to have about young mainstream stars. But what’s different with Swift is her autonomy. There is no Svengali directing her career; there is no stage mother pushing her toward the spotlight. She is in total control of her own constructed reality. If there was a machine that built humans out of positive millennial stereotypes, Swift would be its utopian creation.\n\n“I used to watch Behind the Music every day,” she says. (Her favorite episode was the one about the Bangles.) “When other kids were watching normal shows, I’d watch Behind the Music. And I would see these bands that were doing so well, and I’d wonder what went wrong. I thought about this a lot. And what I established in my brain was that a lack of self-awareness was always the downfall. That was always the catalyst for the loss of relevance and the loss of ambition and the loss of great art. So self-awareness has been such a huge part of what I try to achieve on a daily basis. It’s less about reputation management and strategy and vanity than it is about trying to desperately preserve self-awareness, since that seems to be the first thing to go out the door when people find success.”\n\nMost Popular\nThe Real-Life Diet of Longevity Expert David Sinclair, Who Says Even One Glass of Wine Can Hold You Back\nThe Real-Life Diet of Longevity Expert David Sinclair, Who Says Even One Glass of Wine Can Hold You Back \nBy Brittany Loggins\n\nTim Robinson Broke My Boyfriend's Brain\nTim Robinson Broke My Boyfriend's Brain\nBy Chloe Hall\n\nEverything You Need to Know About the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale 2023\nEverything You Need to Know About the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale 2023\nBy The Editors of GQ\n\nThe advantage of this self-focused fixation is clear. Swift is allowed to make whatever record she wants, based on the reasonable argument that she understands her specific space in the culture more deeply than anyone around her. The making of 1989 is a prime example: She claims everyone at her label (the Nashville-based Big Machine) tried to persuade her not to make a straightforward pop album. She recounts a litany of arguments with various label executives over every possible detail, from how much of her face would appear on the cover to how co-writer Max Martin would be credited in the liner notes.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Swift won every one of these debates.\n\n“Even calling this record 1989 was a risk,” she says. “I had so many intense conversations where my label really tried to step in. I could tell they’d all gotten together and decided, ‘We gotta talk some sense into her. She’s had an established, astronomically successful career in country music. To shake that up would be the biggest mistake she ever makes.’ But to me, the safest thing I could do was take the biggest risk. I know how to write a song. I’m not confident about a lot of other aspects of my life, but I know how to write a song. I’d read a review of [2012’s] Red that said it wasn’t sonically cohesive. So that was what I wanted on 1989: an umbrella that would go over all of these songs, so that they all belonged on the same album. But then I’d go into the label office, and they were like, ‘Can we talk about putting a fiddle and a steel-guitar solo on ‘Shake It Off’ to service country radio?’ I was trying to make the most honest record I could possibly make, and they were kind of asking me to be a little disingenuous about it: ‘Let’s capitalize on both markets.’ No, let’s not. Let’s choose a lane.”\n\nLike almost all famous people, Swift has two ways of speaking. The first is the way she talks when she’s actively shaping the interview—optimistic, animated, and seemingly rehearsed (even when that’s impossible). The second is the way she talks when she cares less about the way the words are presented and more about the message itself (chin slightly down, brow slightly furrowed, timbre slightly deeper). The first way is how she talks when she’s on television; the second is unequivocal and less animatronic. But she oscillates between the two styles fluidly, because either (a) this dissonance is less intentional than it appears or (b) she can tell I’m considerably more interested in anything delivered in the second style.\n\nLate in our lunch, I mention something that happened several years ago: By chance, I’d found myself having dinner with a former acquaintance of Swift’s who offhandedly described her as “calculating.” This is the only moment during our interview when Swift appears remotely flustered. She really, really hates the word calculating. She despises how it has become tethered to her iconography and believes the person I met has been the singular voice regurgitating this categorization. As she explains these things, her speech does not oscillate from the second mode.\n\n“Am I shooting from the hip?” she asks rhetorically. “Would any of this have happened if I was? In that sense, I do think about things before they happen. But here was someone taking a positive thing—the fact that I think about things and that I care about my work—and trying to make that into an insinuation about my personal life. Highly offensive. You can be accidentally successful for three or four years. Accidents happen. But careers take hard work.”\n\nHere we see Swift’s circuitous dilemma: Any attempt to appear less calculating scans as even more calculated. Because Swift’s professional career has unspooled with such precision, it’s assumed that her social life is no less premeditated. This even applies to casual, non-romantic relationships. Over the past three years, Swift has built a volunteer army of high-profile friends, many of whom appear in her videos and serve as special guests at her concerts. In almost any other circumstance, this would be seen as a likable trait; Leonardo DiCaprio behaved similarly in the ’90s, and everyone thought it was awesome. But it’s somehow different when the hub of the wheel is Swift. People get skeptical. Her famous friends are marginalized as acquisitions, selected to occupy specific roles, almost like members of the Justice League (“the ectomorph model,” “the inventive indie artist,” “the informed third-wave feminist,” etc.). Such perceptions perplex Swift, who is genuinely obsessed with these attachments. “I honestly think my lack of female friendships in high school and middle school is why my female friendships are so important now,” she says. “Because I always wanted them. It was just hard for me to have friends.”\n\nPopular people often claim they were once unpopular, so I ask Swift for a specific example. She tells a story about middle school, when she called several of her peers on the phone and asked if they wanted to go shopping. Every girl had a different excuse for why she couldn’t go. Eventually, Swift’s mother agreed to take her to the local mall. When they arrived, Swift saw all of the girls she had called on the phone, goofing around in Victoria’s Secret. “I just remember my mom looking at me and saying, We’re going to King of Prussia Mall. Which is the big, big mall in Pennsylvania, 45 minutes away. So we left and went to the better mall. My mom let me escape from certain things that were too painful to deal with. And we talked about it the whole ride there, and we had a good time shopping.”\n\nThis incident appears to be the genesis for a verse in her 2008 song “The Best Day,” a connection she doesn’t note when she tells me the story. A cynical person could read something into this anecdote and turn it into a metaphor about capitalism or parenting or creativity or Pennsylvania. But in the framework of our conversation, it did not seem metaphoric of anything. It just seemed like a (very real) memory that might be more internally motivating than any simplistic desire for money or power.\n\nSo is it unfair to categorize Swift as calculating? Maybe, and particularly if you view that term as exclusively pejorative. But calling her guileless would be even crazier. Swift views her lyrics as the most important part of her art (“The lyrics are what I want you to focus on,” she asserts), so we spend some time parsing specific passages from specific songs. Here is how she dissects the conjecture over “Bad Blood,” a single universally assumed to be about Katy Perry.\n\nYou never say who your songs are about, but you concede that if enough people believe something, it essentially becomes fact. So by not saying who you’re writing about, aren’t you allowing public consensus to dictate the meaning of your work? If everyone assumes that “Bad Blood” is about a specific person, aren’t you allowing the culture to create a fact about your life?\nYou’re in a Rolling Stone interview, and the writer says, “Who is that song about? That sounds like a really intense moment from your life.” And you sit there, and you know you’re on good terms with your ex-boyfriend, and you don’t want him—or his family—to think you’re firing shots at him. So you say, “That was about losing a friend.” And that’s basically all you say. But then people cryptically tweet about what you meant. I never said anything that would point a finger in the specific direction of one specific person, and I can sleep at night knowing that. I knew the song would be assigned to a person, and the easiest mark was someone who I didn’t want to be labeled with this song. It was not a song about heartbreak. It was about the loss of friendship.\n\nBut nobody thinks that song is about a guy.\nBut they would have. So I don’t necessarily care who people think it’s about. I just needed to divert them away from the easiest target. Listen to the song. It doesn’t point to any one person or any one situation. But if you’d listened to my previous four albums, you would think this was about a guy who broke my heart. And nothing could be further from the truth. It was important to show that losing friendships can be just as damaging to a person as losing a romantic relationship.\n\nNow, there are more than a few molecules of bullshit in this response. When Swift says, “And that’s basically all you say,” she’s neglecting to mention that she also told the reporter that the disharmony stemmed from a business conflict, and that the individual in question tried to sabotage an arena tour by hiring away some of her employees. These details dramatically reduce the pool of potential candidates. Yet consider the strategy’s larger brilliance: In order to abort the possibility of a rumor she did not want, she propagated the existence of a different rumor that offered the added value of making the song more interesting.\n\nSwift can manufacture the kind of mythology that used to happen to Carly Simon by accident.\n\nSpeaking of accidents, here’s some breaking news: They happen to Taylor Swift, too. She believes the most consequential accident of her professional life was when Kanye West famously stormed the stage during her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. I’m surprised when she brings this up unprompted, because she has barely addressed the incident in five years, aside from the (comically undisguised) song “Innocent.” But fences have been mended and feelings have been felt. At this summer’s VMAs, Swift warmly presented West with the Video Vanguard trophy. She’ll probably serve as Secretary of the Interior when he becomes president.\n\nSwift was lauded for handling West’s ’09 intrusion with grace and composure, but her personal memories of the event dwell on the bewilderment. When West first jumped onstage, Swift halfway assumed he was about to make a special presentation, honoring her for being the first country artist to ever win a VMA. She truly had no idea what was transpiring. “When the crowd started booing, I thought they were booing because they also believed I didn’t deserve the award. That’s where the hurt came from. I went backstage and cried, and then I had to stop crying and perform five minutes later. I just told myself I had to perform, and I tried to convince myself that maybe this wasn’t that big of a deal. But that was the most happenstance thing to ever happen in my career. And to now be in a place where Kanye and I respect each other—that’s one of my favorite things that has happened in my career.”\n\nSwift analyzes her friendships so often that I eventually ask what seems like an obvious question: Does she ever feel lonely? She responds by literally talking about Friends. “I’m around people so much,” she says. “Massive amounts of people. I do a meet-and-greet every night on the tour, and it’s 150 people. Before that, it’s a radio meet-and-greet with 40 people. After the show, it’s 30 or 40 more people. So then when I go home and turn on the TV, and I’ve got Monica and Chandler and Ross and Rachel and Phoebe and Joey on a Friends marathon, I don’t feel lonely. I’ve just been onstage for two hours, talking to 60,000 people about my feelings. That’s so much social stimulation. When I get home, there is not one part of me that wishes I was around other people.”\n\nThis is understandable. Still, I note something any musician obsessed with self-awareness would undoubtedly recognize: In the retrospective context of a hypothetical Behind the Music episode, this anecdote would be framed as depressing. It would paint the portrait of a super-famous entertainer spending her day emoting to thousands of strangers, only to return home to an empty house and the one-way company of two-dimensional characters.\n\nDoes she not see the irony?\n\nOh, she sees it. But that doesn’t mean it’s real.\n\n“There is such a thing as having enough,” she says in her non-TV voice. “You might think a meet-and-greet with 150 people sounds sad, because maybe you think I’m forced to do it. But you would be surprised. A meaningful conversation doesn’t mean that conversation has to last an hour. A meet-and-greet might sound weird to someone who’s never done one, but after ten years, you learn to appreciate happiness when it happens, and that happiness is rare and fleeting, and that you’re not entitled to it. You know, during the first few years of your career, the only thing anyone says to you is ‘Enjoy this. Just enjoy this.’ That’s all they ever tell you. And I finally know how to do that.”\n\nTaylor Swift is 25. But she’s older than you.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Ryan Adams Talks ‘Vibey’ Unreleased Demos Cut With Taylor Swift & His ‘1989’ Cover Album\n\nIn its first week in stores, Taylor Swift’s 1989 sold 1.287 million copies. One of those albums was snagged by Ryan Adams, a Swift supporter who’d already praised the “pure alchemy” of working in the studio with “one of the most fucking amazing writers” he’d ever seen. \n\n“I started thinking, you know what? When Christmas rolls around, I’m going to try to record my own version,” Adams says, thinking back to last fall. His earliest plan was to record a “totally reverbed out” version on a 4-track recorder in the style of Bruce Springsteen’s Nebraska, but the analog gods wouldn’t allow it. “I basically forgot the first rule of thumb with 4-tracking and that’s only record two or three songs per cassette because the tape gets really worn out… I got to, like, the fourth song… the tape machine ate the cassette tape and went into the machine, messed up the machine, and totally messed up the tape.” \nThe project was revitalized when Adams completed some 2015 tour dates, and took up guitarist Todd Wisenbacker on a standing offer to hit the studio when they were both free. Adams met Wisenbacker when he was producing the indie pop band La Sera in Pax-Am’s L.A. studio, and the two quickly bonded over a love of Johnny Marr’s guitar work. \n\n“I was like, this is a perfect opportunity for me to do this now,” Adams says, playing off the post-tour adrenaline that hit him every night around 10 p.m., even if there was no stage to take. “I’d already been singing my own songs for a year and I’d already recorded the follow-up record for my last record, which is a two-part record, so that’s like 23 songs of my own stuff. I was basically pretty tired of singing and playing my own stuff, but I wanted to make music.” \n\nAdams and Wisenbacker — along with bassist Charlie Stavish and drummer Nate Lotz — set out to take on 1989 as “a cross between (Springsteen’s) Darkness on the Edge of Town and (the Smiths’) Meat Is Murder.” “Along the way, Taylor was excited and I would send her little updates. On the last day, I sent it through the link. I was like, here you go, and I really kind of let it go after that.”\n\nRyan-Adams-1989-album-cover-_2015-billboard-650x650\nCourtesy Photo\nAdams and Swift weren’t new friends. Swift has long cited his influence on her songwriting, and the pair hit the studio for some sessions prior to her 2012 album, Red. \n\n“Right away, we sit down with guitars and she has this incredible riff, like really simple but totally effective, with this unbelievable, rolling harmonic line. It was clear to my right then why this artist is basically a solar star. I think some people are able to remain completely personal but able to create something at the same time that’s as vulnerable as any song can be.” \n\nTaylor Swift (And Her Cat!) Are Counting Down to Ryan Adams’ ‘1989’ Cover Album\n\nThose sessions were never released, but Adams reflects fondly on that batch of songs. “We cut a pretty cool, uncomplicated demo that sounded pretty vibey. It sounded like she was rolling her way to a pretty full, great record by then.” \n\n\n\n\nIn covering 1989, it’s clear Swift’s work touched Adams profoundly. “I certainly felt everything as though it were my own experience.” Adams was once a Manhattanite, and his 2001 single “New York, New York” was perhaps his biggest hit, but what memories bounced around his head while he sung “Welcome to New York”? “I think if I were to be specific, it would probably take away things for the listener.” Some you can actually hear. \n\nOn the chorus of “Style,” Adams nixes Swift’s “James Dean daydream look in your eye” for “Daydream Nation look in your eye,” nodding to a very different sort of classic that came out of New York City one year before 1989. “In the moment I wanted to think about someone in particular, just for that brief moment, to change a moment, to just change one color of the lyrics.” \n\nRead Billboard’s Review of Ryan Adams’ 2015 Governors Ball Set\n\nBut the vas majority of 1989’s lyrics remained unchanged, even if it meant Adams entering Swift’s vernacular of haters and “mad love.” Adams own interpretations — sometimes drastically different than their Max Martin and Shellback-produced counterparts — were personal enough. \n\n“Where it might have been hopeful before, it might sound more filled with regret, like ‘How You Get the Girl.’ Or like ‘Shake It Off,’ like the way I read the lyrics out loud to myself, I was compelled to side more with the anxiety and the pressure of a feeling like you are the subject matter of people’s conversations that maybe aren’t in the best light. I liked the pressure of that and wanted the music to sound like it was running away from that… That’s a feeling and a place and a time that was inside the movie of my mind — what the parallel universe of my 1989 could be.” ",

      "Transcript/Content": "What does it mean to be a Taylor Swift fan? A few years ago, it was cool to like Swift, ironically, that is; to sheepishly divulge you actually enjoyed You Belong With Me, an admission that would require an eye roll and a faux-groan of some sort. You have probably sung one of her songs at karaoke before. YBWM’s music video was a miniature teen movie, with Swift playing two trope characters: the popular cheerleader and the nerd next door who pines after the boy. Perfect bait for rose-tinted-bespectacled teenagers and pre-teens. (Before you consider my judgement too harsh, it may be time for me to confess: I have all her albums. No shade here.) Liking Swift back then was like a double negative, proving that you were indeed so cool, secure and confident in your own right that you were open about liking a blonde American singer who sang country songs for teenagers. When Swift heard Lena Dunham professed a love of her music, even she was sceptical that the indie-cool Brooklyn-resident producer and director was genuinely a fan of her music, unironically. \n\n\nNowadays the tide has turned. This is sure to go down in musical history as a landmark year for Swift. She has won a multitude of awards, broken records, taken on Apple to fight for the rights of musicians and withdrawn her music from Spotify because of its approach to intellectual property. She confirmed her first serious romantic relationship, with the DJ Calvin Harris (their combined net worth trumps Jay-Z and Beyoncé’s), though after initially withstanding questions about her dating life, she now bristles at them and refuses to speak about it. It’s been a gradual change in image, too, seeing her shrug off the twee spangly princess dresses and ringlets for Mary Katrantzou playsuits and Oscar de la Renta gowns. \n\n\nMost noticeable is her self-branding as a new wave of girl power not seen since the dubiously scented Spice Girls’ version in the 90s, banding together with other ambitious women. These women range from Dunham, to actors Hailee Steinfeld and Emma Stone, to the new breed of “Insta-models”: Gigi Hadid, Karlie Kloss and Cara Delevingne. “My friendship group is one of my favourite things about my life right now,” she explains over the phone during a break from her tour. “Our friends really have each others’ back. It’s the first time in my life that I’ve had anything strong like that in the friendship department.” \n\n\nSquad goals: a guide to Taylor Swift's clique\n\n\nWhile many are old friends – she has known Selena Gomez and Lily Aldridge since she was a teenager – she is also active in pursuing new friendship, telling stories of how she began friendships with Serayah and Zendaya. “A lot of the time I’ll reach out to people to tell them they’re great and a friendship will come out of them. Ella and I – Lorde – we met on our own because her album came out and I sent her flowers and told her it was great and now she’s one of my best friends. Friendship often comes from admiration and that feels like a natural way to be friends with someone because you’ve established you respect what the person does.”\n\n\nHer dedication to her fellow female friends – dubbed her #girlsquad – has even helped usher the word “squad” into contemporary vernacular, working conveniently as either its own entity or as both a suffix or prefix, something that surely makes self-confessed grammar fan Swift beam a little more brightly with pride. Try, for example, #squadgoals or #glamsquad. It’s cool to be a Swift fan today. \n\n\nWhile to us it seems like a good time to be Taylor, she disagrees immediately. “Oh, that is such an illusion,” Swift says drily. “The public could change their minds about me tomorrow. If they decided that I was annoying tomorrow, they would use that angle and then a few other writers would use that and it would catch on,” she says, knowing how the media works. “Things are good right now but I’m never going to be stupid, foolish or ignorant enough to think I have control over the public. All I can control is making good music. I am so lucky that people seem to like me right now, but in no way, shape or form is it a permanent thing. And I think being aware of that is what keeps you smart and is what keeps you on the game.”\n\n\nEvery two years since 2006 she has released an album, followed by a tour, then moved onto the next one. But her latest album, 1989, might change plans a bit. “This album has produced more number ones than any album in the past, so we’re just going to go with it,” she says, going on to explain how the usual album cycle could be extended. “Then I’ll feel like I’ll need to give people a breather from me because at a certain point they’re going to get  a little sick of hearing about me, so I’ll need to go away for a while then, depending on my gauge on how sick of me they are, I’ll decide when to put out the next album.” \n\n\n1989 isn’t so much a twentysomething tell-all than a musical reflection from a very heightened self-awareness of not only her own emotions, but also of public perceptions. “I’ve been learning every single day what the right amount of sharing [of her personal life] is, and lately it’s been not natural because this album is such a snapshot of my life – it was so vivid, direct and honest.” The songs address dating rumours, like in Blank Space, and naysayers – “Got nothing in my brain, that’s what people say”, she throws back in the poptastically hypnotic Shake It Off. “One of my main goals is to trying to preserve my sense of reality,” she says of her career. \n\n\nHow I got there: Taylor Swift's seven tips on career success\n\n\nHer favourite television show while growing up was VH1’s Behind the Music, which profiled famous music groups and singers. “There was always this part of the show where they would show the decline and the moment where everything would fall apart, and I would expect it, even as a kid. It would always seem like the decline of an artist was attributed to a combination of things, but I noticed that the top elements were  a loss of self-awareness and making bad art, and usually one led  to the other,” she analyses. “That loss of self-awareness can be so dangerous, so that’s when I have days when I have healthy self-esteem and things are in a great place, and I have days where  self-doubt is my primary emotion, and that’s okay, because that means you’re living a human, emotional, unaffected life.” \n\n\nLike many high achievers Swift is hard on herself, but she’s refreshingly unfiltered and articulate about it. “When I think I haven’t done the right thing, haven’t done a good enough job,  I will punish myself emotionally for it over and over again, going over it in my head,” she continues. “I always have to work on being easier on myself, because over-thinking is my greatest adversary when it comes to life, work, love, friendship, career. I’ve been a bit better lately and realising when I’m having a low-self-esteem day that’s because of how I’m wired, not because everybody hates me,” she says, laughing at herself. \n\n\nSwift will be finishing up her tour in Australia just before her 26th birthday in December. Her stadium concerts consistently sell out, so she doesn’t get nervous on stage anymore (“If people bought tickets to see me, then they don’t necessarily want me to do badly,” she reasons) but admits instead: “If I’m being honest, at some awards shows, because if the energy out there is really competitive, I know exactly what people, who are my competition, how they might hear me and it’s a really stressful environment when you’re on stage. You feel like, maybe some people in the first few rows wish you would trip and fall, and then it would become a viral video. That’s a pretty stressful and hectic situation to put yourself in, but it’s my job so I deal with nerves and just do it and hope for the best.” \n\n\nOn her past tours special guests would be other artists whose hometown she was performing in, or who were touring at the same time. “But I figured, if I kept on doing the same thing, people would then expect who I was going to bring out, so I wanted to really amp up the element of surprise.” This tour has included everyone from Serena Williams, Julia Roberts and Joan Baez to Justin Timberlake and John Legend and up-and-coming artists, which additionally proves her pulling power and clout. “I’ll approach them and say: ‘I’ll fly you to a city on the tour, I’ll fly you there and back,’” she says, aware of the difficulty of surprising fans in 2015 (she describes how sound checks are done without speakers switched on, since fans are outside trying to guess who the surprise guest is). “Part of being an entertainer is to try and show people something that’s going to confuse them, delight them, surprise them.” \n\n\nWin a VIP double pass to the Taylor Swift 'The 1989 World Tour' concert\n\n\nAnother surprise of sorts was when she pivoted musically to embrace pop for her latest album, rather than going for her usual country. “You can take that in two different directions: you can take it in the direction of shock, or you can take it in the direction of surprise. I choose surprise every time because I would so much rather plan an elaborate surprise that’s going to delight them rather than trying to shock.” She’s thoughtful about what she wants to elicit from her fans. “Where shock value is your only trick, it’s harder to maintain a long career. I can keep surprising them, which is a big deal for me to capture that emotion because it’s so rare these days.” \n\n\nThere’s a lyrical quality to how she puts words together. Her favourite writer is F. Scott Fitzgerald, for the “beauty and eloquence of his language itself. His writing is more poet and songwriter in nature than novelist.” And, of course, we know that it’s there in her songs, where she inserts poetic conceits (“I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream”, as she taunts in Blank Space). It’s there in how she speaks, too: the cadences in her sentences, the unlearnable consciousness of rhyme, rhythm and repetition. But it’s undercut by a voice that’s lower in pitch and more serious in tone than her songs may suggest, though with just enough of that queen bee bite to it, an ideal accompaniment to those masterful turns of phrase in her song lyrics. “Being a songwriter is the reason why I approached all of this with such conviction. I don’t think that I would care 1/16th as much if I didn’t write every song lyric that you hear me sing,” she says, the words gushing out over the phone. “It drives everything, it drives creative ideas about what the music videos are going to be, it drives the production elements that are going to be on tour and the stories I want to tell. It absolutely determines everything; everything’s drawn from the lyrics.” \n\n\nIt was her writing abilities that ignited her musical career. She won a national poetry competition in primary school, and was the youngest ever songwriter to be hired by Sony, at the age of 13. Catchy songs aside, the way she communicates to her fans allows them intimate access through coded line notes and a social media account full of visual and literary witticisms about herself, internet memes and other in-the-know subjects. “Social media can be such an amazing tool to talk to fans. I go on Tumblr to read someone’s having a bad day and I’ll send them a message to try and cheer them up, or I’ll comment on a video of a little kid dancing to my song,” she says. “Another way is that I have friends who are models but are also loved by my fans because they have personality, which they can show fans on social media. Gigi [Hadid] and Kendall [Jenner] are really great at it and Cara [Delevingne] is amazing … [the fans] feel that they know these girls because they are so open about their lives and I think that element is great in my career too. People can go onto my Instagram and see weird videos of my cat as well as behind-the-scenes of the Bad Blood video. I like it to be a mix.” \n\n\nShe’s pinpointed this talent within herself. “I love being around people. It’s not something I can control; it’s like a genetic part of my personality that I was born with,” she explains. “What you don’t realise when getting into music is that a huge part of your job, your career and your industry is meeting people you’ve never met before, and having short conversations that have to be meaningful even though they’re short.” A fruitful career in any artistic pursuit is a mixture of talent, luck and perseverance, so Swift may well have highlighted another factor for the 21st century expected of celebrities: access for all. “My greatest strength is not disliking new people or being around people, even if I don’t know them.”\n\n\nSee Taylor Swift's red carpet evolution\n\n\nThe road to pop music stardom is fraught with obstacles. Swift, of all people, knows this best. She lists the biggest misconceptions about her: “From 2012 it’s like: ‘Oh, she’s boy crazy!’ – I’m chasing this boy, or I’m desperate – and then the ones from 2010: ‘Too much too soon, is she even talented?’” Or, the ones from more recently: “You know, like: ‘Her friendship clique is just one group of mean girls!’ There’s too many to pick from so they drown each other out. There’s too many to pick a favourite,” she says in one breath, reeling off the list with startling timeline accuracy. \n\n\nCasting an eye over her past two years, she acknowledges she’s changed personally. “I look back on that person I was and think of how I had such a different life, different priorities, different opinions on things.” For a more final iteration of her career, she’s lightly entertaining the idea of remaining in the music industry but behind the scenes. “If I were to say: ‘Okay, what am I going to be doing when I hit 40?’ I have no way of knowing but I hope I would still have music in my life,” she says as a caveat. \n\n\n“But if I were to give you my best guess I’d say I’ll write songs for other people, or I’ll create an album that’s about what I’m going through at that point in my life. We’re people-pleasers, that’s why we became entertainers, so if people don’t want you to be on stage anymore in sparkly dresses singing songs to teenagers when I’m 40, then I’m just not going to do it. It’s just a goal of mine to not try and be something I’m not.” Her next surprise? Coming to us in three, two, one …",

      "Transcript/Content": "It can take a village to create an album, and in the case of Taylor Swift’s 1989, an international village.\n\nFrom Sweden to New York City to London to Nashville and beyond, 1989 represents a true team effort. Quarterbacking the team was Swift, a self-assured artist who envisioned the unabashed pop project after awakening in the middle of the night with sudden clarity. With select collaborators such as Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, and Jack Antonoff onboard, Swift carried out her singular vision of making a “sonically cohesive record.”\n\n1989 proved to be not only cohesive, but another career milestone for Swift. The chart-topping album sold more than 1.2 million copies in its first week and netted the seven-time GRAMMY winner seven total 58th GRAMMY nominations.\n\nFollowing, Swift and other key players behind her pop triumph share their inside story of 1989.\n\nTaylor Swift (artist/co-producer): I woke up [one morning] at 4 a.m. and I [decided the album is] called 1989. I’ve been making ‘80s synth pop, I’m just gonna do that. I’m calling it a pop record. I’m not listening to anyone at my label. I’m starting tomorrow.\n\nI liked the idea of collaborating. But with 1989 I decided to narrow down the list. It wasn’t going to be 10 producers, it was going to be a very small team of four or five people I always wanted to work with, or loved working with. And Max [Martin] and I were going to oversee it, and we were going to make a sonically cohesive record again.\n\nImogen Heap (co-producer/co-engineer): We met at my studio in London. She had the bare bones of “Clean.” She had the lyric, the chorus and the chords. I thought it was brilliant.\n\nSwift: I had this metaphor in my head about being in this house, there’s been a drought but you feel like there’s a storm coming. Instead of trying to block out the storm you punch a hole in the roof and just let all the rain come in, and when you wake up in the morning, it’s washed away.\n\nHeap: I was really writing the tiniest amount just to help her do what she does. I put some noises to [“Clean”], played various instruments on it, including drums, and anytime she expressed she liked something I was doing, I did it more. It was a really fun day.\n\nShe recorded all her vocals [for “Clean”] during that one session. She did two takes, and the second take was it. We always thought she would probably re-record it, because we thought it can’t possibly be that easy. But after we lived with it for a few months, we felt it was great.\n\nSwift: The coolest thing about Imogen for me was that there was no one else in the studio. There was no assistant; there was no engineer. It was her doing everything.\n\nHeap: I knew she loved [“Clean”]. She said she loved it and her mum loved it. But I wasn’t sure it would be included on the album. But everyone felt it had something special. It came together really magically.\n\nNiklas Ljungfelt (guitarist): I played on “Style,” a song I started with Ali Payami for ourselves. He was playing it for Max Martin at his studio; Taylor overheard it and loved it. She and Max wrote new lyrics. But I recorded the guitar on it before it was a Taylor song. It was an instrumental. I didn’t have a clue that Taylor would sing on it. The inspiration came from Daft Punk and funky electronic music. Taylor liked that a lot when she heard the song the first time. [She was] taking a big step from the music she had done before.\n\nSwift: “Blank Space” was the third thing I played [Max and Shellback]. And they [said], “No, this is the very first thing we are working on today!” It’s a very sparse track. We just wanted it to be about the lyric and the vocal.\n\nMattias Bylund (string arranger): We were listening to a mix when Max Martin came in and said that he wanted me to listen to [some songs]. We got to hear “Shake It Off” and “Wildest Dreams.” We immediately realized these were going to be future hits, and I was really happy to get the mission to arrange and record strings on “Wildest Dream.” I recorded them in my home studio in Tuve, Sweden. The Mellotron notes through the song were there, and the staccato strings in the chorus, those I dubbed with real strings. I added some big chords and a build-up in the bridge. On the choruses I recorded Coldplay-type rhythm chords.\n\nJonas Thander (saxophonist): I recorded alto and tenor sax [for “Shake It Off”] at my studio in Sweden. Max had recorded some MIDI horn ideas for me, and I came up with my own parts. It had no vocals when I did my part. I recorded all my horn parts, and then overdubbed other players, and edited it in a 10-hour overnight session. Sounds like a lot but I’m really picky. Then I did it all over again after the next recording day. But I love it, so no real harm done on me. People think it’s a baritone horn on the [“Shake It Off”] intro, but it’s a Mellotron.\n\nSwift: The Mellotron was really helpful for us in coming up with sounds. Sometimes we later replaced them with real instruments.\n\nThander: The first time I heard Taylor’s vocals was when the song was released. It sounded amazing. Those guys really know what they’re doing.\n\nLaura Sisk (engineer): I worked with [producer] Jack Antonoff on three songs, “Out Of The Woods,” “You Are In Love” and “I Wish You Would.” It was just Jack and I in the studio for a lot of the tracking. Especially on “Out Of The Woods.” He and Taylor were collaborating long distance and would send ideas back and forth rapid-fire. The songs came together really quickly. There was a lot of excitement surrounding the music.\n\nWhen we got Taylor’s vocals for “Out Of The Woods,” I couldn’t stop listening to it. I love the chorus so much and when her background vocals kick in at the end, it brings this anthemic feeling to the song that you can feel even just a cappella.\n\n\nLaura Sisk | Photo: Daniel Silbert\nTom Coyne (mastering engineer): My job was easy. Max Martin’s collaboration with Taylor Swift pretty much assured the album was going to be big, bold and beautiful. I mastered the whole album in two days. When working with professionals of this caliber, things go smoothly.\n\nHeap: [Taylor is] a force of nature.\n\n\nThe 58th GRAMMY Awards nominees for one of the most coveted GRAMMYs comprise an eclectic quintet of artists. This year’s Album Of The Year nominees span roots rock quartet Alabama Shakes’ vibrant Sound & Color, rapper Kendrick Lamar’s timely To Pimp A Butterfly, country singer/songwriter Chris Stapleton’s organic Traveller, Taylor Swift’s pop juggernaut 1989, and The Weeknd’s seductive R&B collection Beauty Behind The Madness.\n\nThe Recording Academy asked some of the artists and key collaborators behind these projects to tell the inside story of each nominated album.

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift As You’ve Never Seen Her Before\nPop queen, power broker, hater vanquisher—Taylor Swift’s star has never been brighter. On a trip to her childhood home, she wonders: What (on earth) will she do next?\n\nBY NOW YOU KNOW that the past few years have been extraordinary ones in the life of Taylor Swift. Even if you have only casual knowledge of Swift’s music—there may be six or seven souls left on the planet who can’t sing all the words to “Shake It Off”—you’re aware that Swift has become not only one of the most successful recording artists ever, but also an unrivaled power broker who has prevailed in a volatile media economy and brought today’s music overlords to heel. Swift’s 2015 stare-down of Apple—she declined to put her hit album 1989 on Apple’s nascent streaming-music service when the company said it would not pay artists during its initial launch; Apple changed its policy immediately and paid everyone—was a seismic example of a single artist’s toppling corporate might. At 26, Swift is world famous, wealthy, critically celebrated, a style influencer, and a cultural movement unto herself, recognizable everywhere she goes. She also has two awesome cats.\n\nAnd yet today, in this chapel atop a hill in Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift is none of those things. She is the maid of honor at the wedding of her childhood friend Britany Maack. Swift and Maack have known each other since Swift was ten days old and have stayed close—there are grainy home videos of the two romping around a crib together and, more recently, photos of them sitting side by side at the 2014 Grammys. Last spring, after Swift accepted Britany’s invitation to be maid of honor via Instagram—kids today!—she took Maack to Reem Acra, where Britany got fitted for her custom hand-embroidered silk-taffeta wedding gown and Taylor for the blush-pink, cap-sleeved chiffon maid-of-honor dress that she has on today (the fitting was also Instagrammed, naturally). Swift has even known the groom, Benjamin LaManna, since kindergarten—she admits to having had a little crush on Ben way back then, when he was “that kid who sat next to me in class with the bowl cut and the Lego lunch box.”\n\nSwift hasn’t been to Reading in more than a decade; she was fourteen when she moved with her family to Nashville, on her way to becoming a celebrated country singer-songwriter and later blossoming into one of the biggest pop acts in music history. Returning to the place where you grew up can be a bit of a mind-bender for anyone, and Swift is no different. During a car ride earlier in the day, she excitedly pointed out landmarks: the creek where she and Britany used to play as kids; a weathered tree house in the front yard of the former Maack family home; the piney woods she and her friends used to think were haunted.\n\n“It’s such a surreal, emotional thing,” Swift says. “When you’re a little kid, you’re riding the same roads to school every single day, hundreds of times. When you come back, you snap into that strange nostalgia.”\n\nAnd the church! There are nuns here at Sacred Heart Chapel who taught Swift in kindergarten. Many of the wedding guests have known her for just as long. To them, Swift is not the superstar who, a handful of days ago, stood on a stage in Los Angeles and accepted a Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the first woman to win that prize twice. No, that maid of honor, currently fussing over and straightening out the train of the bride’s gown, is Taylor—Scott and Andrea Swift’s older kid, Austin’s big sister, who grew up barely a five-minute drive away and used to go for ice cream at the Friendly’s down the street.\n\nTo be clear: I’m not saying the people in this church aren’t aware that Scott and Andrea’s kid turned into, you know, Taylor Freakin’ Swift—it’s hilarious to watch the flower girls try to keep it together, and the nuns seem pretty jazzed, too—but that’s not the story today. Britany and Ben are. And the only evidence that the maid of honor is you-know-who is the paparazzi who have gathered at the bottom of the hill, hoping to snag a photo with their long lenses.\n\nWE NEED TO TALK about the Christmas-tree farm.\n\nA treasured footnote to the Taylor Swift backstory is that she spent much of her childhood being raised at, of all places, a Christmas-tree nursery called Pine Ridge Farm. It is the kind of quaint, Norman Rockwell–ian detail that sounds a bit too precious, too good to be true. Weren’t her parents in finance? Didn’t she grow up in the burbs? How was this possibly real? Come on.\n\nThe Christmas-tree farm is real. She showed me herself.\n\nIt’s the morning of the wedding, and I am riding in an SUV with Swift and her mother, Andrea. Andrea is powering down the road, and Swift, dressed in a caramel-colored Reformation jacket and a pair of black jeans, is sitting passenger side. This area around Reading and its adjacent town, Wyomissing, is rich with pastoral roads marked by open fields and stone homes, and the kind of rolling countryside that makes you want to saddle up and ride a horse—which Swift did as a child.\n\n“That was kind of my mom’s thing,” Taylor says. “She really wanted me to be a horseback rider, and I did it competitively until I worked up the nerve at age twelve to tell her I didn’t really love it like she loved it.\n\n“I just wanted to make music and do theater,” she says. “So I’ve been a big disappointment.”\n\n“I’ve gotten over the bitterness, finally,” Andrea says sarcastically.\n\nSoon we arrive at a clearing with a barn and a small farmhouse. This is the place, they tell me. Taylor and Andrea have not made any calls or arrangements about visiting. It’s going to be a random drop-in from a pop star, like the Taylor Swift Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes or something.\n\nTaylor notices a man stepping into his car in the driveway. We pull up alongside, and Andrea rolls down her window. Taylor leans over. “I used to live here,” she says brightly.\n\nThe man immediately gives what can only be described as a Holy crap–it’s–Taylor Swift look. “I know,” he says, as if on cue.\n\nEveryone laughs. The man’s name is Dave Schaeffer, and he has lived here with his wife, Debbie, for about six years. He invites us to have a look around, and we all pile out.\n\n“This must really bring back some memories,” Dave says.\n\n“Yeah, this is crazy,” Taylor says. She surveys the fields behind the driveway, which include a small grove of pine trees her parents once planted. They now look tall enough for Christmas at Rockefeller Center. “It’s beautiful.”\n\nThis is where, Andrea tells me, Taylor Swift was brought home from the hospital in, well, 1989—I guess everyone knows the year of Taylor’s birth by now. The split-rail fence that’s still standing—Scott and Andrea built that themselves. Scott, a stockbroker, actually purchased and lived on the property before he’d met Andrea; on their first date, she came to a party he hosted in the farmhouse.\n\nDebbie comes outside and introduces herself. “I always thought you might want to stop by,” she says. “But I never wanted to bother you.” The Schaeffers confess they lived here for a while before they learned about the famous former resident. “The pizza guy told us,” Debbie says. “We had no idea.”\n\nShe invites everyone inside. As we step into the cozy two-floor home, Taylor takes out her phone and starts filming. There’s the living room where the Swifts put their family Christmas tree. There’s where they once put the piano.\n\nCasey, Dave and Debbie’s daughter, arrives. She actually owns the house with her husband and lives nearby. She’s thrilled but also beside herself that her two daughters are away skiing for the day.\n\n“You want to see your room?” Debbie asks Taylor.\n\nWe go upstairs into a small corner room where a tiny Taylor used to demand three books and five songs every night. Taylor gathers the family together to make a quick video for the Schaeffers’ granddaughters, Siena and Tarah.\n\n“Hi, Siena and Tarah,” Taylor says cheerily. “This used to be my room. We wish you were here so bad.”\n\nI can’t lie: All I can think of is Siena and Tarah returning from their ski trip to learn that Taylor Swift was hanging out at their grandparents’ house, and deciding right then they will never go skiing ever again.\n\nOn the ride back, Andrea and Taylor sound almost overcome by what has just happened—by the sweet and polite and utterly un–freaked out mood of the whole experience. “My faith in humanity is restored,” Taylor says.\n\nAnd then she turns her head quickly away from the window: paparazzi.\n\nYES: I SHOULD NOTE that when we arrived at the farm, we were informed by a couple of Swift’s security people that there were at least a trio of uninvited photographers who had followed us to the location to catch some hot, sexy farm-visit action. To Swift, this is about as surprising as . . . what is the exact opposite of surprise? This is her constant state. She lives with it, adapts to it. Just a few years back, Swift was so excited about relocating to New York City—it was the creative basis for 1989—but when she’s in the city now, within a couple of days, there is a circus of photographers outside her apartment building.\n\n“But that kind of happens everywhere,” she says. The wedding ceremony has finished—Britany and Ben made it official to applause—and Swift and I have huddled downstairs at the church during a break before the reception.\n\nI ask her: When was the last time you were in a place where nobody in the press had any idea you were there—no reporters, no photographers?\n\n“Mmmm, Colorado’s good,” she says. “If I go somewhere and stay in a house, nobody knows.”\n\nSwift says she is ready to lie a little low. After the wedding, she will go to New York, where she will be spotted dining with her friend Lena Dunham, and then be seen a week later in Los Angeles with her brother, Austin, and her friend Lorde at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party. As for future plans . . . who knows? For the first time in years, Swift is not sure exactly what is next. She is very much OK with this.\n\nSo what the hell are you going to do with the rest of your life, Taylor Swift?\n\n“I have no idea,” she says, with a sigh that’s more blissful than anxious. “This is the first time in ten years that I haven’t known. I just decided that after the past year, with all of the unbelievable things that happened . . . I decided I was going to live my life a little bit without the pressure on myself to create something.”\n\nDo not freak: Swift is not abandoning making music. Those who know her know this is chemically impossible. (“Her not being creative is one of the last things I’d ever worry about,” the musician and producer Jack Antonoff tells me later.)\n\n“I’m always going to be writing songs,” Swift says. “The thing is, with me, I could very well come up with three things in the next two weeks and then jump back into the studio, and all of a sudden the next record is started. That’s an option, too.”\n\nBut probably not for the moment. “I would really like to take a little time to learn things,” Swift says. “I have lots of short-term goals.”\n\nSuch as?\n\n“I want to be a well-rounded person who can make a good drink.” (I can confirm from the wedding’s cocktail gathering that Taylor Swift enjoys an Old Fashioned and knows how to make one.)\n\nAnything else?\n\n“To be able to save somebody if they’re drowning,” she says. She’s completely serious. “So CPR, all the various kinds of chest compressions. People tell you little tips, but that’s different from actually taking a class and getting certified.”\n\nCan you change a tire?\n\n“No. I should probably know how to do that.\n\n“I do things like this,” Swift says. Once, “I got it in my head that I couldn’t do a split, and I was really upset about it. And so I stretched every single day for a year until I could do a split. Somehow I feel better knowing that I can.”\n\nI ask her if she’d ever consider launching a fashion line.\n\n“Theoretically, yes,” she says. “But I would want it to be something that was relatable and accessible and everyday. I don’t see it being couture. I would want it to be reflective of my style. And a lot of things I wear are not highly expensive.”\n\nIn May, Swift will cochair the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute’s 2016 gala, for the exhibition “Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology.” It is a topic Swift—easily one of the biggest style icons of the social-media era—understands better than most, from technology’s ability to shape trends to its growing influence on creativity and design.\n\nSwift’s personal style has, not surprisingly, matured over the course of her career, migrating from the early days of sundresses and, as she describes them, “bedazzled cowboy boots” to the vintage fifties vibe of a few years ago to the sleeker, street-conscious look she favors now. “I can look back at an old photo and tell you roughly what year it’s from,” Swift says. “Going through different phases is one of my favorite things about fashion. I love how it can mark the passage of time. It’s similar to my songs in that way—it all helps identify where I was at in different points of my life.”\n\nHer style has never been deliberately provocative or fad-chasing—on the contrary, there’s always been a kind of effortless appropriateness to Swift, a quality she shares with her friend the Midwest-raised model Karlie Kloss—and yet it’s easy to see a curiosity about new things. Recently Swift cut her hair into a sharp bob, and she’s been seen strutting in a pair of Gothy, over-the-ankle Vetements boots that look stolen from the closet of Siouxsie Sioux. As usual, the changes are small, recognizable—a genius of Swift’s, from music to everything else, is experimentation without alienation. Swift’s style never tries too hard or appears publicity-craving; everyone’s already paying attention, anyway.\n\nBecause I’m a hopeless cheeseball, I can’t help asking: Being part of this wedding, does it make Swift think about being married some day? For the past year, she has been seeing the Scottish DJ-producer Calvin Harris. Harris is not here with her, but in early March, he and Swift will post cutesy notices on social media—his on Snapchat; hers on Instagram—commemorating the one-year status of their relationship. Soon after, both will post photographs of an idyllic, whereabouts-unknown vacation in the tropics, with ts + aw written in the sand. (Harris’s given name is Adam Wiles.)\n\n“I’m just taking things as they come,” Swift says. “I’m in a magical relationship right now. And of course I want it to be ours, and low-key . . . this is the one thing that’s been mine about my personal life.”\n\nSwift’s friend Lorde thinks that Swift can only withdraw from music for so long. “We talk about this—in order to do good work, write these deeply personal records, we’re constantly in a place of metacognition. Sometimes it can feel like you’re a scholar writing a thesis about your own brain,” Lorde says. “So I think she’s going to try to pick up some new skills, maybe take courses in something. Tay is a big fan of taking time off until about month two—and then she gets this look in her eyes, and I know all the Dateline and frozen yogurt and mooching around is about to go out the window.”\n\nHere on a basement floor of the country club, where the bride is adjusting her gown, Swift and I hear the cocktail party gaining steam. A pair of bridesmaids stroll by. Swift gives them high fives.\n\n“Honestly, I never relax, and I’m excited about being able to relax for the first time in ten years,” she says.\n\nSwift takes a sip of her Old Fashioned. “I feel relaxed right now.”\n\nJUST A FEW DAYS before, Swift had been in the thick of it. In her Grammy acceptance speech for Album of the Year, she’d offered stirring words to women in the audience, but also made what was presumed to be a less-than-veiled reply to Kanye West, who’d released a new song in which he’d bragged he’d made Swift famous and tackily theorized the pair would one day have sex. The story pinged around on social media for the next 72 hours and generally made me want to put a metal pail on my head and bang it loudly against a wall.\n\nHadn’t this whole Kanye vs. Taylor nonsense—which began, of course, seven years ago, when West barged into Swift’s MTV Video Music Awards acceptance speech to argue that Beyoncé should have won—been declared over? Taylor Nation was aghast. Austin Swift posted an Instagram video in which he casually tossed a pair of West’s Adidas Yeezy sneakers into the garbage.\n\nI tell Swift the whole thing reminded me of Al Pacino’s famous line as the aging Mafia don Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part III.\n\n“ ‘I thought I was out . . .’ ”\n\nSwift knows exactly where I am going and finishes it: “ ‘They pull me back in!’ ”\n\n“I think the world is so bored with the saga,” she goes on. “I don’t want to add anything to it, because then there’s just more.”\n\nI get why Swift would not want to fuel the dispute, but it’s not hard to see a connection between West’s credit-taking and the long tradition of men being dismissive—actively as well as subconsciously mansplainy—of the hard work and success of women. This is something Swift has become hardened to, having spent much of her early years being mainly recognized not for her songwriting gifts (which just about everyone now agrees are rare and special) but for who she was dating, her fame distilled into what Swift calls “my incredibly sexist Men–of–Taylor Swift slideshows.”\n\n“You know, I went out on a normal amount of dates in my early 20s, and I got absolutely slaughtered for it,” she says. “And it took a lot of hard work and altering my decision-making. I didn’t date for two and a half years. Should I have had to do that? No.\n\n“I guess what I wanted to call attention to in my speech at the Grammys was how it’s going to be difficult if you’re a woman who wants to achieve something in her life—no matter what,” she adds.\n\nThe day after the awards, Swift went shopping at Barneys in Beverly Hills—“I was like, ‘I’m going to buy some nice shoes today’ ”—and says she was approached by a number of women, mothers in particular, who thanked her. “Their response was really beautiful. You never know what anyone’s response is going to be. So when it’s good, it’s really nice.”\n\nSwift has reached a level of fame at which unsolicited drama just finds her. The Men–of–Taylor Swift slideshows have calmed down, but she now takes grief for her “squad” of celebrity female friends, who, depending on the jab, are either too glam or too phony or some combination of the two.\n\n“Ugh,” Swift says when I bring it up. “I’ve had people say really hurtful things about me, and so I’ve kind of learned how to gauge it: ‘This is, like, low-to-medium-level hurtful.’\n\n“There are a lot of really easy ways to dispel rumors,” she explains. “If they say you are pregnant, all you have to do is continue to not be pregnant and not have a baby. If the rumor is that you have fake friendships, all you have to do is continue to be there for each other. And when we’re all friends in fifteen years and raising our kids together, maybe somebody will look back and go, ‘That was kind of ridiculous what we said about Taylor and her friends.’ ”\n\nIt’s as if Swift has become so big, so enticing a target, that she is no longer a mere person but a cultural symbol from which anything can be demanded. Jack Antonoff describes Swift’s status as “almost like being president.” He adds, “She’s the biggest, but a lot of people have been the biggest. Not a lot of people have been the biggest and the best, and she is.”\n\nAll of that feels a million light-years away, here, back home, among friends, at Britany’s wedding. Before we part, Swift makes a request: She needs to practice her maid-of-honor speech. Now.\n\nAnd so, in a basement corridor at the country club, Swift recites her maid-of-honor speech, which she has memorized.\n\nI don’t have to tell you that Taylor Swift’s maid-of-honor speech is great. Of course it’s great.\n\nHERE'S ONE OTHER THING about this wedding: Brit­any and Ben made the brilliant decision, which apparently is becoming a bit of a thing with twenty-first-century nuptials, to politely ask their guests to not bring their phones. So from the ceremony to the receptions and the toasts, people actually paid attention to the bride and groom—they focused, laughed, existed in the now. “All of our guests were present,” Britany tells me later. “I truly attribute this to everyone unplugging from distractions and enjoying the moment.”\n\nWhen the time comes, Swift grabs the mic and delivers her maid-of-honor address with the unperturbed calm of someone who does this kind of thing before 50,000 people. She tells the story of having a crush on kindergarten-era Ben with his bowl cut and Lego lunch box. She talks about how, as toddlers, Britany was the physical one, and she was the verbal one. “Essentially what you had were these two babies who each made up for what the other lacked,” Swift says. “One couldn’t really walk. One couldn’t really talk. And interestingly enough, we assume those exact personas to this day when we are drunk . . . give us an hour.”\n\nThe room goes crazy.\n\nA few beats later, Swift has everyone teary when she talks about the “real love” she sees between Britany and Ben. “Real love doesn’t mess with your head,” she says. “Real love just is. Real love just endures. Real love maintains. Real love takes it page by page.”\n\n(I told you it was a good speech.)\n\nLater on, there will be cake. Later on, there will be dancing, those flower girls getting a story that is going to totally blow their classmates’ minds at school on Monday. Later on, the wedding band will entice Swift to the stage, where she will sing “Shake It Off” for her childhood friend on her wedding night and an audience that for the first time in history isn’t waving 10,000 smartphones in her face. The night—the whole weekend—is storybook warm. You know the old Thomas Wolfe novel You Can’t Go Home Again? Sometimes it’s really true.\n\nBut Taylor Swift did.\n\n",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: 25 Things You Don’t Know About Me! (Exclusive)\nBy Us Weekly Staff \n\nAre you ready for it? In honor of Taylor Swift’s release of her sixth studio album, Reputation, Us Weekly is throwing back to a very special edition of 25 Things You Don’t Know About Me. See what the the star, now 27, exclusively told Us about herself — including how she wears red lipstick “every day” in the summertime and who she calls three times a day.\n\n1. My lucky number is 13, but I also consider 31 to be lucky because it’s 13 backwards. Other lucky numbers for me are 89, 26 and 39.\n\n2. I used to wear a Victoria’s Secret Pink hoodie and sweatpants to school on a regular basis. \n\n3. I used to keep hermit crabs as pets when I was a kid. One summer, I lost my pet hermit crab before I had to leave the shore to go back to school. I came back to the house that winter and I found my hermit crab wandering around the house still alive. \n\n4. I like it much more when people come up and ask for a picture in a restaurant rather than when they just point their camera at me and take one. It feels like a real human interaction that way.\n\n5. I talk to my mom on the phone roughly three times a day.\n\n6. I wear red lipstick almost every day in the summertime.\n\n7. My favorite colors to wear in the fall are maroon, mustard, dark green and navy blue.\n\n8. My cats have nicknames. Olivia’s is “Dibbles” and Meredith’s is “MerBear.”\n\n9. I’ve never broken a bone (except my little toe, but that doesn’t count because I didn’t get a cast).\n\n10. I can’t watch Pocahontas without crying.\n\n11. I’m double-jointed in my elbows.\n\n12. I was the maid of honor for my childhood best friend Britany’s wedding. I went to kindergarten with her husband.\n\n13. It was the first time I was in a wedding.\n\n14. My favorite stone is an opal because when I was bullied in school, my mom used to take me to T.J. Maxx after school to look at the opal jewelry. I thought opals were so beautiful, and somehow it made me feel better. We never bought them, just looked.\n\n15. I watch Dateline nonstop.\n\n16.I love sushi but I usually ask for soy paper instead of seaweed paper because once I ate actual seaweed at the beach as a child, and it left a lasting bad impression.\n\n17. I have to mute any horror movie commercial that comes on TV. I cannot handle it.\n\n18. I’m a huge fan of the Food Network and HGTV. I love Fixer Upper and Barefoot Contessa.\n\n19. I’m very aware that youth and fame don’t last forever, so I make the most of this every day.\n\n20. When I was in high school, I used to give my friends Mace for their key chains so they could defend themselves if they needed to.\n\n21. I wrote “I Knew You Were Trouble” on piano and originally imagined it as a slow ballad.\n\n22. I used to have a pug named Nelly. It was named that because I really liked the rapper Nelly. When I performed with Nelly on my tour, I did not tell him this.\n\n23. My best friend from high school, Abigail, and I used to hang out in her room, speak in Napoleon Dynamite voices and eat tubes of cookie dough.\n\n24. I can’t do a handstand.\n\n25. Or a cartwheel.",

      "Transcript/Content": "The Producer’s Chair: Chad Carlson\nMay 16, 2016 by contributor\n\nBy James Rea\n\nDon’t miss 2-Time Grammy recipient Chad Carlson on The Producer’s Chair on Thursday, May 26 at Douglas Corner at 6 p.m.\n\nTalking to Chad Carlson at his poolside Cabana home studio about his producing and engineering discography, his never-ending passion for female voices is reflected in his body of work.\n\nCarlson’s credits include four albums with Taylor Swift and two with Trisha Yearwood, as well as work with Alison Krauss, Brandy Clark, Sugarland, Jewel, Lady Antebellum/Stevie Nicks, Janis Ian, Thompson Square, Jana Kramer, Maddie & Tae, Matraca Berg, Rachel Proctor, Mickey Guyton, Katie Armiger and Point Of Grace, as well as male artists like Chase Rice, Love & Theft, Blues Traveler, Randy Houser, and Cole Swindell.\n\nThe list gives you an idea of how busy Carlson has been since he arrived in Nashville in 2002.\n\nCarlson hails from Orlando, Florida, where his mother was a choir director, and his (deacon) father played trombone. Carlson mastered the French horn in high school, which led to a scholarship at Southern Adventist University in Collegedale, Tennessee, and a seat in the Chattanooga Symphony. He played guitar in rock bands on the side before attending and graduating from the Conservatory of Recording Arts & Sciences in Phoenix.\n\nAdmittedly, Carlson didn’t have his sights set on Nashville and certainly not on country music. His influences musically were artists like Prince, The Police and Madonna, so L.A. and New York seemed like the logical place to be. But country music had evolved and Chad’s wife Amanda wanted to be near her parents in Chattanooga, so he agreed that if she could land the interior design job she wanted, he’d give Nashville a shot.\n\nHis first intern job at Sound Stage Studios, after graduating from the conservatory in Phoenix, led to becoming Garth Fundis’ chief engineer at Sound Emporium. To this day, Carlson proudly calls Fundis a mentor. But every bird must leave the nest and as Carlson’s engineering and production skills became more in-demand, he opened his own Hippo Sound Studio, where his prosperity and his propensity for producing truly emerged over the next six to seven years before finally moving into his new Cabana Studio facility.\n\nBeing a double Grammy-winning engineer (for Swift’s Fearless) has also given Carlson the opportunity to work with some of the best producers in the business including Nathan Chapman, Russ Titelman, Norbert Putnam, Josh Leo, Stan Lynch, Mickey Jack Cones, Derek George, Dann Huff, Fred Mollin, Ross Copperman, Julian King, Sam Ellis, Chris Lindsey, T Bone Burnett, and Victoria Shaw.\n\nCarlson signed his current co-publishing deal with Shaw and well-respected publisher Leslie DiPiero/Tom Leis Publishing, in 2012. Carlson has written songs for David Cook, The Scott Brothers (from TV’s Property Brothers), and Jana Kramer.\n\nBeing an engineer, a symphony-level musician, and a songwriter — and having a background in arranging and composition with one’s own studio and two Grammys already in hand — has postured Carlson perfectly for today’s new breed of artists and tight-budgeted projects.\n\nThe Producer’s Chair: Through the course of four albums, you’ve watched Taylor Swift develop and mature. What was the most outstanding thing you noticed about Taylor?\n\nCarlson: Her professionalism was better than almost anybody I’ve ever worked with. She was dedicated. She wanted to get it right. She was appreciative. As a 14-year-old, she knew how to look you in the eye and be thankful, and be present and she was smart about the music. There’s a lot of artists that come in, sing their part, and let the producer tell you what they want to do and she wasn’t like that. She was really involved from the get-go. She’s a smart girl.\n\nWe were all young. I think part of the magic from the first record was, it was raw. It was honest, it wasn’t perfect. It wasn’t anything like Fearless. You could see kind of a graduation, for all of us, in every record. Every record became a little smarter or a little more well-thought-out. Her songwriting grew, and she quickly became a world class artist!\n\nHow did it feel to receive a Grammy?\n\nWe were in shock I think. And so proud for Taylor. She deserved it and I felt so lucky to be part of it all. It was so awkward walking up on stage though. I thought I was going to get gang-tackled — it was the Album of the Year so, it was the final Grammy of the night. I don’t know if you ever been to the Staples Center. We were way back in the engineer/producer section and Taylor is right up in the second row. So we’re all running and she’s already talking and we just sort of walked in behind her and started giving hugs, but yeah, it was one of the best moments of my life.\n\nKnowing what’s out there, would you prefer to produce a male artist, a female artist or a group, at this point in time?\n\nThe struggle for me is my passion is always been female artists. I love Madonna. I love Fiona Apple and really great female artists. When I got here, I was so spoiled because one of the first things I worked on was Trisha Yearwood and she’s truly probably the best female singer I’ve ever heard. Me coming from a background of not country music, I think females at that time were getting away with really intellectual songs and singing about things that I could identify with.\n\nWhen you are producing an artist, how involved do you get in the song selection process?\n\nI try to be involved because it’s really important. It all depends if it’s an independent artist or a label demanding them to do certain songs. A lot of times, I’ll find them songs. I have lots of publisher friends now, and if I write them an email, I hope that they’ll assume that it’s quality enough for them to pitch me good songs.\n\nAs you produce more, are your engineering gigs diminishing?\n\nI don’t want to be known as “Chad Carlson, only the producer,” because you know what? I love engineering. My successes over the past 13-14 years are in engineering and it will always be because I get to work with so many artists. Engineering nowadays is so close to producing.\n\nWhat’s the best advice you can give new producers?\n\nI think a lot of producing is learning how not to do things. I have seen a couple different producers that ruin their artist by not knowing how to lift them up and really make them second guess themselves as singers. It’s hard. I’ve also had some young producers that will get in the room, they’ll play the work tape for the band, and they’ll say, “Listen, guitar player, don’t do this. I’m thinking you should play this. Bass player, I want you to stay on the one. Drummer, four on the floor, don’t mess it up.” And they’ll ruin a track because they don’t let the band be themselves.\n\nThe best producers let the players try whatever they want and then bring them in and say, “OK, let’s go to halftime on the bridge, let’s not try this time thing here—let’s do this.” It’s like when I have a singer in my vocal booth. When they’ll sing, I’ll make a mark, like 10 things they do wrong in their verse. I’m sure as heck not going to tell them those 10 things they did wrong because all they’re going to do is think about those 10 things. I have to find a way to distract them to not do those things.\n\nHow difficult is it to keep up with the constant technological advances?\n\nI think it all has to do with the digital audio work stations. If you know Pro Tools, it’s not that hard, but I have to constantly buy new software. You have to keep up. There’s so much more track-based music nowadays. Listen to Sam Hunt’s record. The records were mostly made in Pro Tools in a room like this. It’s a whole new kind of sub-genre of country music, which I love, but you definitely have to be aware of the technology. It’s not like it was when I started with Garth [Fundis]. We had a tape machine and radar. Luckily I came to town already knowing Pro Tools and I was already building tracks. You have to stay aware.\n\nDo you have an A-team of musicians that you primarily call?\n\nA lot of producers have a set of players and that’s their guys. I don’t do that. I want to be transparent. I want the right group of players for the project. I am so lucky because I have been engineering for so long and I’ve worked with pretty much all the players in Nashville. So I can tell you, if you need drums that are swampy, who to get — or if you want something with drums with a bunch of technology like loops and stuff, who the right guy is. Or something that’s really appropriate [if somebody wants] “a Miranda kind of thing.” That’s one of the benefits of being an engineer/producer. You learn who is really right because you see producers hire somebody and they may not be right. You learn from their mistakes.\n\nWhat’s on the horizon for Chad Carlson?\n\nI have three artists right now. The most ready to blow up in my opinion is a guy named Carter Winter. He’s booked by APA with Jim Butler and he has 50 shows this summer. Mark Bright produced five songs for him and I just produced five more. He has a really deep, amazing voice, but it’s kind of a more aggressive music that’s a little more technology-based. He’s killing it on the road so Carter’s doing great.\n\nI’m working with Cody Belew, who was on The Voice a few years back. He’s an amazing singer. We just finished up his project. We did a record and he’s getting ready to start touring. And I’m finishing up a record right now with an artist named Kimberly Dunn. She’s a Texas artist. She’s killing it out there. She’s a functional touring artist. She’s a firecracker, man. We’re just finishing up an 11-song record.\n\nNext I’m super excited about a Don Williams tribute record I’m doing with Garth Fundis right now coming out on Slate Creek Records. We are doing an album full of big artists. We’re still waiting on lawyers and signatures, but I can tell you it’s pretty much all of my favorite artists in Nashville.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: Tim McGraw turns 10\n'Early on, she was breaking the rules,' Nathan Chapman tells EW\n\nBy Will Robinson Published on June 19, 2016 03:01PM EDT\n\nIt’s difficult to remember a time when Taylor Swift didn’t dominate the pop charts.\n\nHer self-titled debut album peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard 200, and ever since her second album, Fearless, her releases are basically guaranteed to hold down any number of No. 1 spots. But one song on Taylor Swift kick-started the then-16-year-old’s career: her first-ever single, “Tim McGraw,” which turns 10 on Sunday. The soft, heartbreaking track is about the end of a relationship, although feelings still linger. She penned it during her freshman year of high school — along with songwriter Liz Rose — about a former boyfriend going off to college.\n\nThe Swift-Rose pairing led Swift to work with Nathan Chapman. At the time, the country producer was working on demos for various Nashville, Tennessee artists. Swift’s talent immediately struck him. “She was a next-level songwriter,” he tells EW. “Being around a bunch of different songwriters, you can immediately tell when someone has something special as a writer, and that was immediately evident.”\n\nThe magic happened in a very unglamorous location, in a tiny studio behind the Jody Williams Music publishing company by Music Row. The publisher converted a one-car garage into a recording room, which was endearingly referred to as “The Shack.” It was directly behind the publishing house where the Swift and Rose penned “Tim McGraw.” “They literally walked down the stairs, out the backdoor, crossed the little sidewalk, and into ‘The Shack,’ and gave me the brand new song they had just written,” Chapman remembers. “I was in the right shack at the right time, I guess [laughs].”\n\nChapman described the first time he heard the song as “surreal,” not only because the title name-checked an incredibly popular artist. “It was such a different way of talking about love between two people,” Chapman says. “That’s just an indication early on of her genius as a songwriter. Early on, she was breaking the rules.”\n\nChapman took the work tape — a very rough version of a song — and put together a demo with other instruments and an idea on how to arrange them. He sought to re-create the emotion that swept him away the first time he heard it. Chapman’s main goal was to highlight the basics. “My hope was the first listen, you walk away, you felt like you heard Taylor and her acoustic,” he says.\n\nThey worked tirelessly to put out the track: Swift, Chapman, Rose, Swift’s mother Andrea, and Big Machine Records CEO Scott Borchetta all stuffed envelopes with “Tim McGraw” singles and sent them to radio stations. (Chapman even recalls that when he recorded his vocal harmony, Andrea fell asleep in the middle of the late-night recording session.) The tune landed at No. 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at No. 6 on Billboard‘s Hot Country Songs — a solid debut for Swift. It took two more tries to hit No. 1 on the country chart (“Our Song”) five more to break the top 10 of the Hot 100 (“Change”).\n\n“It’s so right for her as an artist to have taken this journey she’s been on,” Chapman says. “That’s what a good artist does: They do something to catch you just a little bit off-guard, but the execution of their idea is so perfect, that it’s undeniable.”\n\nSwift and Chapman caught up in November over dinner in Los Angeles — far from the days of The Shack. “Whether she’s making pop music or she comes back and makes a country record and we work together on that album it doesn’t matter,” Chapman asserts. “We’ll always be fast friends with them.”",

I was 14 at the time and Swift did not like me in the least (nor I her), but the character she played in a Berks Youth Theater version of “Bye Bye Birdie” was in love with the character I played.\n\nBut off stage, Swift and my “relationship” could not have been more different than our fictional alter egos, Kim MacAfee and Conrad Birdie. She was the established star of the group and I was a newcomer, spurred to do the play simply because it seemed like a fun thing. However, (pardon the ego), I was quite good at my role and Swift didn’t seem to enjoy sharing the spotlight.\n\nWe barely if ever talked when we weren’t reading lines that required our interaction and, after one performance, Swift ripped down a series of pictures of me, crumpled them and threw them against a wall.\n\nIn all fairness, she was an ambitious young girl who was destined to go far and I was a brash intruder into her world.\n\nIt’s understandable we didn’t get along.\n\nHowever, it doesn’t seem as if Swift has changed all that much from her days of ripping down my photos. Only now, she’s become famous for ripping her various ex-boyfriends in songs after their breakups.\n\nSo don’t feel too bad, Calvin. I’ve been there.",

But Gigi Hadid recently revealed that Tay is back in the studio once again.\n\nGigi dropped this little truth nugget when she explained to ET her excitement over Taylor taking time away from making music to support Gigi's collection with Tommy Hilfiger.\n\n\"She's obviously such a great friend,\" Gigi shared. \"And you know she is starting to go back to work in the studio again, and really made time to be here for me, and I am so grateful for that.\"\n\nEEK! Seriously can't wait for this one. Taylor is known for writing straight from life experiences, and with all that's happened in the last two years (and the last two months especially), she's got lots of material to work with.\n\nIt also should be noted that Taylor has dropped a new album every two years around October/November since 2006, so fans have been anxiously waiting to see if she will grace the world with new music come fall. And if she does, will she go back to her country roots? Will it be more pop?! It looks like the world will know soon enough.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift’s Label Boss Scott Borchetta Talks 10th Anniversary of Her Debut Album: ‘It Was a Lightning Bolt For Me’\nTaylor Swift's label boss, Big Machine Records' founder Scott Borchetta, spoke to Billboard about the 10th anniversary of her self-titled debut album and how he knew she was going to be a star from…\n\nSometimes it just feels right. When Big Machine Records founder Scott Borchetta met a then-15-year-old Taylor Swift, he had no doubt the teenager was bound for greatness. Unlike some others in Nashville, Borchetta could sense that he was in the presence of an unusually talented, focused young woman who would change both their lives. “True talent is ageless,” he told Billboard about his feelings during that first meeting more than a decade ago. “The amount of songs in her and sophisticated ideas at 15 were pretty extraordinary.” \n\nBorchetta went deep on Taylor Swift, which was released 10 years ago today (Oct. 24), delving into the songs that touched him, the process of making the album and even pulling out some of the mind-blowing notes from his first few meetings with Taylor and her folks.\n\nTaylor was only 15 when you met her, and a number of people in Nashville had already passed because they thought she was too green. But you had no trepidation, right?\n\nI was blown away from the first minute all the way through to today. The songs have always been what’s been central to me and to our relationship. I got her songs immediately. You can never predict what it will become, but I knew we had someone really special. I look at my notes from the first meeting…\n\nOh wow, read me some of those notes!\n\nI put down ‘this could be your Mick Jagger.’ One page literally says, ‘Taylor takes Japan.’ Another was ‘cover or Rolling Stone, host Saturday Night Live.’ She had that type of energy where I thought, ‘man, we might be able to run the boards.’ It was a lightning bolt for me.\n\nHad you ever felt that before? \n\nFor me she was the first one we signed that was ‘game on’ for us.\n\nWhat sold you? Was it a song, something she said?\n\nFirst off she could go from being this really funny teenager with this great sense of humor to being incredibly sophisticated. I was all in from the beginning. There wasn’t ever that lifting an eyebrow like, ‘hmmm.’ You can have all personality in the world, the looks, etc., but if you don’t have the songs it doesn’t close the deal. I heard the songs first and then met her.\n\nThere’s something about letting a freshman in high school have songwriting credits on all the songs, including three solo credits. That still feels like a huge deal.\n\nOh yeah and nobody believed it. I would say, ‘look she’s a real writer.’ It was hard for people to [believe].\n\nWere you worried about releasing a first single named after a major country star? “Tim McGraw?” \n\nThat was my idea. When the song came to me it was called ‘When You Think Tim McGraw.’ I said, ‘Let’s just call it Tim McGraw.’ I told Taylor, ‘they won’t immediately remember your name, they’ll say who’s this young girl with this song about Tim McGraw?’ If you think back to the beginning of the label, we knew we had to strike quickly and aggressively and go for the brass ring. There was no building it for five years. You had this artist with a ridiculous desire and talent who was more than willing to lock arms and take this down. How can we cut in line and get there faster? She was all about it. She was a charging bull.\n\nDid you let Tim hear it first?\n\nAfter we cut it I went and played for Tim’s manager and he said, ‘wow okay, what do you want me to do?’ I said ‘I just want to make sure you and Mike Curb don’t sue me!’ He went home, played it for Tim, Tim played it for Faith [Hill] and she loved it.\n\nTalk about “Picture to Burn,” which kind of set the template for Taylor’s songs about hard breakups. Were you surprised at how upset it made her sound? \n\nNo, I loved it. I think that was the second or third song she played for me in our very first meeting. That was the song where I pointed and said ‘that’s a hit song,’ and I had her play it again. I heard the first line and said, ‘did you really just sing that?’ That might have been the moment where [she thought] ‘this guy gets me.’ The great ones regardless of the time have that edge. If it were 20 years earlier it still would have risen to the top. She had that teen angst in those songs that is really at the heart of great rock n’ roll. What was not usual at all was her taking you on and calling you out. Who is this young girl calling me out and really standing up for herself and demanding that you respect her space? It was such a… wow… who is this?\n\n“Teardrops On My Guitar” is one of the more traditional sounding ballads on the record, but it’s clearly from a teen perspective. Was there something about the vulnerability that spoke to you?\n\nWe talked a lot about it and I asked, ‘do you actually want to say Drew?’ We had a version where it was ‘you’ instead of ‘Drew.’ She said ‘the song’s this,’ and she was right. What I love about those early records — and it’s still with her but she’s spread the sonic playground so wide — if you listen to them there’s such a beautiful sadness to many of those things she wrote. Such a great heartbreak to her voice, you can’t just create that.\n\nListening now, “Our Song” is another pretty traditional track on the record — riding in the car, listening to the radio, it’s super twangy, banjos, front porch steps, praying, her mama’s there… but still it had that unmistakable feeling of a teenage voice trying to figure things out…\n\nThe lyrics were genius. I remember the first time she played it, it’s so visual. She’s talking about sneaking out of the house and it’s such a great visual of that teenage moment, but she wanted to have those Southern visuals as part of the narrative. When it’s a great artist they just suck all that in from around them and at the end of the day it’s just great storytelling. All those things are real. She did write those words on a napkin.\n\n“Tied Together With a Smile” has such a specific lyric about a young girl struggling with an eating disorder. \n\nThere’s real stories behind all of those songs and that girl was struggling mightily with food issues.\n\nNot something you typically hear in country songs…\n\nDo you hear it in any songs? You don’t have to handicap it. It’s such a personal and interesting take. Here’s this girl I go to school with who has real issues and she’s tied together with a smile. I remember first time I heard it [thinking] ‘where does it all come from?’\n\nThe story is that “Should’ve Said No” was added at the last minute and is one of the most powerful songs on the album. Why was it important to include it?\n\nOn the last day in the studio Taylor called me and she said she just finished a song and she really wanted to cut it and asked ‘do you need to hear it?’ I said ‘you sound pretty excited about it, just cut it.’ That was a very real moment and I just trusted her higher instincts. For all of our records I’ve left them open until literally the last possible day because she’s always writing and when she gets in creative zone… I learned very early on to leave the door open as long as you can because there may be one more thought she has to finish it in her mind. For most of our records she had something come through in the last minute that put a bow on it.\n\nIs there a specific memory you have that crystallizes that time in your mind? Before things went supernova?\n\nThere are so many because there was no plan B. We had to win. Maybe more for me than her, she was 15 and had her whole life ahead of her. For me this was my shot so whether we verbalized it or not we knew this was it. There were so many fun victories. The first thing that was a real validation was when she won the [2007 Country Music Association Awards best new artist] Horizon Award. At that moment when you’re starting a new label with no industry support, with a brand new artist with no industry support, for us to win for her — which she totally deserved it — and show the industry that we could win a major award. We felt like we were putting down an anchor here. And on our gold party night where I wore a platinum-colored tie. It was like, ‘congratulations on gold, but platinum is our goal.’\n\nDid you try to give her any direction that she rejected?\n\nShe was always very open. Her process is she’ll take things in and while she might at first say, ‘hey no,’ then she might call back and say, ‘I’ve been thinking about that and I’m gonna try it.’ Or ‘I’m gonna try it and then I’m gonna do this.’ Even with some early lyrics changes, she was so intuitive and such a sponge. The quickest learner that I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThat reminds me of what people said about Michael Jackson as a child, how he would study everything happening in the studio and then come back years later with his variation. It sounds like she was just soaking it all in.\n\nYou could see in her eyes when it was coming. She would literally go to this other place, step away, say something into her iPhone and then be like, ‘Okay, I’m back.’ You talk to Max Martin today and I would guess he would say she loves the collaboration because she’s always willing, but also very direct.\n\nIt ended up spending 277 weeks on the charts. You knew that would happen right?\n\n[Laughs] Dark Side of the Moon was truly the goal!\n\nI have to ask, what’s next? She’s traditionally released an album every two years in October and we’re running out of October. \n\nThe first rule of Taylor Club is you don’t talk about Taylor Club.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Keeping everything under wraps! Ed Sheeran described the insane security measures that BFF Taylor Swift takes to ensure that her new music doesn’t leak in a recent interview with Brazil’s Capricho magazine.\nWhen asked if Swift, 27, would ever digitally send Sheeran any snippets of her works in progress, the “Shape of You” singer said absolutely not. “She would never send new songs, no,” he said. “I hear them, but it has to be with her.”\n\nThe 25-year-old crooner further elaborated, “I remember when I did a song with her for her album, I was in San Francisco and they sent someone with a locked briefcase with an iPad and one song on it, and they flew to San Francisco and played the song I’ve done with her. And they asked if I like it, and I was like, ‘Yeah,’ and then they took it back. That’s how I hear it.” (The pair collaborated on her hit “Everything Has Changed,” off her Red album, in 2012.)\n\n“There’s an underdog element to it,” he told the magazine. “Taylor was never the popular kid in school. I was never the popular kid in school. Then you get to the point when you become the most popular kid in school — and we both take it a bit too far. She wants to be the biggest female artist in the world, and I want to be the biggest male artist in the world. It also comes from always being told that you can’t do something and being like, ‘F–k you. I can.’”",

Tom Hiddleston and Ed Sheeran Have Become Unlikely Besties\nEnglish stars have formed a close bond\nBy Francesca Bacardi Mar 07, 2017 6:08 PM| Updated Mar 07, 2017 6:08 PMTags\n\nWatch: Will Ed Sheeran Collaborate With BFF Taylor Swift?\n\nEd Sheeran first surprised fans when he became buddy-buddy with Katy Perry after she crashed his radio interview, and now the \"Eraser\" crooner has struck an unlikely friendship with Tom Hiddleston.\n\nEven though Tom is Taylor Swift's ex-boyfriend, Ed and Tom have maintained a friendship. In fact, they were friends before Hiddleswift's split, as the \"Eraser\" crooner met up with the former couple during their world travels. While Taylor and Tom were traversing through Rome, it turns out Ed met up with them.\n\n\"I got a good little preview [of the album] last summer,\" Tom said during a joint interview with Ed on BBC Radio 2.\n\n\"We were in Rome, weren't we?\" Ed added.\n\nHiddleswift traveled to Rome over the summer, where they took a private tour of the Coliseum and enjoyed many romantic meals before jetting off to their next European locale. \n\nEd and Tom continued to bond throughout their interview over music, romance and their artistic endeavors, so it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that Tom showed up to Ed's secret concert in New York City Monday night. The Kong: Skull Island actor was one of 400 fans who watched the British crooner perform acoustically in the intimate Studio at Webster Hall as part of Sirius XM's \"Secret Show\" series.\n\nThe BFFs solidified their bromance with a picture taken backstage. Some attendees also noted that Tom seemed to be \"living his best life\" while at the concert.\n\n\"Tom Hiddleston is here at the @edsheeran show sippin from a red solo cup & bopping his head along, in case you care bout that sort of thing,\" tweeted one concertgoer.\n\nEven though T.Swift and Ed are well-known BFFs, the \"Supermarket Flowers\" singer told Howard Stern that they never crossed that line into romance.\n\n\"When I first met Taylor I was in a relationship and she was in a relationship and we just formed a friendship through that,\" he said. \"And both our relationships ended and we just carried on being friends. There's nothing I really want more than friendship there. I know her very very well now and she knows me very very well.\"\n\nNow that Ed is fully back together with girlfriend Cherry Seaborn, he said that he and Taylor use each other as wingpeople. In fact, Cherry and Ed reconnected in part because of Taylor. \n\n\"She was like the world's best wingman. And also me and Cherry rekindled because I was doing shows in New York and Cherry lived in New York and we started hanging out again. But like the actual moment it probably rekindled was because Taylor was having her Fourth of July party and Cherry was like, 'I'm at a Fourth of July party in Rhode Island,'\" he recalled. \"And I was like, 'No way. Me, too.' Then Taylor was like, 'Yeah she should come down. Then she basically wingmanned that situation as well.\"\n\nHe added, \"She's a great wingman. I'd like to say that I helped wingman, too. Probably not as well.\"\n\nSo was he the wingman to her budding romance with Tom? Hmm...",

      "Transcript/Content": "A Conversation with Sarah Barlow and Stephen Schofield\nAs hard as we try to create affecting films and images, the truth is, the most important work is often done by amateurs, and it’s often done on accident. As writer David Shields says in Reality Hunger, “What, in the last half century, has been more influential than Abraham Zapruder’s 8mm film of the Kennedy assassination?” Similarly, what professional photographs have you seen recently that moved you as much as the pictures in your parents’ photo album?\n\n\n9 mins read\nShare\nAs hard as we try to create affecting films and images, the truth is, the most important work is often done by amateurs, and it’s often done on accident. As writer David Shields says in Reality Hunger, “What, in the last half century, has been more influential than Abraham Zapruder’s 8mm film of the Kennedy assassination?” Similarly, what professional photographs have you seen recently that moved you as much as the pictures in your parents’ photo album?\n\nIn direct contradiction to Ansel Adams’ famous quote about great images being made not taken, the most disarming photography being done today is being done by people who’ve never heard the term “f-stop.”\n\nSo where does that leave us? We have no idea. But we recently talked about all of this with the brilliant and talented photography duo, Sarah Barlow and Stephen Schofield. The conversation was interesting. This is something that’s been on their minds. Which makes sense since, despite being skilled professionals, their most recognizable work is the Polaroid shot from the cover of Taylor Swift’s most recent album, 1989 — a Polaroid that purposefully mimics something you might find in an old photo album, on a friend’s bulletin board, or even on Instagram. A photograph taken by a friend. Here are Sarah and Stephen.\n\nBlythe Thomas and Susannah Brittany\nA big thing I’m constantly learning is the emotion of photography. The biggest thing is the connection you have with the person.\n\nMusicbed: Are you guys in Nashville?\nSarah Barlow: No, we just relocated to L.A. It made more sense to live out here since we were flying out all the time. We’re in the middle of transitioning all of our business out here.\n\nDo you guys have enough water?\nStephen Schofield: We’re drinking a lot of coffee lately. Coffee and wine. Everyone juices out here, and I do too — but it’s wine. I feel like water is a common ingredient of the two.\n\nSB: Wine juice. We’re on the European juice diet. [laughs]\n\nSS: Where are you guys? Texas. Fort Worth.\n\nSS: No way! I did two years at TCU. It’s my dark past. [laughs]\n\nYou didn’t like TCU?\nSS: I loved TCU, but it was a time in my life when I’d veered off course because of family obligations and things people wanted me to do. I come from a real “traditional work” family with my parents being doctors and my relatives being lawyers. My mom and dad are very musical and creative, but I felt this pressure to do something traditional and keep art as a hobby. I went to TCU for finance. I wore French cuff shirts and pleated pants. It was a dark, dark time. I lost my identity in a Thomas Pink store.\n\nDid rebelling against that time drive you into art?\nSS: I’ve always done art, so I didn’t rebel too hard. It was more just realizing this wasn’t for me. It’s not the part of my brain and heart I operate from. My parents were actually super supportive and understanding. Over the years and accomplishments, they definitely see the value and are fully supportive.\n\nLOWFIELD Photography\nHow did you guys end up working together?\nSS: Long story short, we both ended up in Nashville. I transferred from TCU to Belmont University because finishing school was a nonnegotiable. So I was at Belmont, and Sarah had just moved here from Chicago. Basically we ended up at the same residential building in this urban development section in Nashville. Due to the building being relatively new and occupancy still low, everybody saw each other frequently. A mutual friend introduced me to Sarah, and then we kept seeing each other around the property, which naturally grew into a friendship. She lived in this baller penthouse overlooking the popular pool. I lived on a different level with the pariahs and the outcasts. My balcony overlooked a figurative mudhole — a secluded pool — and Sarah’s overlooked Swan Lake. [laughs]\n\nI was curious about what Sarah did, and I ended up learning more about her art and her wedding photography. When I saw it, I was like, “Man, there’s something very special here.” I told her, “You should probably do something in fashion or music — something beyond what you’re doing now.” And she was like, “I don’t know how to get into that.”\n\nI had some friends from different agencies in New York, so we put together a test shoot. The process turned out to be really fun, and at the end Sarah was like, “Hey, you’re good at what you do. I don’t know what it is, but you should be doing this.” I felt like Rick Rubin. I was like, “Yeah, sure, I don’t know what I’m supposed to do, but I definitely see a path to steer this creative effort!” In some weird way, a collaboration was taking shape.\n\nSB: I told him if he could find time and room outside of music, he should do art direction in New York. And he said, “Well, I think this collaboration we have going on is pretty cool. Do you want to keep doing this?” After a while it just took off. People started noticing what we were doing. I think they saw both of our personalities in it. Mine is more documentary, editorial, real life. Stephen has this fashion, dark-edge type of thing.\n\nSS: Our first official paid shoot together was Taylor Swift’s Red album.\n\n\nYou have to invest in people during a shoot, give out so they can let their guard down and fully interact and feel like their real selves.\n\n\n\nHow did you land that?\nSB: Taylor is a mutual friend of ours. Stephen and his brother were friends with her years before, and I became friends with her separately. What ended up happening was one of her background singers needed headshots. When Taylor saw them a few months later, she came to me and was like, “Liz showed me the shots you took of her, and I need my album to look exactly like that.” Clearly, this was a no-brainer. I said, “OK!” Before then, I’d been kind of burned out on music photography. A lot of the shoots were super controlling. I needed a new perspective on the field itself and wanted future shoots to be very free-flowing — just the artist and a minimum crew. Luckily for Stephen and me, that’s exactly how Taylor presented the Red album shoot. So it was just the three of us shooting everything together. She wanted everybody else to remain off set, allowing for a more personal and intimate experience.\n\nYou guys ended up doing the shoot for 1989 too, right?\nSB: Yup. It was like a Polaroid and digital mix. I think we ended up shooting — how many, Stephen? — 460 Polaroids? Something like that?\n\nSS: Yeah, something like that.\n\nSB: Insane amount of Polaroids.\n\nLOWFIELD Photography\nWhat’s the newest thing you guys have learned about photography?\nSB: A big thing I’m constantly learning is the emotion of photography. The biggest thing is the connection you have with the person. You have to invest in people during a shoot, give out so they can let their guard down and fully interact and feel like their real selves.\n\nSS: You have to show confidence. You have to put out good vibes and positive energy to create an environment that allows the subject to be completely disarmed, which allows you to get what no one else has been able to get. That’s the thing we’ve both learned and continue to learn. It’s about the energies you bring to a shoot. You can get real nerdy about all this techy stuff; but at the end of the day, someone who is able to connect relationship-wise with a subject is going to get a better shot. Beyond that, I’m always looking up stuff on Lynda.com about, like, how to use CS2 better.\n\nSB: CS2?! What are you talking about? That was like 15 years ago!\n\nSS: I guess that was a little flashback to the past. I was introduced to Lynda back in college, so I automatically went to CS2.\n\nSB: That’s our dark secret. We still work in CS2. [laughs]\n\nI think there’s something cool about creating an artificial, suspended reality where things look weird and cool.\n\n\n\nAre you the type of photographer who takes a billion frames and then edits later, or takes just a few frames?\nSB: I’m working on that. I think it depends on what you’re shooting. If you’re in the studio and the person isn’t moving around, then you can shoot slower. I’m a feeler-shooter though, so I move around a lot. We’re all interacting, so there is a lot of action and emotion going on. With that, you do have to shoot more. It’s an area I’m constantly working on though, because I’m trying to get in the zone of thinking I’m shooting on film, even when I’m shooting digital. With digital, it’s easy to shoot a ton. If I’m not careful, I can get into a spray-and-pray type of vibe. Ha.\n\nAnd you feel like that’s bad?\nSB: I think so. Just in terms of time on the back end, it takes a lot longer to edit. So for Stephen’s sanity, it’s better to shoot fewer images.\n\nDoes the world look better in real life or in photographs?\nSS: Photographs.\n\nSB: Real life! Oh, for sure.\n\nSS: Photographs.\n\n\n\nhear chelsea lankes on musicbed\nSB: Obviously, I’m totally into photography, but I wish photographs could capture the world as I see it, you know? There are so many times when I’m like, Ah, this would make such an amazing photograph, but a photograph is not going to be able to capture it exactly. A photograph can’t capture how you feel about something, the way it smells, you know?\n\nSS: I don’t know. I think photos can distort reality, and it’s kind of…it’s like a book. You’re able to escape the day-to-day mundanity of reality. I think there’s something cool about creating an artificial, suspended reality where things look weird and cool. That’s what works about movies and books and magazines. Like Steven Klein, his photos are super shimmery and the landscapes are almost otherworldly. You don’t know where they are and that immediately puts you in this whole new environment. I like that. I like the idea of creating your own world. I’ve always enjoyed dress up, so that might be a factor. [laughs]\n\nSB: Basically, Stephen is trying to escape this world.\n\nDo you guys have a favorite photograph?\nSB: My grandma recently died, and she had a bunch of photos of herself from when she was younger. She was one of my favorite people ever. And in some of these photos, she’s so cool and independent. There’s such a classic Polaroid look to the photos. They’re perfectly timeless. We strive to shoot like that today.\n\n\nSS: There’s a photo I keep coming back to that’s so amazing. There are a lot of different emotions in it. It was shot by Steven Meisel, and it’s with Tony Ward and Linda Evangelista. I think it was 1991 for Dolce & Gabbana. It’s somewhat violent but still retains its elegance, and it’s beautiful too. I remember when I first saw it, I was like, Whoa. It made me feel kind of weird, and I think that’s what I like about it. My reaction was something other than, Oh, pretty photo.\n\nLet’s say there could be a best photo ever taken. Is it on a professional photographer’s hard drive or is it buried in a family photo album somewhere?\nSB: I think it’s in somebody’s family photo album. There is something so real and authentic there. It’s where people let their guard down — the subject, but also the photographer. The person taking the picture is as comfortable as the person getting her picture taken. When I can feel that in a photo, it’s the best photo ever.\n\nSS: I don’t know. So many powerful images captured by professional photographers and photojournalists have impacted our culture. Like The Falling Man taken on 9/11. Richard Drew captured that. Or what was that other one? The Kiss of Life by Rocco Morabito. Two utility workers were working on a power line, and one of them got electrocuted. The other one gave him mouth-to-mouth and saved his life. That was a super powerful image. The photographer was nearby and able to capture the moment. So it definitely helps if you know what you’re doing with a camera.\n\nBlythe Thomas and Susannah Brittany\nThanks to Sarah and Stephen for taking the time to chat with us. It’s definitely got us thinking. Take some time this week to look through some old photo albums. See what those photographs do to you and how they might affect your work.",

It just flowed out, honestly. She’s so fast. And Taylor kind of knew — she came in with [sings] “You’re on the phone with your girlfriend…” And it just kind of flowed into that chorus.\n\nAre there individual strengths that you and Taylor have as co-songwriters, where you put your emphasis on one part and she does another?\nWe were always back-and-forth. She comes in with the story and the melody — I truly believe that she heard the production in that song while we wrote it. And that song always amazes me, because when I do writers’ night and I try to play it, I always make the audience sing it — or I make girls get up to sing it.\n\nAnd that chorus — it’s impossible to sing! I don’t know how she did it. Well, I mean, she’s young and she has a great voice. But the high-reaching [parts of the chorus]… usually I just stop and let the audience sing it. I’m like, “Y’all take this, I can’t do it!”\n\nWas there a part of the chorus that once it came together, you guys knew you were good to go?\nOh, man, just the way it flowed so fast. And I loved the way that it was [only] half of the chorus the first time — have you noticed that? I just think that was so cool, the way we did that.\n\nIt does seem like something you guys did a number of times together — where the chorus does shift as the song goes on, and by the third chorus, there’s a key word or phrase that gets turned on its head a little. What do you think the power of doing that is?\nIt makes you want to stay until the end of the song. And I think that it makes a song more personal. It does it in [Fearless single] “White Horse,” and it does it in “You Belong With Me.” It just makes the listener feel like the writer and the artist care about the song — that they’re like, “Okay, you’ve heard it, but wait a minute — ‘cause I want you know that this really affected me, I’m gonna dig the knife in just a little bit deeper.” We were never through writing a song until we were through writing a song. Until the last line.\n\nI noticed listening to the song recently that it almost sounds like a ‘90s rock song, the way the verses explode into the chorus. Was that something you guys were intentionally going for, or just how it came together?\nI think it was there when we were writing it. We wrote it, like, the day before she cut it. And she, I believe, wanted to make sure she’d written everything she could write for the record before she finished cutting it. So I think she came in wanting to write an up-tempo [number], and came in with that story, wanting to write this really fun, fast, driving song. And you can hear it in the guitar, in the work tape.\n\nDo you think this is the best chorus you and Taylor ever did together?\nAbsolutely. When I go out and do it — when I don’t even have to sing it [Laughs] — it’s pretty awesome! There’s a lot of joy in it. It’s really fun to do live, it’s really fun to watch young girls to 50-year-old women get up and sing it.\n\nDo you have a favorite chorus of the 21st century, or a song that comes to mind when think of a great 21st-century chorus?\nOh, gosh. Well “Girl Crush,” of course. [Laughs.] But that I didn’t write? Taylor’s song “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.” I mean, that song is amazing. And [Florida Georgia Line‘s] “Cruise.” Think about what “Cruise” did, with FGL. Just that it makes you want to sing it, whether you’re a fan of theirs or not, it doesn’t matter. That song, it had a big impact on country music. And “Mama’s Broken Heart,” Miranda [Lambert], that Kacey [Musgraves] wrote. There’s some great ones.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Emily Poe Stumler’s Turning Point came when she put down her fiddle and picked up her law degree.\n\n\nShe seemed to be headed toward a career in music. She had started taking violin lessons at age 6. She was class president and a cheerleader at Floyd Central High School in Indiana, and she played violin in the school orchestra. She attended Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue her music career. Then, in her senior year, she auditioned to be a fiddle player for Taylor Swift.\n\n“No one knew her then. She was only 16. I traveled on the bus with Taylor and her mother, and the rest of the crew — all men — were on another bus. We went all over the U.S. and Canada. That was the summer of 2006. We would sometimes be gone from Wednesday to Sunday. It was a great experience. I got to see places that I might never have traveled to. But, that life is not as glamourous as one might think.”\n\nFor her first performance, Emily played the fiddle in the auditorium of Corydon Live Music and Entertainment. Photos by Patti Hartog\nEmily wanted to pursue music as far as it would take her but, she says, she always had it on her radar to go to law school. “I also knew I wanted a husband and children. I toured with Taylor for about two years and eventually left, took the LSAT, and entered law school at University of Tennessee in Knoxville.”\n\nShe was in her third year of law school when Eli Stumler, her husband-to-be, was discharged from the Army and moved back home. “We had been good friends in high school. We even went to senior prom together and after graduation, when we were home at the same time, we would meet for dinner. That friendship turned into more. Two thousand eleven was a big year for me. I became engaged in February, graduated law school in May, took the bar in July, and Eli and I were married in November.”\n\nEmily worked for a real estate attorney for a couple of years and had a part-time job at the prosecuting attorney’s office for Harrison County, Indiana. That turned into a full-time job. Now, at age 32, she is chief deputy prosecutor with the office that represents the State of Indiana in all criminal matters in Harrison County.\n\n“I see cases from driving under the influence to juvenile crimes to murder. I prosecute all the sex crimes. I spend the majority of my day in the courtroom. I love being in the courtroom preparing for trial. Some days are more disheartening than others. It’s hard not to internalize some of what I see and hear, but at the end of the day I feel that we are doing good. I never really considered going into criminal law, but now I can’t imagine doing anything else.”\n\nShe hasn’t put down her music either. Emily still plays her violin at weddings and special events.\n\n“When I turn around and look back at my life, my path is much clearer now than when I was on it. I can see now how studying music formed my work ethic — continuing to strive to get better was so helpful. You don’t realize in school that it molds you into the person that you are.”\n\nBy April Allman|August 7, 2017|Turning Point",

Now Taylor Swift is among them. “To me, Tom Petty represented a kind of songwriting I idolized: complex simplicity,” she said to Rolling Stone. \n\n“It said so much in the lyrics, the concepts, the stories, the message, the nuances … but always brought you back to a hook that got stuck in everyone’s head. He motivated thousands of guitarists to learn to play just because they wanted to be able to play ‘Free Fallin.” Count me as one of them.”\n\nIn 2009, Swift covered and recorded Petty’s “American Girl” during her Fearless tour. Three years and two albums later on 2012’s Red, Swift began to shed her more youthful approach in favor of more empowering themes, embodying the very kind of country-to-pop crossover that Petty paved the way for.",

      "Transcript/Content": "❗TRIGGER WARNING: DISCUSSION OF SA❗\n\n‘I Was Angry.’ Taylor Swift on What Powered Her Sexual Assault Testimony\n6 MINUTE READ\nBY ELIANA DOCKTERMAN\nDECEMBER 6, 2017 6:10 AM EST\nTaylor Swift, photographed Nov. 2017. Billy & Hells for TIME\n\nBefore the Harvey Weinstein allegations broke, and before #MeToo swept the Internet, Taylor Swift testified in court on Aug. 10 about being assaulted in a room full of people. Swift, who TIME recognized as one of the Silence Breakers who inspired women to speak out about harassment in this year’s Person of the Year issue, granted TIME her first interview since the trial.\n\nIn 2013, the singer-songwriter took a photo with a Colorado radio DJ after an interview. During that photo, Swift says, DJ David Mueller reached under her skirt and grabbed her rear end. Swift privately reported the incident to the station at which Mueller worked, and he was fired. Mueller then sued Swift for defamation; she countersued for a symbolic $1—and won.\n\nSwift refused to be bullied on the stand. Her straightforward testimony was lauded by many for its fierceness. When asked why the pictures taken during the assault didn’t show the front of her skirt wrinkled as evidence of any wrongdoing, she said simply, “Because my ass is located at the back of my body.” When asked if she felt guilty about Mueller losing his job, she said, “I’m not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault. Here we are years later, and I’m being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are the product of his decisions—not mine.”\n\nLike many of the women interviewed for the 2017 Person of the Year issue, Swift would not accept blame for the abuse she experienced. Her clear-eyed testimony marked one of several major milestones in the conversation around sexual harassment this year. Swift responded to questions about her experience from TIME in writing.\n\nWhy was it important for you to come forward about what happened to you?\n\nIn 2013, I met a DJ from a prominent country radio station in one of my pre-show meet and greets. When we were posing for the photo, he stuck his hand up my dress and grabbed onto my ass cheek. I squirmed and lurched sideways to get away from him, but he wouldn’t let go. At the time, I was headlining a major arena tour and there were a number of people in the room that saw this plus a photo of it happening. I figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances and high stakes, imagine what he might do to a vulnerable, young artist if given the chance. It was important to report the incident to his radio station because I felt like they needed to know. The radio station conducted its own investigation and fired him. Two years later, he sued me.\n\nHow did you feel when you testified?\n\nWhen I testified, I had already been in court all week and had to watch this man’s attorney bully, badger and harass my team including my mother over inane details and ridiculous minutiae, accusing them, and me, of lying. My mom was so upset after her cross-examination, she was physically too ill to come to court the day I was on the stand. I was angry. In that moment, I decided to forego any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened. This man hadn’t considered any formalities when he assaulted me, and his lawyer didn’t hold back on my mom—why should I be polite? I’m told it was the most amount of times the word “ass” has ever been said in Colorado Federal Court.\n\nWatch: Why the Silence Breakers Are the 2017 Person of the Year\n\nHow have people responded to your story?\n\nPeople have been largely very supportive of my story since the trial began in August, but before that, I spent two years reading headlines referring to it as “The Taylor Swift Butt Grab Case” with internet trolls making a joke about what happened to me. The details were all skewed, as they often are. Most people thought I was suing him. There was an audible gasp in the courtroom when I was named as the defendant. Once it hit the news that I was in Denver dealing with this, there was an outpouring of support on social media and I have never appreciated it more. I spoke to Kesha on the phone and it really helped to talk to someone who had been through the demoralizing court process.\n\nAfter this experience, what advice would you give to your fans?\n\nI would tell people who find themselves in this situation that there is a great deal of blame placed on the victims in cases of sexual harassment and assault. You could be blamed for the fact that it happened, for reporting it and blamed for how you reacted. You might be made to feel like you’re overreacting, because society has made this stuff seem so casual. My advice is that you not blame yourself and do not accept the blame others will try to place on you. You should not be blamed for waiting 15 minutes or 15 days or 15 years to report sexual assault or harassment, or for the outcome of what happens to a person after he or she makes the choice to sexually harass or assault you.\n\nIs this a watershed moment for the way we think about sexual assault and harassment in culture?\n\nI think that this moment is important for awareness, for how parents are talking to their children, and how victims are processing their trauma, whether it be new or old. The brave women and men who have come forward this year have all moved the needle in terms of letting people know that this abuse of power shouldn’t be tolerated. Going to court to confront this type of behavior is a lonely and draining experience, even when you win, even when you have the financial ability to defend yourself. Even though awareness is higher than ever about workplace sexual harassment, there are still so many people who feel victimized, afraid and silenced by their abusers and circumstances. When the jury found in my favor, the man who sexually assaulted me was court-ordered to give me a symbolic $1. To this day he has not paid me that dollar, and I think that act of defiance is symbolic in itself.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Excerpt] Jack Antonoff on his jam-packed 2017 and the Taylor Swift song he calls a 'hint at the future'\nThe Bleachers mastermind produced for Lorde, Pink, St. Vincent, and Taylor Swift this year\n\nBy Nolan Feeney  Published on December 28, 2017 11:47AM EST\n\nWhat were the reputation sessions like? When I listen to “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things,” I imagine you guys having a blast in the studio. But other songs, like “Call It What You Want To,” make me want to see if Taylor needs a hug.\nIt’s an intense album, and that’s what I care about. In the course of a day — in the course of two minutes — you can feel like you can conquer the world, or you can feel like the biggest piece of garbage that ever existed. An album or song should feel that way too. It should have the whole gamut of what it actually is like for the artist to be alive at that moment. The sessions were just her and I. She would come over to my apartment, and we would talk and eat and talk more, and the things we talked about turned into songs. She is great at remembering the heart and soul of the process. Some people forget it — sometimes something works and everyone starts to rewire it. But she’s really great at knowing what it’s about: talking about what the hell is going on in your life and somehow finding a way to take that exact emotion and make a song out of it. That was the theme of those sessions: “Let’s just tell this story, whatever that story is, because that’s the whole point.”\n\nWould you start from scratch or would she show up with ideas and demos?\n1989 was different. I would send her tracks, and she would write to that. We did reputation sitting in the room together. There were lyric ideas or things like that [that she would bring], but I would say the majority of it came from scratch. Things would just happen in the room. It was a special time.\n\nThe last song on the album, “New Year’s Day,” doesn’t sound like anything else on the record. Was there ever a conversation about taking this stripped-down song and building it up into something more in line with the rest of the album?\nNo, no, no. Not only that, but it was the quickest [song to record]. If you listen to the piano on that record, you can hear me moving around. You hear things clicking. Those are the “scratch takes” — we did that very quickly. It came out in that sort of goofy Hollywood version of how music is written, where it comes out of moments of inspiration. Part of the process is you do that [scratch take], and then you do it for real. But we just sat there: That’s the song. You want a song to sound like itself. You don’t want to get the perfect tune. You don’t want to get the absolute perfect vocal take or the perfect panning or compression. You just want it to sound like itself. You want to feel like you’re home within the song. That theory works for “Closer” by Nine Inch Nails, and that theory works for Joni Mitchell. It has nothing to do with genre, or how loud or soft it is. You just want the song to feel like itself. I don’t know what we would be thinking if we tried to f— with it. I’m so proud of it because, personally, I think it’s some sort of hint at the future.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift surprises fans, shoots whiskey, relives 'love story' at Bluebird Cafe\nCINDY WATTS   | The Tennessean\n\nTaylor Swift may be a global pop icon these days, but the Nashville resident hasn't abandoned her country roots. \n\nAbout 40 patrons settled in for an Easter eve concert at Bluebird Cafe Saturday night. Prolific country songwriter Craig Wiseman topped the bill, but it was an unannounced appearance from Swift that stole the show.\n\nWiseman, who met Swift at a charity show when she was a teenager, was in on the surprise and welcomed Swift to join him. She received a standing ovation.\n\n\"I wanted to say a big thank you to the Bluebird Cafe,\" Swift said, perching on a stool beside Wiseman. \"I think any songwriter in town would echo my sentiments and say that this is kind of the only place where this exists -- this particular place where you get to come and hear the writer's take on the songs they've put out into the world.\"\n\nSwift started writing songs in Nashville when she convinced her family to move to Music City when she was 14 years old. The singer, now 28, said she learned a lot about writing songs in Nashville, but one of her earliest lessons was that all a song needed was three chords and a simple concept.\n\n\"If there's truth in it, don't over think it,\" she said. \"It can be the same three chords over and over again.\"\n\nThe best and possibly catchiest example of Music City's three chords and the truth in her catalog, Swift said, is her  \"Shake It Off.\" Wearing a black turtleneck and her blond hair pulled into a ponytail, Swift strapped on a black acoustic guitar and launched into the pop song with a fervor reminiscent of an arena show.\n\nHowever, Swift's superstar status didn't excuse her from a good-natured stroll down memory lane with Wiseman. The songwriter, famous for penning songs including Tim McGraw's \"Live Like You Were Dying\" and Kenny Chesney's \"Young,\" recalled a CMT afterparty at his office that had Swift complaining of a headache the next day. Wiseman is a key player in the career of Florida Georgia Line. The duo name-dropped Fireball Whisky in its song \"'Round Here,\" and the whiskey company supplied Wiseman's publishing house with a surplus of their product. When Swift showed up at Wiseman's CMT afterparty, he showed her the bar, the deejay and the wine. But, what she really wanted was access to the Fireball Whisky shot room. \n\n\"I got her a shot of Fireball, and then I got her another one,\" Wiseman recalled, explaining that Swift retreated to a balcony in a VIP area. \"For the rest of the party, I would go get a shot of Fireball ... and snake my hand through the people (on this balcony) in her general direction. I don't even know if she took it, but it disappeared.\"\n\nSwift laughed that the whiskey wasn't all that disappeared. She said that she and friend Ed Sheeran stole Wiseman's large, inflatable bottle of Fireball that was standing in the corner.\n\n\"I was going to take it home!\" Wiseman gasped as the crowd laughed. \n\nThe songwriter pulled a silver, insulated mug out of a gift bag near his seat. He popped the lid and unpacked several tiny bottles of Fireball. \n\n\"For old-times sake,\" Wiseman said.\n\n\"Should we play another song?\" Swift asked the crowd, strumming her guitar. \"Did you want to hear music tonight or did you want to hear about CMT afterparties?\"\n\n\"I'll tend the bar,\" Wiseman quipped. \"I'll be ready for you.\"\n\nSwift turned her attention back to the Bluebird Cafe. Until recently, no one had charted a hit with a song Swift had written alone but herself.  Last year Little Big Town nabbed a No. 1 country hit with the Swift-penned \"Better Man.\" The song went on to win Song of the Year from the Country Music Association and a Grammy Award. Swift savored the opportunity to sing \"Better Man\" for the crowd.\n\n\"When I would play writers nights ... I didn't have the experience of a writer writing something and then it going out into the world and you earing it from someone else's perspective until recently,\" Swift said, referring to \"Better Man.\"  \"Little Big Town gave me the opportunity to feel that way ... to be at the Bluebird and play a song you've maybe heard on the radio.  I will always be forever grateful to them for that.\"\n\nAfter the song, she and Wiseman did shots of Fireball straight out of the tiny bottles. Wiseman wore bunny ears.\n\n\"I'm literally watching you, and I'm just going to do what you do,\" Swift told Wiseman. \"I'm going to look you in the eye the whole time.\"\n\nSwift tentatively tipped the tiny bottle back, then fully committed when she realized Wiseman wasn't putting his drink down.\n\nWhen they finished, Wiseman took the empty bottle from Swift and said he was going to sell it and donate the money to charity. \n\nWhile it seemed the joke was on Swift, she repaid the veteran songwriter -- reminding him that he passed up the opportunity to co-write one of her biggest hits. She was 17 years old when she and Wiseman had their first co-writing session, and Swift wanted to make sure she was prepared. She brought him a couple of verses and a chorus of a song she'd been working on and a few backup ideas. She played him the song, and Wiseman said he didn't get it. They wrote a different song, but Swift went home and finished writing her original idea. \n\n\"I couldn't stop thinking about the idea,\" Swift told the audience. \"I thought there was something to it. I really liked it.\"\n\nAs she told the story, Wiseman looked embarrassed and repeatedly shook his head. \n\n\"This is the song I almost wrote with Craig Wiseman,\" she said. \"It's called 'Love Story.'\"\n\nSwift's performance was filmed for a documentary in honor of Bluebird Cafe's 35th anniversary. The cafe is in the midst of a year-long celebration of the milestone and Swift's appearance will surely be a highlight.  The Bluebird Cafe is particularly sentimental for Swift — Big Machine Label Group's Scott Borchetta saw Swift play the room when she was an 8th grader and offered her a record deal.\n\nSwift launched her career from Nashville as a teenager in 2006 with her song \"Tim McGraw.\" She charted follow-up country hits including  \"Our Song,\" \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" before shifting her creative focus to pop music in 2014 with her album \"!989.\" Driven by the lead single \"Shake it Off,\" the album sold nearly 1.3 million copies its first week in stores to make it the largest sales week for an album since 2002.\n\nSwift released her second pop album \"Reputation\" in November. These days Swift's country performances are almost as rare as her club shows. The singer's Reputation Stadium Tour will launch in May and will visit Nashville's Nissan Stadium Aug. 25. Tickets are available now through Ticketmaster.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Nick Buda: Getting Into Music and Making it Work \nBerklee Blog Banne\nRecently, I had the pleasure of interviewing Nick Buda for Berklee College of Music's alumni blog. \nThe following is a re-posting of the blog on Berklee Blogs.\n \n\nLAB: Getting Into Music and Making it Work\nBerklee Alumni Spotlight: Nick Buda ’96\n\nNick Buda (’96) started playing drums on his mom’s couch cushion when he was a kid in Cape Town, South Africa. As early as ten years old, he was begging her to take lessons.\n\n“I got my first set of practice pads when I was 13 and my family moved to Nashville to escape apartheid in South Africa,” said Nick. “I used to play along with bands like Living Color and James Taylor with my electric drums for hours everyday. I was 14 when I got my first drum kit.”\n\nIt was in high school that he began cutting his teeth as a performer in several rock bands.\n\n“In 9th grade I was in an indie rock band and we snuck into a studio through a window after hours to record our first EP; one of the songs even had a swear word in it,” Nick laughs. “I played in a few local bands in high school and I knew it was what I wanted to do.”\n\nNick was already considering Berklee when he met Vinnie Colaiuta (drummer for Sting, Beck, Joni Mitchell and many others).\n\n“Sting was playing at Starwood Amphitheatre in Nashville and I was friends with a music journalist that got me backstage at the concert,” said Nick. “I got to meet Vinnie and he brought up the subject of Berklee. Because he was one of my key musical influences, that was deciding factor in going.”\n\nActually attending Berklee was a ‘huge eye-opener’ for Nick.\n\n“Three days after I got there I was in the dorms on Commonwealth Ave. and there was a common area where students would jam,” he said. “I was not a jazz guy, but I learned quickly that I needed to get into whatever style of music I needed to, even if I wasn’t the best at it, so I could make it work.”\n\nNick credits Berklee for his first experiences in studio work, expanding musical foundation and ear training.\n\n“Working in the studio with other students made me much more aware as a musician and helped me gain studio experience in the safety of school,” he said. “Ear training was valuable for me, it helped me learn how to chart songs.”\n\nAfter graduating with a bachelor’s degree with a focus on percussion performance Nick returned to Nashville. After two years, he heard about a touring position with Colonel Bruce Hampton through a Berklee connection.\n\n“I toured with Bruce two years and it was a real-life road education,” said Nick. “Bruce was really quirky and he had a cult-like following. Shows were about ‘go to war’, and it was two hours or more of heavy-hitting hard work every night.”\n\nAfter touring with Bruce, Nick took road gigs with country singers Cindy Thompson and Aaron Lines, acts that were opening for Alan Jackson and Brooks and Dunn. He also toured for about a year with Mindy Smith and spent time on the road with Edwin McCain.\n\n“I was getting tired of being out on the road at that point so I started to look into session work,” said Nick. “I also found out that session players who played on artists’ records were often first-call drummers for bigger road gigs.”\n\nIt took Nick awhile to break into the studio scene in Nashville.\n\n“You may know a lot of people and be friends with a lot of big writers, but these people usually always have their group of players they work with,” he said. “It takes time to build a reputation and client list as a session drummer.”\n\nNick met and became friends with producer Nathan Chapman, and he started calling Nick to play on demos.\n\n“Nathan is a workaholic, and we had a small band that did two demos a week,” said Nick. “Nathan was playing guitar, Tim Marks was playing bass and Chad Carlson was engineering in the sessions. We were all starting from the same place as session players and it was cool for all of us to come up together.”\n\nAfter about a year, Liz Rose asked them to record a demo for a song that she had written with Taylor Swift.\n\n“Taylor really liked the vibe and the sound we were getting on the demo,” said Nick. “At 15 years old, she went into the head of the label and said she wanted to record the songs with a bunch of unknown session players. That took a lot of courage.”\n\nTaylor struck a deal with the Scott Brochetta to allow Nathan to record two or three songs with the crew that had played on all of his demos.\n\n“Really it’s unheard of in Nashville,” Nick said. “You never hear of an unknown artist choosing unknown producers and players for a debut record. But, there was something to be said about our chemistry. We were all hungry and it was fresh and new. That was true for Taylor too.”\n\nIn addition to playing on all of Taylor’s albums since then, Nick has recorded with such diverse artists and producers as Richard Marx, Jewel, Jeffery Steele, Jimmy Wayne, Hillary Lindsey and many, many more.\n\n“I love commercial music, and the trick is to keep it creative while trying to stay within the lines in Nashville,” said Nick. “I like to keep it interesting.”\n\nSo what’s next for Nick?\n\n“I still love playing drums, and even on a bad day I still get to playing them,” he said. “I get to play on stuff that’s on the radio and to be in that circle of some of the world’s greatest players is extremely flattering. I’m looking forward to seeing whatever’s ahead for me, but the bottom line is it’s still all about making great music.”\n\nFor more information about Nick, visit his website at www.nickbuda.com.",

      "Transcript/Content": "In the 1960s and ’70s, Pattie Boyd stood at the intersection of fashion, rock ’n’ roll, art, and fame. Widely considered one of the greatest muses of all time, Boyd, who was married first to George Harrison and later to Eric Clapton, inspired the hits “Something” by the Beatles, and “Layla” and “Wonderful Tonight” by Clapton. Recently I devoured this intriguing woman’s memoir, Wonderful Tonight. A few weeks later, I had the pleasure of sitting down with her in the kitchen of her beautiful Kensington flat. As the sunlight poured through the windows, her blue eyes lit up as she spoke. There is a playful quality about her and, surprisingly—considering how much she has experienced in her life—a lightness.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: I have been so excited to talk to you because we’re both women whose lives have been deeply influenced by songs and songwriting. I stand on one side of it, and you on the other. Does the concept of being called a muse feel like a correct fit?\n\nPATTIE BOYD: I find the concept of being a muse understandable when you think of all the great painters, poets, and photographers who usually have had one or two. The artist absorbs an element from their muse that has nothing to do with words, just the purity of their essence.\n\nTS: What do you feel might be a factor that artists want to communicate with you through song?\n\nPB: I think in my case both George and Eric had an inability to communicate their feelings through normal conversation. I became a reflection for them.\n\nTS: I wondered who and what situation “Wonderful Tonight” was written about, and now I know it’s about you getting ready for a party, changing clothes, and saying, “I don’t like this, I don’t like that.”\n\nPB: I came downstairs with trepidation thinking [Eric] was going to be so angry that I’d taken far too long, and instead he said, “Listen, I’ve just written this song.”\n\nTS: That is so incredible to me.\n\nPB: But you must do that too. You must be inspired by a few moments or something, the way your boyfriend turns or says something to you or a little bit of a smile or “Is he thinking this or that?,” and that would inspire you. Can you write it the moment it’s happening?\n\nTS: There are definitely moments when it’s like this cloud of an idea comes and just lands in front of your face, and you reach up and grab it. A lot of songwriting is things you learn, structure, and cultivating that skill, and knowing how to craft a song. But there are mystical, magical moments, inexplicable moments when an idea that is fully formed just pops into your head. And that’s the purest part of my job. It can get complicated on every other level, but the songwriting is still the same uncomplicated process it was when I was 12 years old writing songs in my room.\n\nPB: Right, right…\n\nTS: I don’t know what it is that makes some people really creatively inspiring. There have been people I’ve spent a lot of time with who I just couldn’t write about.\n\nPB: Yes, now what is that?\n\nTS: I don’t know. It’s just that some people come into your life and they have this effect on you. It’s really interesting because in your case you inspired that creative output from two iconic musicians. That just blows my mind. It’s very rare!\n\nPB: Well, the more you say it to me, the more it’s blowing my mind.\n\nTS: You met George Harrison at 19 on the set of A Hard Day’s Night. All of a sudden your life was changed forever because you fell in love with someone who the world was obsessed with. There was no band as big as the Beatles. Did anyone prepare you for the attention?\n\nPB: No. Nobody took on that role. Nobody thought that role would be significant for a start. I remember a journalist coming to our house one day and saying to George, “In all seriousness, when do you think the bubble is going to burst? When are the Beatles going to be finished?”\n\nTS: Wow.\n\nPB: If they thought that, there’s no reason anyone would think, “Ah, I’ll look after Pattie and guide her through what is going to be a tremendously difficult situation for a young girl to cope with.” The only thing Brian Epstein, their manager, told me and the other wives and girlfriends was, “Don’t talk to the press.”\n\nTS: Were the fans the reason you decided to live in the country?\n\nPB: Living in London with George, there were so many fans every day, it became impossible to leave the flat. Brian Epstein thought there might be an idea that John, Ringo, and George move to the country, have little houses about an hour out of London. We would decorate the outside of our house with spray-paint cans. The whole house was like a psychedelic monster.\n\nTS: I remember seeing a picture of the house, and Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull had spray-painted their names on the wall with the words mick and marianne were here. I read a book about Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor recently, and how there was this crazy frenzy surrounding them. In the book, Elizabeth is quoted as saying, “It could be worse, we could be the Beatles.” You are one of the only people who can say they experienced what Beatlemania was like from the inside. How did that feel for you?\n\nPB: In my first experience, I found it absolutely terrifying. I got to see the Beatles play at a theater in London, and George told me that I should leave with my friends before the last number. So before the last song, we got up from our seats and walked toward the nearest exit door, and there were these girls behind me. They followed us out, and they were kicking me and pulling my hair and pushing us all the way down this long passageway.\n\nTS: What were they saying?\n\nPB: “We hate you.”\n\nTS: That is my worst nightmare. You probably felt like, “If you knew me and I knew you, you would not be pulling my hair in an alleyway and saying, ‘I hate you.’”\n\nPB: Exactly.\n\nTS: Has the dynamic changed with Beatles fans now that you put on these incredible exhibitions of your photographs?\n\nPB: George is no longer with us, or John. It was such a long time ago, and the fans haven’t held on to the same antagonistic feelings toward me. Actually they seem happy that I’m sharing the photographs I took. One time I was having an exhibition, and these girls turned up dressed like me in A Hard Day’s Night.\n\nTS: It’s so cute when people do that. I love that.\n\nPB: It is adorable.\n\nTS: That is amazing that you could go from a place of feeling incredibly frightened by the idea of this attention from people who loved the Beatles, and now there is just a huge amount of gratitude from them. For me, one of the most heartbreaking moments in the book is when, years later, you and Eric get married, and George and his new wife, Olivia, come to the wedding party, Paul comes, Ringo comes, but John couldn’t go. He said later that he would have loved to come. That night there was a huge jam session, and had he been there it would have been the last time the Beatles played together.\n\nPB: Can you imagine? I was heartbroken.\n\nTS: My heart was pierced by that.\n\nPB: John felt he couldn’t come because he thought if he left America they wouldn’t let him back in, and it was important for him to be in America.\n\nTS: I found it staggeringly beautiful in the book how you had been through many ups and downs, and told these stunning truths about your relationships, but everyone seems to be on really good terms. I mean, Eric even gave you permission to publish his love letters. What did it take for you to arrive at such a place of goodwill with people you’ve been through so much with? Is that just time passing?\n\nPB: I think time must play a big part. Because it all broke up for whatever reason, there is no need to carry on some sort of hate or dislike for this person. And then with time I thought, “I’ll just call on Eric and see if he’ll let me use these wonderful letters that he wrote, and if he needs anything from me, he just needs to call me, same thing, and I would say ‘yes’ to him.” I think this is all based on my memories of how it was when we were first married and what fun we had, the love that we’d enjoyed together as well.\n\nTS: It sounds like you take ownership of the past, and not just the good parts.\n\nPB: I do. Absolutely.\n\nTS: Lastly, what advice would you give a 28-year-old who’s deeply inspired by your outlook? I would love to look back on my life with the same clarity, wisdom, and peace that you seem to have.\n\nPB: You have to remember that nothing remains the same. It’s always going to change. The whole world keeps changing, we keep changing, things in our lives keep changing. Nothing remains the same. If you’re happy or you’re sad, it’s not going to last forever. You just have to keep remembering that.\n\nThis article originally appears in the August 2018 issue of Harper's BAZAAR, available on newsstands July 24.",

      "Transcript/Content": "She’s the biggest pop star in the world – beloved by millions but not above the occasional controversy. As Taylor Swift prepares to touchdown in Croke Park, Ed Power looks at her incredible rise to global superstardom, how she’s managed to stay on top, and talks to those who’ve been present during her remarkable journey, including Dublin producer Jacknife Lee.\n\nOne of the most important conversations in Taylor Swift’s life took place in Burbank, California in early 2014. Swift was at the headquarters of her record label, Big Machine, for a playback of her next album, provisionally titled 1989.\n\nPart-inspired by Swift’s relocation to New York from Nashville, her home for the previous decade and cradle of her career, the LP was a departure from the singer’s girl-next-door country rock. The palette was pop, the tone wistful and wondering. As the final song faded, Scott Borchetta, the label boss who had overseen Swift’s ascent from country radio obscurity to global fame pressed stop and tried not to grimace.\n\n“This is extraordinary – it’s the best album you’ve ever done,” he told her. “Can you just give me three country songs?”\n\nShe looked him in the eye and didn’t blink. “Love you, mean it,” said Swift. “But this is how it’s going to be.” Borchetta knew better than to argue the case.\n\nSwift was just 24 – 1989 was named for the year of her birth – but already a veteran, one who had reshaped glossy Nashville music in her image. Unlike Borchetta she also had a sense that, having achieved success in a lucrative yet essentially marginal genre, it was time to move on. She was very publicly growing up. Writing about having your heart broken on prom night – a lament inevitably accompanied by twanging guitars – was no longer a comfortable fit.\n\nThe incident speaks not only to Swift’s uncommon levels of prepossession, but also her canniness in negotiating her celebrity. Dealing with fame in your teens and early twenties can be torturous. And yet Swift emerged from adolescent stardom not only unscathed, but with a heightened sense of where she needed to go to take her career to the next level.\n\nSo it has continued ever since. After the bright-eyed wonderment of 1989, she retuned last summer with the darker, self-questioning Reputation – an interrogation of mega-fame and the compromises it has forced upon her. She is about to take the record on the road, with a tour that includes two highly anticipated dates at Croke Park in mid-June. The concerts will see her follow in the footsteps of U2 and Springsteen – confirming her promotion to popular music’s highest table.\n\n_image3_\n\n“It’s no small feat, and I know that,” she has said, speaking of the challenge of playing venues on the scale of the Dublin northside bowl. “When you walk out onstage in front of 65,000 people, it can bring you to tears. If you really take it in at the end of a song and you hear that many people screaming, it will make you cry.”\n\nSwift is, as with all the most interesting pop stars, a jumble of contradictions. Her Lisa Simpson image would seem to be grounded in a genuine belief in living cleanly and simply. However, she has also demonstrated considerable wiliness through her career and, as with Michael Jackson, combines a meek off-stage persona with a flair for superlatively caustic lyrics.\n\nThat was most forcefully demonstrated on 1989 stand-out ‘Bad Blood’ – a throwing down of the gauntlet against fellow pop A-lister Katy Perry, after the two clashed over the availability of backing dancers. Swift can forgive rubbish boyfriends and shattered dreams – but don’t stand between her and her touring schedule.\n\nAnd Perry can consider she got off lightly compared to the subject of ‘Mean’ from 2010’s Speak Now. “You can take me down / With just one single blow,” Swift sings. “But you don’t know what you don’t know / Someday I’ll be living in a big old city / And all you’re ever gonna be is mean.” (The song is generally considered to be a shot at Bob Lefsetz, an LA entertainment lawyer turned music blogger. He was a prominent critic of Swift’s singing style.)\n\nAdvertisement\n“She did something so horrible,” Swift told Rolling Stone when asked about ‘Bad Blood’, though she declined to name the subject of the song (it was Perry who in the end went public with the feud).\n\n“I was like, ‘Oh, we’re just straight-up enemies.’ And it wasn’t even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I’m surprisingly non-confrontational – you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It’s awkward, and I don’t like it.”\n\nThose who have worked with Taylor say that one factor in her success has been her parents. Early in her career, Swift was presented as a rags to riches performer – a girl who grew up on a Pennsylvania Christmas tree farm and upped sticks aged 12 to knock on doors in Nashville.\n\nThat’s true, in so far as it goes – but the Christmas tree farm was purchased by her father Scott, a mutual funds manager, from a client, and the family moved to Tennessee only after he secured a transfer to the Nashville offices of Merrill Lynch. And her mother Andrea has been her stalwart advisor, unofficial manager and image shaper – going on the road with her daughter and selecting mega-fans to meet their idol backstage.\n\n“Her parents had a lot of money. That kind of helps!” says Chuck Ainlay, the veteran Nashville producer and engineer who worked with Swift on her first three albums. “They put her in that place and gave her the confidence to move into the business the way she did.”\n\n_image5_\n\n“Her dad… is very, very ambitious,” agrees Dublin producer Garret “Jacknife” Lee, who had a songwriting session with Swift at his home studio in Topanga, Los Angeles. “Goal oriented. Businessman to the marrow. The first thing he asked me was if I drove to the venue, and if I did did I own stock in Mobil. I said I didn’t.\n\nAdvertisement\n“He then asked if I brushed my teeth and if I did, did I own Colgate. I said I didn’t and he said ‘You’re an idiot’. He’s behind her. Knows money and what it means. He’s a go-getter. The mom is the family face, and makes sure everyone is having a great time – that the fans get treated well. Taylor is a product of both; she’s thoughtful and savvy with money. Own your own stuff.”\n\nLee was introduced to Swift via Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol, another Irish transplant to Los Angeles, and a long-time collaborator of the Dubliner.\n\n“We met through Gary’s friendship with Ed Sheeran,” he recalls. “Taylor was a fan of Ed’s. They were on tour I think. Taylor came to Topanga. Body guards, big black car. We wrote a song in a couple of hours and sang it sitting on the sofa. She had a handheld microphone. Then we had pasta for dinner and hung around with my kids.\n\n“She left and I finished the song off. Owen Pallett [Arcade Fire/Final Fantasy] did some strings very quickly. Went to see her live a couple of times with my daughters who were fans of hers then. Now they like Snail Mail and Tyler the Creator.\n\n“It was out of my field of expertise and interest, but I was intrigued and my girls were thrilled. Taylor was nice and very professional. She knew what she wanted and there was no fucking about. She was seeing Harry Styles at the time, so he came to Topanga on her recommendation. She wrote a few songs with him, and it was the same thing – quick. But this time it was more directed by the management and label. They were after something specific. I wanted more acoustic and gentle, almost Americana, and they wanted bombast. They got what they wanted, and that was the extent of my foray into teen-pop territory. It was fun.”\n\n_image6_\n\n“She was always very assured,” adds Ainlay, who was introduced to Swift when she was 15, and working on her first record. “Even at that age. She had already done some modelling. It was like she knew she was going to be a hit artist… The songwriting style was immature but it seemed honest and real. Her voice was fragile but seemed to really get the emotion across.” He recalls Swift’s label and management trying to push her to work with writers they had singled out as a good fit. She had her own ideas – and wasn’t slow about speaking up.\n\nAdvertisement\n“She had a sense that [the direction in which she was being prodded] wasn’t really the right thing for her. She had been writing with [writer and producer] Nathan Chapman and said, ‘I like what I’m doing with Nathan.’”\n\nWhen Chapman reached out to Ainlay, the producer wasn’t sure what he was getting into. He typically works with stalwarts such as Mark Knopfler, for whom he has recorded since the later days of Dire Straits.\n\n“You never really know what to expect when you start working with a young girl. She was literally 15, I remember. I recall being so impressed with the music. She came in to listen to the first mix I had done. She sat down behind this big console – it was a very large control room – very intimidating. But she didn’t seem to be intimidated by the situation at all. She gave really good comments. I remember coming home telling my wife, ‘This girl has something – she could be a hit.’”\n\nThe confidence was, however, harder won that it might first seem. As songs such as ‘Shake It Off’ – essentially the chart version of Don’t Let The Bastards Get You Down – and ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ attest, Swift has had issues with haters and bullies. This goes all the way to her early adolescence when she was ostracised at an exclusive private school in Pennsylvania – an experience that both steeled her for a life in music and explains the streak of vulnerability in her lyrics.\n\n“Middle school? Awkward,” she told The New Yorker. “Having a hobby that’s different from everyone else’s? Awkward. Singing the national anthem on weekends instead of going to sleepovers? More awkward.\n\nBraces? Awkward. Gain a lot of weight before you hit the growth spurt? Awkward. Frizzy hair, don’t embrace the curls yet? Awkward. Try to straighten it? Awkward!”\n\n“I think who you are in school really sticks with you,” she continued. “I don’t ever feel like the cool kid at the party, ever. It’s like, smile and be nice to everybody, because you were not invited to be here.”\n\nAdvertisement\nAfter the fact, it has become fashionable to view Swift’s Nashville roots as evidence of her careerism. In fact, she was taking an enormous risk in trying to find success as a country artist.\n\n_image4_\n\nWith the exception of LeAnn Rimes – of whom Swift was a fan growing up – young female singers rarely thrive in country music. Both performers and the audience tend to be older. The truth is that Swift genuinely adored this music – and that her ambition to break Nashville was artistic rather than commercially motivated.\n\nAlso unusual was the degree of soul-baring in those early songs. From the start, Swift didn’t flinch when discussing her romantic travails. She would call out her beaus in music – taking unsubtle aim at boyfriends John Mayer (a good decade older than Swift), Joe Jonas and Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nThis honesty made her hugely relatable to her female fan-base, many of whom were wrestling with boy issues of their own (though they were unlikely to be chased by paparazzi as Swift was when seeing Harry Styles in 2014).\n\nJust as crucially, though, she eventually recognised her love life was in danger of becoming a spectator sport and, circa 1989, started to withhold. She still sang about her feelings – but was now considerably less specific. To abandon an approach that had brought huge success attested to her self-awareness and her ability to balance artistic and career concerns without coming across as fatalistically cynical.\n\n“The bigger pitfall is losing your self-awareness,” she told The New Yorker. “Even though I am at a place where my dresses are really pretty and the red carpets have a lot of bright lights and I get to play to thousands of people… You have to take that with a grain of salt. The stakes are really high if you mess up, if you slack off and don’t make a good record, if you make mistakes based on the idea that you are larger than life and you can just coast.”\n\nAdvertisement\nSwift hasn’t always got it right. After Kanye West gatecrashed her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards she wrote a mawkish ballad called ‘Innocent’, which painted the incident as a crime against humanity rather than an eruption of boorishness by an eccentric rapper. Her decision to take her music off Spotify – and to then reinstate it the day Katy Perry was putting out her new album – felt gimlet-eyed, too. Nobody was persuaded by Borchetta’s claim that Swift wanted to protect “super fans” who risked being mocked for buying the album when everyone else was listening to it for free.\n\nGenerally, however, Swift has navigated her professional life with extraordinary acuity. She has also kept her fanbase onside as they have aged out of teen confessionals and, like her, started engaging with the world as young adults.\n\n“Somewhere around the third album I remember thinking, ‘She’s going to have to move on from this,’” recalls Ainlay. “You know, writing songs for 12-year-olds. Otherwise she’s going to get too old for her fanbase or her fanbase will get too mature for her. She did do that – move on to another level.”\n\nOf all the artists he’s worked with, the producer says he has rarely come across someone with Swift’s ambition.\n\n“Her drive exceeds that of say Mark Knopfler… She is one of those, ‘I’m going to take on the world and win’ types. And she did. She has more drive than most artists I run into. The difference is that she has no problem with being a pop star. Some artists are more artistically inclined and want to do things for the sake of art… Now that she has matured, it seems she is coming to be a little more about the artistry and less about the stardom. But then she has already achieved that.” “Taylor knows her market,” adds Jacknife Lee. “She’s like a sniper.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "For Taylor Swift, Pop Is Personal\nHere, for ELLE’S Music Issue, the singer explains why she puts her heart and soul into every song.\n\nBy Taylor Swift\n\nUpdated: 28 February 2019\n\nMy favourite kinds of books to read are the ones that do more than just tell you a story. They do more than just set the scene or paint the picture.\n\nThe writing I love the most places you into that story, that room, that rain soaked kiss. You can smell the air, hear the sounds, and feel your heart race as the character’s does. It’s something F. Scott Fitzgerald did so well, to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations, that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment.\n\nI’m highly biased, but I think that the way music can transport you back to a long forgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time. To this day, when I hear \"Cowboy Take Me Away” by the Dixie Chicks, I instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old, sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in Pennsylvania.\n\nI’m clutching a guitar and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time, rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house. When I hear “I Write Sins Not Tragedies’” by Panic! At The Disco, I’m transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of Hendersonville, Tennessee, with my best friend Abigail, euphorically screaming the lyrics.\n\nWhen I hear “How to Save a Life” by The Fray, “Breathe (2AM)” by Anna Nalick, or “The Story” by Brandi Carlile, I immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end.\n\nWhen I’d get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew, I would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room - just being alone with those songs (Those are all from the Grey’s Anatomy soundtrack. My commitment to that show truly knows no bounds).\n\nI’m convinced that “You Learn” by Alanis Morissette, “Put Your Records On” by Corinne Bailey Rae and “Why” by Annie Lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs.\n\nI love writing songs because I love preserving memories, like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had. I like to use nostalgia as inspiration when I’m writing songs for the same reason I like to take photographs. I like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times.\n\nI want to remember the colour of the sweater, the temperature of the air, the creak of the floorboards, the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever.\n\nThe fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of. I thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being, well, universal.\n\nYou’d think that as pop writers, we’re supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to, so you’d assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic... AND YET the ones I think cut through the most are actually the most detailed, and I don’t mean in a Shakespearean sonnet type of way, although I love Shakespeare as much as the next girl. Obviously. (See “Love Story,” 2008).\n\nIn modern pop, songs/bops/chunes including extremely personal details like “Kiki, do you love me” and “Baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover” have been breaking through on the most global cultural level. This year on tour, I got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from Cuba singing about “Havana”.\n\nI think these days, people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to. We like being confided in and hearing someone say, ‘this is what I went through” as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles.\n\nWe actually do NOT want our pop music to be generic. I think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator, a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive.\n\nThis glimpse into the artist’s story invites us to connect it to our own, and in the best case scenario, allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories.\n\nIt’s this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal, or made us cry, dance, or escape that truly stands the test of time. Just like a great book.",

      "Transcript/Content": "30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30\n\nBy Cassandra Neely \nPublished: Mar 06, 2019 7:50 AM EST\n\nAccording to my birth certificate, I turn 30 this year. It's weird because part of me still feels 18 and part of me feels 283, but the actual age I currently am is 29. I've heard people say that your thirties are \"the most fun!\" So I'll definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when I know. But until then, I thought I'd share some lessons I've learned before reaching 30, because it's 2019 and sharing is caring.\nText, Font, Pink, Violet, Logo, Line, Purple, Magenta, Graphics, Material property, \n.\nI learned to block some of the noise. Social media can be great, but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you aren’t, how you’re failing, or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment. One thing I do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments. Yes, I keep comments off on my posts. That way, I’m showing my friends and fans updates on my life, but I’m training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that I look 🔥🔥🔥. I’m also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to “go die in a hole ho” while I’m having my coffee at nine in the morning. I think it’s healthy for your self-esteem to need less internet praise to appease it, especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist. An actual comment I received once.\n.\nBeing sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble. While it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady, this can contribute to some of your life’s worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you. Grow a backbone, trust your gut, and know when to strike back. Be like a snake—only bite if someone steps on you.\n\nTrying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal. It may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture (you had to give me one moment of bitterness, come on). BUT THAT SAID, it’s good to mess up and learn from it and take risks. It’s especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching. That’s GOOD. We’ll always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace. No, this is not an excuse to text your ex right now. That’s not what I said. Or do it, whatever, maybe you’ll learn from it. Then you’ll probably forget what you learned and do it again.... But it’s fine; do you, you’re searching.\n\nI learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body. I worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves, shinier hair, and more energy. I think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting, but taking it too far can be really dangerous. There is no quick fix. I work on accepting my body every day.\n.\nBanish the drama. You only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it. Be discerning. If someone in your life is hurting you, draining you, or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable, blocking their number isn’t cruel. It’s just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it.\n\nI’ve learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us. These messages tell women that we aren’t allowed to age. It’s an impossible standard to meet, and I’ve been loving how outspoken Jameela Jamil has been on this subject. Reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women we’re supposed to defy gravity, time, and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isn’t even remotely required of men.\n\nEvery day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love I’ve witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears.\nText, Font, Pink, Line, Magenta, Material property, Logo, Graphics, \n.\nMy biggest fear. After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months. There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe. My fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds. Websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address I’ve ever had online. You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things. Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love I’ve witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears.\n\nText, Font, Red, Line, Logo, Brand, Graphics, Trademark, \n.\nI learned not to let outside opinions establish the value I place on my own life choices. For too long, the projected opinions of strangers affected how I viewed my relationships. Whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me, or what they thought was “couples goals” based on a picture I posted on Instagram. That stuff isn’t real. For an approval seeker like me, it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my OWN value system of what I actually want.\n\nText, Magenta, Pink, Purple, Font, Violet, Lavender, Graphics, Brand, Graphic design, \n.\nI learned how to make some easy cocktails like Pimm’s cups, Aperol spritzes, Old-Fashioneds, and Mojitos because…2016.\n\nText, Font, Pink, Logo, Line, Brand, Material property, Graphics, \n.\nI’ve always cooked a LOT, but I found three recipes I know I’ll be making at dinner parties for life: Ina Garten’s Real Meatballs and Spaghetti (I just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground beef for meat), Nigella Lawson’s Mughlai Chicken, and Jamie Oliver’s Chicken Fajitas with Molé Sauce. Getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer. I also learned how to immediately calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit in my head. (Which is what I’m pretty sure the internet would call a “weird flex.”)\n\nI believe victims because I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying “This happened to me.”\nText, Font, Pink, Violet, Magenta, Purple, Line, Logo, Material property, Graphics, \n.\nRecently I discovered Command tape, and I definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if I’d hung things that way all along. This is not an ad. I just really love Command tape.\n\nText, Red, Pink, Magenta, Font, Graphics, Graphic design, \n.\nApologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you. Even if it was unintentional, it’s so easy to just apologize and move on. Try not to say “I’m sorry, but...” and make excuses for yourself. Learn how to make a sincere apology, and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships.\n.\nIt’s my opinion that in cases of sexual assault, I believe the victim. Coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through. I know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing, awful experience. I believe victims because I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying “This happened to me.” It’s something no one would choose for themselves. We speak up because we have to, and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we don’t.\n.\nWhen tragedy strikes someone you know in a way you’ve never dealt with before, it’s okay to say that you don’t know what to say. Sometimes just saying you’re so sorry is all someone wants to hear. It’s okay to not have any helpful advice to give them; you don’t have all the answers. However, it’s not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour. Your support is all someone needs when they’re at their lowest point. Even if you can’t really help the situation, it’s nice for them to know that you would if you could.\n.\nVitamins make me feel so much better! I take L-theanine, which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety. I also take magnesium for muscle health and energy.\n.\nBefore you jump in headfirst, maybe, I don’t know...get to know someone! All that glitters isn’t gold, and first impressions actually aren’t everything. It’s impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room, but what I know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them (I call it a “solid first 15”), but the layers of a person you discover in time. Are they honest, self-aware, and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it? Do they show up for you when you need them? Do they still love you after they’ve seen you broken? Or after they’ve walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if they’re people? These are things a first impression could never convey.\n\nAfter my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a Sharpie as eyeliner (DO NOT DO IT), I felt like I needed to start being nicer to my skin. I now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after I shower, not just in the winter, but all year round, because, why can’t I be soft during all the seasons?!\n.\nRealizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them. For example, never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me. Even as an adult, I still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall, or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at. In my twenties I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend. So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone. It’s important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them.\n\nPlaying mind games is for the chase. In a real relationship or friendship, you’re shooting yourself in the foot if you don’t tell the other person how you feel, and what could be done to fix it. No one is a mind reader. If someone really loves you, they want you to verbalize how you feel. This is real life, not chess.\n\nLearning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships. Something about “we’re in our young twenties!” hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family. And maybe they will be for the rest of your life. Or maybe they’ll just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. It’s sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships along the way, but you’ll always keep the memories.\n\nFashion is all about playful experimentation. If you don’t look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe, you’re doing it wrong. See: Bleachella.\n\nHow to fight fair with the ones you love. Chances are you’re not trying to hurt the person you love and they aren’t trying to hurt you. If you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from, there’s a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who “won” the fight. I know a couple who, in the thick of a fight, say “Hey, same team.” Find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built. They don’t give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship. They just give out divorce papers.\n\nThere’s a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art, that art and suffering go hand in hand. I’m really grateful to have learned this isn’t true. Finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool.\n\nI learned that I have friends and fans in my life who don’t care if I’m #canceled. They were there in the worst times and they’re here now. The fans and their care for me, my well-being, and my music were the ones who pulled me through. The most emotional part of the Reputation Stadium Tour for me was knowing I was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up. I’ll never forget the ones who stuck around.\n\nI’ve had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family. Both of my parents have had cancer, and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again. It’s taught me that there are real problems and then there’s everything else. My mom’s cancer is a real problem. I used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs. I give all of my worry, stress, and prayers to real problems now.\n\nI remember people asking me, “What are you gonna write about if you ever get happy?” There’s a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art, that art and suffering go hand in hand. I’m really grateful to have learned this isn’t true. Finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool.\n\nI make countdowns for things I’m excited about. When I’ve gone through dark, low times, I’ve always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app (they’re free) and adding things I’m looking forward to. Even if they’re not big holidays or anything, it’s good to look toward the future. Sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now, and it’s good to get some perspective that life will always go on, to better things.\n\nI learned that disarming someone’s petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh. In my experience, I’ve come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously. A few years ago, someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet. The fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than I’ve ever felt in my life, but I can’t tell you how hard I had to keep from laughing every time my 63-foot inflatable cobra named Karyn appeared onstage in front of 60,000 screaming fans. It’s the Stadium Tour equivalent of responding to a troll’s hateful Instagram comment with “lol.” It would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us, but maybe all I’ll ever get is the satisfaction of knowing I could survive it, and thrive in spite of it.\n\nI’m finding my voice in terms of politics. I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change. Only as someone approaching 30 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers. Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. I’m going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year.\n\nI learned that your hair can completely change texture. From birth, I had the curliest hair and now it is STRAIGHT. It’s the straight hair I wished for every day in junior high. But just as I was coming to terms with loving my curls, they’ve left me. Please pray for their safe return.\n\nMy mom always tells me that when I was a little kid, she never had to punish me for misbehaving because I would punish myself even worse. I’d lock myself in my room and couldn’t forgive myself, as a five-year-old. I realized that I do the same thing now when I feel I’ve made a mistake, whether it’s self-imposed exile or silencing myself and isolating. I’ve come to a realization that I need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice, trusting the wrong person, or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone. Step into the daylight and let it go.",

Leslie Roberts had been trying to get us together so Leslie had me sing at that RCA thing. She came up to me and said, \"Hi I'm Taylor, I love that song, would you write with me sometime?\", and I was like, \"Sure!\". We wrote a song called Never Mind and it was real pop and I remember sitting there thinking, \"Wow, I don't really know what I'm doing here.\" She didn't need me, I scribbled stuff down and kept her, you said this and this would be great and what if you say this yeah what if we turn, and that used to like really kind of go what i'm as i'm editor you \nknow but you know what? That the role and I was really lucky to be there. That experience was unbelievable.\n\nCL: You guys had a standing appointment after that, right? You all spent a lot of time together, she would not allow that amount of time unless there was a magic happening between you all.\n\nLR: Yeah, we really had a great thing, it was just always fun bouncing off ideas. You know, Jody Williams told me I was spending too much time with her and I said, \"Well, it's an hour and a half once a week, it's the funniest thing I do, there's just nothing like sitting in a room with her and and watching her songwriter mind go to work. I don't know what she's gonna do, but she's gonna do something\". That song we wrote [Never Mind], at the time her a&r or the label, I can't remember who, they said, \"This is great, could you get her to write something a little more country?\" And I remember I said, \"I'm not going to get her to do anything that she doesn't want to, she knows exactly who she is, and she's gonna do what she's gonna do.\" I think that's why it worked, I didn't put her in a room and say, \"Let me write you a song,\" or \"I'll teach you how to write a song.\" Around the time she left RCA, she said \"I'm just going to write with you for a while.\"\n\nLR: When we wrote Teardrops On My Guitar, she was writing at Sony's and they wanted her to change \"Drew\" to \"You\" so it would be more universal, so that if she didn't get a deal they could pitch it to someone else, and she was like, \"Respectfully, I think it's fine the way it is.\" I mean, she knew.",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Transcript by lovetheplayers on Tumblr] Carrie: It's time to welcome Taylor Swift.\nTaylor: Thanks for talking to me.\nCarrie: No worries. Well congratulations on the new single. Almost 100 million views on YouTube. You've broken records on Vevo, Amazon. Are you absolutely buzzing at the moment?\nTaylor: Um, yeah. It's crazy. This is insane. The fans have been so, so, so amazing for them to do that. Because you know obviously you put something out, you put all this work into it, you really try to make it something that they'll like and something that will entertain them, and the fact that they would watch it as many times as they have—It's really—I'm so grateful, honestly. I love getting to do this so it's really amazing that they make it so much fun to do this.\nCarrie: Well they're loving all the clues that you've put in the song. Is it clues of the new album, the date of the new album release. They're also still going crazy about a pic that you posted in February of you behind a fence with five holes. Can you tell us, is that a clue or is that just a really cool pic of you behind a fence?\nTaylor: Oh, my gosh. So that picture, I really just was trying to change up my Instagram aesthetic to get ready for the new album. I was just, like, posting pastel pictures to try to go from a dark to a light and kind of show them what the color scheme would be for the next album, but I love that they're that passionate. They will talk about that, like, in the \"fandom\"—that will be something they talk about for the next couple of years. They're so funny online of it. But yeah, I should've thought about that.\nCarrie: You were just being arty.\nTaylor: I love that you know about that. I can't believe you know about the five holes in the fence.\nTommy: Taylor, I thought that we could put all the talk of clues and albums up to rest and you could just potentially tell us when the album is coming out and what it's going to be called.\nTaylor: You know, that is such a good idea. That would make it so much easier, wouldn't it?\nTommy: And it would be a real scoop for us.\nTaylor: I don't think I'm gonna. I'm sorry.\nCarrie: All the billboards you put up teasing to it, one of them almost made me have a car accident because I was coming own a ramp at the freeway and I turned around to look at your billboard and nearly sideswiped my car.\nTaylor: No, never look at my billboard. Look at the road. Hands on the wheel, seat belt on. Be safe, kids.\nTommy: Stop making such intriguing billboards. It's your fault, Taylor.\nTaylor: Everything's my fault. Let's be honest.\nTommy: Hey, congratulations not only on the song, it's incredible. The film clip is also incredible and it features your new gorgeous cat Benjamin Button. I know that makes it three cats for you now. How many cats do you think before you become a crazy cat lady?\nTaylor: As many as it takes. As many as it takes.\nTommy: So that is the end goal we're going for?\nTaylor: I didn’t expect to meet this kitten. I met him on the video set actually, 'cause we had a scene where I wanted there to be this scene where symbolically, like, I wanted it to be kind of the symbolism of, like, if you’re into someone, don’t just do what you think people like. Don’t do just what you’ve heard. Don’t give a girl what you just think she would like 'cause you think girls like these things, like, get to know somebody and that will be more interesting if you actually know someone for who they are and what they actually think is cool. So we had this scene where he gives me flowers to try and win me back I say no, he gives me a ring to try to win me back, I say no. And so then he pulls a tiny kitten out of his jacket and I’m like, ‘Okay! You clearly know me.’ So I show up on set and there's this tiny little kitten, that was the sweetest kitten. I fell immediately in love with this cat 'cause he just started purring and immediately we were best friends and it was just set. And then they’re like, \"Oh, he doesn’t have a home so..\" I just knew immediately, yeah.\nTommy: Single men all over Australia have just gone out to get kittens to give away to women.\nCarrie: I wanna talk to you about some of the lyrics in the song because it is an absolute banger. It is caught in my head. We're gonna play the tune now. I love the lines in the song, and I love the line, \"I know I'm a psycho on the phone,\" because it just reminded me of the fact that us girls, we've all had moments of going absolutely cray cray for a man when when we've been in love. What's the craziest thing you've done when you've been besotted with somebody? The most psycho thing you've done?\nTaylor: Well, guys have had that moment too on the phone. This is not just a girl thing. I think that with this song we really just wanted to have this song not really be fully taking itself seriously. So the lyrics, that’s a tone decision that we mad in the studio. Like, we literally were like, \"Okay, let's say, ‘Hey kids, spelling is fun!'\" Because we want everyone to know that this song is not really serious because it's not, like, a serious love song. It’s about embracing and owning that you at times feel like, you know, you’re irreplaceable and I want those times to be more often when they hear this song and it gets stuck in their head. I think with a pop song you have the ability to get something stuck in people’s heads and I just want it to be a mantra that kind of is much more self-love than what we often times feel which is self-loathing and insecurity.\nTommy: Absolutely amazing single. It's caught in our heads. Make sure you check it out now if you haven't already. Taylor Swift just before we let you go, can you please tell us the album name and when it's going to be released?\nTaylor: Um, I will just get back to you. Just give me 20 seconds. I'm gonna go pet a kitten and then I'll come back and tell you.\nCarrie: Congrats on everything. Chat to you soon. Thank you so much for your time.\nTaylor: You guys are the best. Thank you.\nCarrie: Bye.\nTommy: Thanks so much, Taylor.\nTaylor: Bye!\nTommy: Bye!",

She'd hiss at Olivia, Olivia was tiny but would hiss back and I was like, \"Oh god, this is going to be so much hissing.\" But then when I brought him home they'd hiss at him and he would just, like, lay down on the floor and I'm like, \"dude.\" He's just a very chill cat. They kind of realized that he doesn't really care that much. He doesn't really wanna fight. He'll pounce on them every once in a while. He's like the annoying little brother.\nSmallzy: Lovely. You posted something on Twitter over the weekend saying that you gave away the title to the album somewhere in the music video of the new song. Now I'm just gonna, like, you can say \"warm\" or \"cold\" or you can say \"I'm not gonna comment.\" There's a fan theory: kaleidoscope. Is that warm or cold?\nTaylor: I'm not gonna comment because I really do respect their theories so much, you know. I'm gonna tell them all the information when I tell them.\nSmallzy: Okay, let's do it like that. I do have to talk about the music video. You and Brendon Urie. Congratulations on the song. Now I'm not sure but—the shoulder shimmies in that video clip are to die for, so congratulations to you both.\nTaylor: Thank you so much. I will tell him that you said that because we worked very hard on them. Thank you so much.\nSmallzy: Do you feel like he shoulder shimmied better than you do and you had to step up or were you teaching him a thing or two?\nTaylor: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I had to step up the whole video. I have to step up just every time I'm around him because he's like the best performer, and he has so much energy. Oh, my god. He goes into rehearsals and you have to really keep up. He's so amazing.\nSmallzy: Well, your new song is called ME! with Brendon Urie of Panic! At The Disco playing now. Taylor Swift on the air.\nSmallzy: Now when you were here in Australia with the reputation Tour it bucketed down with rain at the Sydney show. Now with that stadium tour did that happen many times or was there only a few shows where it rained as crazy as it did that night?\nTaylor: t happened more times on the reputation Tour than it did on any other tour I've done, but it was so much fun because we all just, like, danced in the rain together. It was really just, like, joyous and I think that the crowds not leaving—when I was younger I thought, like, if it rained everyone would leave. And I was always so scared of it raining. And then the first time I had a rain show I was like, \"Oh wait, people are staying?\" Like, that's when it became something that we all welcomed because I'm literally not going to cancel a show no matter what unless physically, like, they tell me that none of us can be on stage or whatever. If it's raining, like, bring it on. It's fun. I mean, the crowds—the more that they embrace that, the easier it is for, you know, for all of us to feel like it's not even raining. It turns it into even more fun. We just try not to slip because I slip and fall sometimes.\nSmallzy: Oh, my god. Yeah. You don't need that. Hey, our time is running out but I just quickly wanted to know, is there a message for the Aussie fans? They're very excited for the new song which, congratulations is like number one already here in Australia. And of course they want to know if you're planning on coming back anytime soon.\nTaylor: well I'm definitely working on the schedule right now and I love the Aussie fans more than I can even say, like, more than I can even verbalize. And I just love them for their passion, for caring about me and being so wonderful, and for making it number one. Thanks guys. That's amazing.\nSmallzy: Lovely. Well thank you very much for chatting. I will leave it on if the album is called Kaleidoscope, Lover, or Home, I called it first. If it's none of those three we'll pretend I never said it, alright?\nTaylor: Hey, hey, amazing. You have the theories. You're so sweet for even having a theory. That is so nice of you.\nSmallzy: I'm a Taylor fanboy, what can I say? Taylor Swift, thanks for chatting. I appreciate it.\nTaylor: You're the best. Thank you! Bye guys.\nSmallzy: Bye, bye!",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Transcript by lovetheplayers on Tumblr] Gethin: Good morning, Taylor. Thank you so much for being on Hits Radio. Listen, you are Taylor the tease aren't you? How do you keep such a big secret and not tell anyone? That's what we want to know.\nTaylor: It's really, really hard. With keeping secrets in terms of, like, song titles and album stuff. You know, it's actually, like, a testament to how much I can trust my friends because I played everything for all of my friends and they never said anything. We were doing—you saw how many dancers were in that video and not a single person on the video shoot talked about doing it. We did it over a month ago, so you really can trust people it turns out.\nDave: I got this thing that you might have just sent them all letters or maybe threatening them beforehand just to be sure they don't tell anyone anything.\nTaylor: You know, threatening probably doesn't work as well as just being like, \"Hey guys, can you please not tell people about this?\"\nGemma: The videos, Taylor. We were saying your songs are always fantastic but when you see them alongside the music video they're like wow, stunned out, fantastic. With regards to that, do you come up with the concepts or is it kind of a joint effort with your team. How do you come around with your videos? Because they're always so good.\nTaylor: Well thank you for saying that. I wrote this treatment and sent it to Dave Meyers and we then got together and just kind of thought about, \"How can we make the best visual effects out of this?\" And every single choice was essentially to foreshadow something that will happen in the course of the album. So everything in that video is basically an Easter egg. It takes a lot of time to plan that but it's really fun too because the fans have trained me over the last couple of years. When I was sixteen and I put out my first album I put codes in the lyric jacket of the CD. I capitalized certain letters. I was like, \"I wonder if they'll figure out that it spells out a code,\" and they did immediately and they were like, \"We love this, this is so fun.\" And from then on I've known that they like to play games with music. They like for it to be sort of a scavenger hunt or little Easter egg foreshadowing moments. So that makes it fun for me because I like for music to be, you know, as much of an event as possible. Yeah, so that's why I do that.\nDave: You know, everyone's obsessed in the UK at the moment with Line of Duty and of course globally, Game of Thrones. I know you're a big fan of Grey's Anatomy.\nTaylor: I just watched the new episode and fully cried the whole time.\nDave: Don't say anything because of the spoiler situation. But what else do you watch at the moment because I know you've probably completed Grey's Anatomy by now. I feel like you watch (...) You named a cat after it.\nTaylor: I'm not gonna spoil anything for you but I just will say I think it's the most beautiful episode they've ever done and that the score and the visual effects and the acting is like—I just think It's the greatest show of all time and I'm so excited for you to see this episode.\nDave: How'd you do that? You just gave us a load of information but not give us any information. You're the best at not spoiling things.\nTaylor: Thank you. I've gotten pretty good at being cryptic by keeping secrets about an album that isn't out yet. But basically I love Killing Eve as well. I love Flea Bag. Those are my favorite things right now.\nGethin: Flea Bag is good. Well I reckon your next single is coming out 13th of July because there were 13 clouds and 7 briefcases. I don't know what the 8:30 clock means but we'll carry on to try to find out. This song is gonna be on everyone's playlist this summer. Taylor Swift, thank you so much for joining us on Hits Radio Breakfast this morning.\nTaylor: Thank you, and Gemma congratulations on your new (...)\nGemma: Oh, thank you Taylor. Thank you so much.\nDave: Thank you, Taylor Swift.\nTaylor: Awesome. Bye guys.",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Transcript by lovetheplayers on Tumblr] Richie: Taylor, hello.\nTaylor: Good morning!\nRichie: How are you, my love? You okay?\nTaylor: I'm so good. I'm so happy to talk to you!\nRichie: I love the new song by the way.\nTaylor: Oh, you do? Thank you!\nRichie: I drove to Liverpool on the weekend which is about two hours from where I live and I must have listened to it about 20 times on the way there and 20 times on the way back; it's so good.\nTaylor: Seriously?\nRichie: Honestly. It was so amazing, we couldn't stop playing it all the way there, all the way back and already this morning I've listened to it twice, Taylor, so I'm feeling it.\nTaylor: Oh, you're so sweet to say that. Thank you. I really just feel, like, it's so nice when people say that it makes them happy. Like, that's legitimately the best thing you could say.\nRichie: Well in general, your music does. We were talking about your music on the show last week. You always make me kind of feel warm and fuzzy which is good, which is what music is meant to do.\nTaylor: Aw, thanks.\nRichie: So just give us sort of like a window into the world of Taylor Swift. Where are you right now?\nTaylor: I'm sitting on my couch; I have three cats within 20 feet of me which is how I prefer to exist. So I had rehearsals and then I came home and then I watched the latest episode of Game of Thrones which was beautiful. I'm not going to spoil anything for anyone but, whoa.\nRichie: You watch Game of Thrones with your cats? Are they your Game of Thrones buddies?\nTaylor: Well, I'll watch with anyone who wants to but I get really emotional so there's a lot of clapping and screaming and crying that happens when I watch Game of Thrones, so sometimes when I know it's gonna be, like, I heard this was going to be the most intense episode and it was, so I kind of felt like I should probably do this, you know, alone.\nRichie: Because I imagine that would scare the cats. I imagine they'd look at you like, \"Are you okay, hon?\"\nTaylor: They're so used to it.\nRichie: What I love about you is that you write your songs yourself. I mean, that is incredible and this new single ME! again you have written. Now with me, when I kind of have, like, an idea or a brainwave it seems to happen at the worst possible time, so, like, in the middle of the night, if I'm walking down the aisle in the supermarket. So what do you do if you're out and about and you get a melody or a lyric come to you?\nTaylor: Oh, completely. You never get an idea—almost never—when you're, like, sitting in a writing session or you're in the studio or something; it's always in the middle of the night. There are times when I've written a really cool hook in a dream and then you wake up and you're like, \"I'll definitely remember that, right?\" and then you don't. And that only has to happen to you a couple of times before you start recording every single idea you ever have and so my phone has all these, like, three second voice memos of me just, like, mumbling what I think might be a good idea and if you go back through them, like 97% of them are really, really terrible or completely unintelligible. Like, you have no idea. I'll be, like, \"That was 4:00 in the morning. I have no idea what this even is. This sounds like it doesn't even sound—it sounds like a grizzly bear. It doesn't even sound like a human.\" But sometimes you get an idea that really works out and this was one of—this was one of those where I had this idea, I stored it up for this writing session because I felt like when we when we went to the studio next this was the first thing I wanted to bring in, and so we constructed the first half of the song and then we're like you know what this seems like it might be a you know a narrative where we want another person in here to say his side of it, like a duet because it's about confidence, it's about expressing your individuality and I think that it's kind of cool to have, you know, the story be that this is a love song two people in a relationship but both of them feel irreplaceable within that relationship because I think people often times everybody struggles with insecurity, so I just wanted to get a song that was catchy enough to get stuck in people's heads that also makes them feel like they're worthy and special and irreplaceable.\nRichie: Now I love the video and it's already been one of the fastest most watched music videos on YouTube. 10 million views in just two hours. There's so many parts of this new video but what I also wonder, 'cause your videos are always very colorful, there's lots of outfits, there's a lot going on. Do you ever take any mementos from the set of your videos?\nTaylor: Oh, yeah, definitely. This didn't happen on this shoot but there have definitely been times where I've been, like, \"Okay, so this video has a really nice rug in this, you know, in this room. Can I buy this?\" When I bought my first apartment I was, like, always shopping basically on photo shoots and video shoots, being like, \"Is there any way that's for sale? Can I buy that for my apartment?\"\nRichie: Well Taylor, thank you so much for speaking to us. The next time you are in the UK please come and see us in the studio because you're welcome any time.\nTaylor: Well thanks for inviting me! I'll do that.\nRichie: I don't think Zoe would mind if you just turn up one Tuesday morning. And of course this year is your 30th birthday year, so I hope you have a fabulous 30th. I hope you've got a special party planned?\nTaylor: I haven't started planning. I don't even know what I'm gonna be doing in December but I think that's—like,the Cats movie is coming out so I have no idea—which I'm in. I didn't explain that at all, but I should have a party this year, shouldn't I?\nRichie: You should. I had a karaoke and I did Spice Girls tracks for all my friends and family. They weren't very thrilled about it, but I mean, that's an idea. I don't know if it's an American thing to get really drunk and sing in front of your family?\nTaylor: I think that's an amazing idea. Like, I might steal that idea completely because that sounds like the best.\nRichie: You know what, you can have that one, Taylor. Thank you so much and don't forget Taylor's brand new single and video for ME! is out now. Taylor Swift, you are absolutely lovely. Thank you so much, my darling.\nTaylor: Thank you! Great to talk to you.\nRichie: Lovely to speak to you too.\nTaylor: Bye!\nRichie: Bye!",

      "Transcript/Content": "New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7, fan theories, and her next era\nSnakes begone. The 29-year-old superstar is back with a new album and a new outlook on life. We go inside the pop monarch's latest chapter.\n\nBy Alex Suskind\nPublished on May 9, 2019 12:00PM EDT\n\nTHE PALM TREES ARRIVED IN FEBRUARY, seven in all, set against a pastel blue backdrop with superimposed stars. It appeared that a new Taylor Swift era was upon us — that the old happy-go-lucky Taylor was not, in fact, dead. Or did it? It was only an Instagram photo, just one more picture in an infinite content scroll. But it also came from a pop star known for prodigious hint-dropping, whose fans turn every piece of info into an online archaeological dig.\n\nAs expected, the summery post sent Swifties sifting through each detail with a fine-tooth comb. What did the trees symbolize? An overdue vacation? A recently purchased beach house? A secret palm-frond collection? Or maybe, as many surmised, it was new music. One Twitter user predicted that the number of stars in the background of the photo hinted at a single drop: \"There's about 60/61 [stars]️. There's 61 days until April 26, FRIDAY, a SINGLE RELEASE day!\" Another said it was the unofficial announcement of her next LP: \"Okay so in this picture there are 4 palm trees on the left (4 country albums). There are two palm trees on the right (2 pop albums). There is one large palm tree in the middle. This represents her new album.\" These may sound like ludicrous conspiracy theories — for the record, they were mostly correct — but they fit firmly within the Taylor Swift Musical Universe (it's like the Marvel Cinematic Universe but with more guitars and fewer Stan Lee cameos).\n\n\"I posted that the day that I finished the seventh album,\" says Swift about the photo. \"I couldn't expect [my fans] to know that. I figured they'd figure it out later, but a lot of their theories were actually correct. Those Easter eggs were just trying to establish that tone, which I foreshadowed ages ago in a Spotify vertical video for 'Delicate' by painting my nails those [pastel] colors.\"\n\new-1562-1563_32723783278832.jpg\nIt's now April, and the 29-year-old pop star is in a Los Angeles photo studio, giving her first sit-down magazine interview in three years. She wants to discuss the art of placing hints inside her work, as well as the upcoming record, which she recorded as soon as she finished the Reputation Tour. She's also keen on detailing her own obsessions, talking up the TV shows, books, and songs that help shape her outlook on life.\n\nOver the past 13 years, Swift has perfected the pop culture feedback loop: She shares updates about her life and drops hints about new music, which fans then gobble up and re-promote with their own theories, which Swift then re-shares on her Tumblr or incorporates into future clues. It's like a T-Swift-built Escher staircase of personal memories and moments that tease what's next. \"I've trained them to be that way,\" she says of her fans' astute detective work. Swift is a pop culture fanatic herself (see: the jean jacket she's wearing on the EW cover) and has an innate understanding of the lengths her audience will go to be a part of the original creation. \"I love that they like the cryptic hint-dropping. Because as long as they like it, I'll keep doing it. It's fun. It feels mischievous and playful.\"\n\nThrough this approach, Swift has designed the ultimate artistic scavenger hunt — and it's easy to get swept up in its drama, even if you don't listen to her music. Her moments aren't always hidden, either. Sometimes Swift highlights aspects of her world just so fans feel like they're on the journey with her. Like the time in March 2018 when pop singer Hayley Kiyoko was accused of shading Swift after mentioning her name during an interview. On Tumblr, Swift re-shared a fan's post, adding commentary that defended Kiyoko, which immediately dispelled any conflicts between the two artists; Swift's post subsequently received more than 29,000 notes. Four months later, she invited Kiyoko on stage during the Reputation Tour to sing her hit \"Curious.\" Kiyoko returned the favor when she had Swift join her that December at a benefit on behalf of the LGBTQ organization the Ally Coalition to perform \"Delicate.\" Fans of both artists were elated by the mutual support.\n\nts_373673289234932.jpg\nThe feedback loop also extends outside of music. In October 2018, Swift broke her silence about politics by publicly endorsing two candidates for office in her adopted state of Tennessee, while encouraging her followers to register to vote. She kept up the civic momentum through Election Day when she asked fans to post selfies after voting; Swift then eagerly re-promoted her favorites on Instagram stories.\n\nThis practice of sharing and re-sharing and sharing again is why listeners consider Swift one of the world's most accessible pop stars, someone willing to not only interact with her audience but invite them to secret listening sessions, or make the occasional surprise visit to their wedding or prom. It's a symbiotic relationship, one that, as Swift tells EW, helped her dig out of the darker era of reputation. \"It's definitely the fans that made that tonal shift in the way I was feeling,\" she says. \"Songwriters need to communicate, and part of communicating correctly is when you put out a message that is understood the way you meant it. reputation was interesting because I'd never before had an album that wasn't fully understood until it was seen live. When it first came out everyone thought it was just going to be angry; upon listening to the whole thing they realized it's actually about love and friendship, and finding out what your priorities are.\"\n\nThen, during the Reputation Tour, she had an epiphany: that despite the caricature that she thought had been created of her, there were many people who saw what others had simply refused to. \"I would look out into the audience and I'd see these amazing, thoughtful, caring, wonderful, empathetic people,\" she says. \"So often with our takedown culture, talking s— about a celebrity is basically the same as talking s— about the new iPhone. So when I go and I meet fans, I see that they actually see me as a flesh-and-blood human being. That — as contrived as it may sound — changed [me] completely, assigning humanity to my life.\"\n\nAt tour's end, she channeled that positive energy into the studio, recording the new album in just under three months. But the fast pace won't mean a short LP. Swift confirmed that her seventh record (she hasn't announced a title yet; the working nickname among fans is TS7) will include more songs than any of her previous releases. \"I try not to go into making an album with any expectation,\" she says. \"I started to write so much that I knew immediately it would probably be bigger.\"\n\nts_3276237489043443.jpg\nThe project will also feature a mix of old and new collaborators (on the candy-coated lead single \"ME!\" Swift brought in Panic! At the Disco frontman Brendon Urie and coproducer Joel Little, both of whom she had never worked with), but she is unsurprisingly coy about doling out much more information, as if doing so would break the carefully honed T-Swiftian feedback loop. \"There's a lot of a lot on this album,\" she says. \"I'm trying to convey an emotional spectrum. I definitely don't wanna have too much of one thing…. You get some joyful songs and you get the bops, as they say.\" There's also, she adds, some \"really, really, really, really sad songs,\" but \"not enough to where you need to worry about me.\"\n\nShe gives us one more clue: The true distinction between TS7 and reputation is in the delivery. \"This time around I feel more comfortable being brave enough to be vulnerable, because my fans are brave enough to be vulnerable with me. Once people delve into the album, it'll become pretty clear that that's more of the fingerprint of this — that it's much more of a singer-songwriter, personal journey than the last one.\"\n\nThe past month has seen a deluge of Swift activity, from the release of the new single to dropping more hints in interviews about the record and its title, which is apparently hidden somewhere inside the \"ME!\" music video (current fan guesses include Kaleidoscope and Daisy). But if the Easter eggs from the pop star seem like a business-as-usual routine, she says this album does indeed mark a new era of her life, where she's been better able to prioritize what's important to her.\n\n\"Our priorities can get messed up existing in a society that puts a currency on curating the way people see your life,\" she says. \"Social media has given people a way to express their art. I use it to connect with fans. But on the downside you feel like there are 3 trillion new invisible hoops that you have to jump through, and you feel like you'll never be able to jump through them all correctly. I — along with a lot of my friends and fans — am trying to figure out how to navigate living my life and not just curating what I want people to think living my life is. I'm not always able to maintain a balance, and I think that's important for everyone to know about. We're always learning, and that's something that I also had to learn — that I've got to be brave enough to learn. Learning in public is so humiliating sometimes…. Do I feel more balanced in my life than I ever have before? Um, probably yeah. But is that permanent? No. And I think being okay with that has put me in a bit of a better position.\" Strong words to live by, to quote, to re-share, to tweet back to her, and see if she'll respond.",

Here, in her own words, she gives us a run down on the musicians, TV shows, movies, and authors she's currently fanning over.\n\nLady Gaga\n\"When people think she's gonna go one way, she goes the exact opposite. She did that Tony Bennett record and won a Grammy. And then she pivots and goes and wins a Golden Globe for American Horror Story: Hotel. And then she pivots and does Joanne. And then she pivots and wins an Oscar for A Star Is Born. That's so cool, that ability to be so capable in so many different worlds. There's so much dexterity to her career.\"\n\nAmazon Prime’s Fleabag\n\"I'm really, really obsessed with Phoebe Waller-Bridge and her writing. I love Fleabag. I just am so impressed by her body of work, her humor. What I love about is she makes you crack up laughing, shocks you, and breaks your heart all in the span of a few minutes in that show.\"\n\nKing Princess\n\"I love the romantic a of what she is doing. It is very nostalgic.\"\n\nLana Del Rey\n\"Her imagery. It's poetic. It's also full of modern pop culture and throwback nostalgia. Anything that she puts out, I'm going to not only listen to but do a full read-through of the lyrics.\"\n\nTaylor-Swift\nTaylor Hill/FilmMagic; Mike Pont/Getty Images; Gareth Cattermole/TAS18/Getty Images; David Crotty/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images; Taylor Hill/Getty Images\nTayla Parx\n\"There's a song called 'I Want You' by [veteran pop songwriter] Tayla Parx. She's amazing. I love what a great writer she is. Her catalog is so impressive. I'd always seen her name credited and I'd always thought, 'She's incredible. This writer is so on fire.' But you hear her voice and you see that she really is a force.\"\n\nSally Rooney\n\"I really like her book Conversations With Friends. I like the tone she takes when she's writing. I think it's like being inside somebody's mind.\"\n\nBBC America’s Killing Eve\n\"I'm just sort of obsessed with all things Killing Eve. I just watched the first episode of season 2. Jodie Comer doing all those dialects is absolutely incredible to me. Also, I don't think we've really seen such a lovable psychopath, where you really want to hang out with her but you should not. It's amazing. Oh god, it's so intoxicating. We've only ever seen that kind of endearing badness in men until recently, where we start to see female characters that are able to breakthrough that constant likability challenge we find ourselves in — where men are allowed to be bad but also, you know, wink, it's very sexy.\"\n\nDrake\n\"I love his one-liners. Like 'You say I led you on/But you followed me.' Or 'This a Rollie, not a stopwatch/It don't ever stop.'\"\n\nWon’t You Be My Neighbor?\n\"I was watching this movie sitting in bed bawling when all of a sudden, society decided that Mister Rogers had poisoned the youth of America by telling them each that they're special. And I was so upset because my mom raised me with [his] same mindset: You're special, everyone's special, everyone's an individual and deserves to have a beautiful, happy life and do what they love. And I would come home and I would watch Mister Rogers every single day when I got home from school. And that's the mindset that I try to tell fans. Like, you're special. You actually are. You're not replaceable, you're not worthless. Even if sometimes you feel those things, that's not true. And so when they're demonizing someone who tried to do nothing but lift up the imaginations and self-confidence and self-esteem of kids, I was weeping. So I called my mom, and she's like, 'Are you okay? Have you been in an accident?' I was like, [mock cry-shouting] 'He was just trying to do a good thing!'\"\n\nCiara\n\"I think that Ciara's song 'Thinkin Bout You' is amazing. I listen to it every day when I wake up. It has the cutest video ever. She's so nice too. She's been working hard and just being a gracious, wonderful person to everyone she meets — and challenging herself and making cool stuff. I just love it when people do that.\"\n\nAlanis Morissette\n\"I love the idea of a confessional songwriter — what Alanis Morissette was doing back in the '90s [where] she's just unafraid of expressing raw emotion. That was really inspiring to me. We're constantly moving further away step by step from the old, horrendous mindset that when a man shares his emotions, it's brave. But when a woman shares her emotions, she's oversharing. I think that the more women that tell their stories in an unapologetic, detailed, honest way, the better off we are.\"\n\nDixie Chicks\n\"The Dixie Chicks were making such interesting music and doing it in such an unapologetically feminine, imaginative way. I was very inspired by the album Fly and the aesthetics, because it was very clear they had really put a lot into the artwork. And so it got my brain thinking bigger in terms of, you know, you make an album, but then you can choose an entire look and color palette and aesthetic and symbolism and imagery and backstories — that you can really make an album even more of an experience if you so choose.\"\n\nDermot Kennedy\n\"I think it's very poetic what he says, you know. Like he'll include the word 'reverie.' I'll be like, thank you Dermot Kennedy for saying reverie in a song in 2019. We need that.\"\n\nBritney Spears’ Laughter\n\"It's heaven. It's like a summer's day. And it makes you so happy. You wish you were there laughing with her and having a party.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Transcript by lovetheplayers on Tumblr] Taylor: Hey, it's Taylor.\nShannon: Hey, how's going?\nTaylor: It's going so great. How are you?\nShannon: Good! Thank you so much for this chance to talk to you. It's an honor.\nTaylor: Oh my gosh. Thank you for saying that; that's so sweet.\nShannon: Okay, so I want to start off by asking, Reputation--it was so full of, like, angst and snakes and things. What made you decide to go in a whole separate route for this new single?\nTaylor: Well, I think I was feeling differently. You know with my albums, they're very reflective of kind of my mood and how I'm feeling and what's going on in my life, and so it's always very reflective of that. And so, yeah, I feel like I'm in a much brighter, more glittery place in life, so that's why the music looks more glittery and bright colors.\nShannon: Can we kind of expect the same kind of theme for the whole album?\nTaylor: The album has lots of different kind of emotional tones to it, you know, just in the same way that, like, a person's never going to just be happy all the time. When I make an album it's not ever just going to be a happy album because, you know, we're hopefully complex individuals and as a songwriter you try to reflect that and, you know, I think that with this album it's definitely very—it's got a very diverse emotional spectrum of things that are on the album and that's why it's so hard for me to always pick the first single. Like, that's always the most difficult choice that I face because when the album is such a vast landscape of emotions it's so weird to have to pick one song that represents all of those. That's why it's good that you can put out, you know, a lot of music before an album comes out and kind of give people a taste for what the album actually is.\nShannon: What made you want to go with ME! for the first single then?\nTaylor: I wanted to go with ME! for the first single because it's just sort of a celebration and it kind of bursts open this new world that I see as this new album. It's very—it's very flamboyant and colorful and sort of playful and mischievous. Like, it's definitely like a very playful song but at the heart of it... actually I think with a pop song and especially a very catchy pop song... Like, when I wrote it I was like, \"Okay that's pretty catchy.\" So, like, we have an opportunity as writers to say something that other people are going to sing in their head consciously or subconsciously, right? Like, sometimes you don't even mean to have a song stuck in your head. But if you have a song stuck in your head and it's saying, \"I'm the only one of me,\" like, that's kind of like a mantra, so you know I hoped that it would, like, go out into the world and, like, make the world a little bit happier. I don't know.\nShannon: And I definitely think that that song does it. It's perfect for that.\nTaylor: Thank you.\nShannon: Yeah, so there's a ridiculous amount of Easter eggs that are in this new video. This isn't a totally new thing for you either but what made you want to start playing that game with fans in the beginning?\nTaylor: Well I started doing this when I was about 16 and I put out my first album and put out, you know, the album booklet and I just had this idea where I would capitalize letters and, like, if you put the letters all together they would spell out a code, and I was like, \"I wonder if any of the fans will pick up on this?\" And they did right away and they loved it and told me that I should do more of that and so it's kind of—it's kind of escalated now to a point where I will plan out a music video months and months and months in advance and think about, like, \"What can I drop here, what can I plant here?\" And it's the more that they've had fun with it, the more that I've had fun with it because I think it kind of expands a music experience. It kind of makes it more of, like, a visual experience; it's kind of like a brain teaser; Kind of, like, something that makes you think about what you're seeing. It makes you go back and, like, notice the details and so that's kind of why I do it because it also kind of plays into, like, the mischief of this new era of music that I'm trying to put out which is, like, a little bit more playful than last time, you know?\nShannon: Oh totally yeah. I can see that. Is it frustrating watching people guess things online like the album title in the video and then seeing them get it but not being able to just tell them?\nTaylor: No, no I—I definitely am going to tell them.\nShannon: Yes, but is it frustrating seeing that they they get it already but you, like, haven't said anything yet?\nTaylor: Some of them have gotten it but some of them haven't so it's, um, they're very clever and, like, all their ideas are very well researched and they have a lot of reasons for why they have their theories which I think is great. Like, I'm a big Game of Thrones fan. I have you know, I've had theories going the entire time I've been watching the show and when my theories are proven wrong I'm not, like, disappointed; I just find it fun to have a theory in the first place and to see if it'll happen. But just—you know, just like some of my theories about Game of Thrones have been right, you know, a lot of their theories on the album title have been right. A lot of them will be, like, high-fiving each other when they realize they were right all along.\nShannon: True. I like that. Also, congrats on your new family member.\nTaylor: Thank you so much.\nShannon: So you didn't actually plan on adopting him until you met him on set. Is that correct?\nTaylor: That is correct, and we actually just put up today—on YouTube we put up this behind the scenes video of me meeting the kitten and, like, I literally meet him—I'm so glad they were filming this; like, I didn't realize there was a behind-the-scenes camera filming the whole time they hand me the kitten. And I fell in love with him immediately because he's so sweet. He loves people and so he just started purring as soon as I, like, held him and he is the sweetest, most loving little cat I've ever met in my whole life.\nShannon: What made you decide to go with the name Benjamin Button?\nTaylor: I really liked the movie Benjamin Button. Benjamin Button in the movies is just such a good guy; he's always doing the right thing.\nShannon: That's true, that's very true, yeah. I like that a lot. Okay thank you so much for letting me have the chance to chat with you. I really appreciate it.\nTaylor: Thank you so, so, so much. It was great talking to you.\nShannon: Alright have a great day.\nTaylor: Have a good day.",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Transcript by lovetheplayers on Tumblr] Mocha: Hello, is this the one, the only Taylor Swift?\n\nTaylor: Hi, how are you?\n\nMocha: Doing great. It's the Roz and Mocha show. You are talking to, like, every single person in Canada right now. What would you like to say to your Canadian fans?\n\nTaylor: Oh, my god. That's so much pressure. I just want to say thank you for everything. They've been amazing and I can't wait to see them again. How are you doing?\n\nMocha: You know what, we're on the phone with you finally, we're so happy, and we know how busy your life is. You just wrapped up the Reputation World Tour in November. When did you start working on new music for this new album?\n\nTaylor: I started working on it pretty much immediately after that, but I did have a lot of ideas that I've been kind of cultivating while I was on tour, so as soon as I got off tour I just went right into the studio and pretty much stayed there.\n\nMocha: Okay, and how long did that that process take from the time—like, was there any type of downtime after the tour to when you started working on new music?\n\nTaylor: Not really, um, I just—I was very ready to make the next thing. I knew exactly what I wanted to make next.\n\nMocha: Okay.\n\nTaylor: Sometimes that takes a long time. Like, for the album before it, reputation, that took me a very long time to realize what I wanted to make because after—the album before that was 1989 and I felt so kind of stifled by, like, \"Okay, what do I do now?\" But with this album I just knew exactly what I wanted to make and so I started making it immediately.\n\nMocha: And how does a collaboration like ME! come to light where you're working with Brendon Urie? Like, do you reach out to him, did he reach out to you? Were there talks of you guys working on music together? Are you writing together in the same room; are you texting back and forth?\n\nTaylor: Well, yeah. It is very organic like that. Well basically, like, I was writing the song. I wrote the chorus and the first verse with Joel Little who wrote and produced the song with me, and we were in the studio and I was just thinking, \"I think this needs to be a duet. I think it would be cool if both people in a relationship were saying this about each other and about themselves, just in the nature of, you know, you're worthwhile and irreplaceable, and so am I and that's why this works,\" and kind of make it into more of a conversation. And I also wanted it to be very playful. I didn't want it to take itself seriously at all, so I was thinking, \"Who would be an amazing person to bring in to really elevate this; who could be such a good performer and who would want to do this and really want to perform with me on, like, award shows?\"\nLike, you want someone who's going to be a full team player—no pun intended with the song. But basically I thought of Brendon and I was thinking, \"I wonder if he would want to do this,\" because obviously he's having such an amazing year and I figured he's so busy, but then I saw that he had said in an interview that he would love to collaborate with me and I was like, \"Oh, my god. Maybe he'll do it.\" So I, like, reached out to his management and he was immediately on board. He literally came to the studio, like, a week later and recorded his part and also, like, helped write the bridge with us and just really finished the song with his personal touch on it which was nice.\n\nMocha: Oh, so all it takes is a shout-out to Taylor Swift. So if I said right now next time Taylor Swift that you were in Toronto and we would love to have you live in studio on the Roz and Mocha show, we could totally make that happen?\n\nTaylor: Well that would definitely help, yes.\n\nMocha: In the lead-up to the release of ME! you made an appearance at the the NFL Draft which had some people, including my co-host Roz, speculate that you might be performing at next year's Superbowl halftime show.\nWe know that or may not know that you are or not working with Coke anymore which would totally open the door for a deal at the Pepsi halftime show.\n\nTaylor: I mean, I hadn't even thought about it, but I'm really flattered that you have such big dreams for me.\n\nMocha: The internet detectives are out there. Your fans are the ones that are piecing this together as well.\n\nTaylor: Yeah, they're really—they're so, so clever and I mean with that I really just thought it was a coincidence that it was in Nashville.\nLike, the NFL Draft is in Nashville and I'm from Nashville and that was really—it was the Nashville connection. I wasn't, like—I wasn't, like, at that point in time I wasn't, like, leaving a cryptic tapestry. But I am with most things.\n\nMocha: Okay, and other than Brendon Urie are there any other features on the new album?\n\nTaylor: I'm gonna definitely let people kind of discover that when the time comes. You are so curious and I love it. I'm loving your energy.\n\nMocha: I'm asking the questions that the fans are trying to get answers to as well, including the album title.\n\nTaylor: I don't break under interrogation.\n\nMocha: Taylor Swift, it was such a pleasure talking to you. Thank you so much. Again, I know that you're super, super busy right now. Congratulations on the success of ME! especially breaking YouTube and VEVO in 24 hour view records.\nThat is amazing; we cannot wait to see you live in person in Canada, across the entire country in various cities. You know this country has mad love for you. Thank you, thank you, thank you and we can't wait for the album\n\nTaylor: Well thank you so much. It's awesome talking to you too, and thank you for saying that you can't wait for the album. That's amazing to hear. I'll talk to you guys soon and hopefully see you.\n\nMocha: Yeah, for sure. Take care, Taylor.\n\nTaylor: Bye",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Translation by gavinmtl on Tumblr] Writing is the favourite part of my job because it is a way of communicating how you feel and then having that song go out to the rest of the world, and when other people say, “Oh, I felt that way too”, it’s very validating. \n\nIt’s a whole process song writing - it’s not just sitting down and writing. It’s writing a song, it’s recording a song,  sending it out, and then eventually you’ll be standing on stage and performing for a crowd. \n\nIt’s a really beautiful cycle, and I always try to remember that my actions affect other people, so I do think about that a lot. \n\nThen the radio host then goes on to explain that while there is no set release date as of yet, there are clues within the music video.\n\nI wanted to pay homage to old American films. I wanted it to have a surreal kind of drama, very romantic, and very fantastical. It goes with the new aesthetic that I wanted to portray: pastel colours, bright colours, glitter… Our main influences were musicals, and I’m really happy with how it turned out. \n\nME! is about individuality and the fact that it’s okay to be different. Sometimes, we feel so insecure, and you really feel so low at times, and bad about ourselves, and I wanted to send a positive message about ourselves.\n\nWhen we decided to bring in Brendon, it was really about having a conversation between a couple, and having two people feel confident about themselves, and also feeling confident that the other person is very special, too. \n\nI wanted it to sound classic, and yet have something retro, with a horn section, but I also wanted it to feel very new.

      "Transcript/Content": "[Official Transcript] 1LIVE: Hello Taylor!\n\nTaylor: Hi! How are you?\n\n1LIVE: We're doing well. We play “ME!” regularly on 1LIVE, and it feels like it turns a rainy day into a sunny one.\n\nTaylor: Thank you! I'm proud of the song and the best thing anyone can say about it is that it helps you get rid of a bad mood, appreciate yourself more or just be happy.\n\n1LIVE: Why Brendon Urie from Panic! At The Disco? Why was he the perfect partner for a song together?\n\nTaylor: Because he's a great performer. And he does everything he does with a lot of enthusiasm. He's also always been great to his fans, has a lot of experience and is always up for new challenges. And he enjoys trying new things. I've always been a big fan of his. When I was about halfway through writing the song, I contacted Brendon and asked him if he wanted to write the other half with us and if we wanted to record the duet part of the song together.\n\n1LIVE:  Your argument in French at the beginning of the video: Did you manage it the first time or did you have to repeat the scene forever because you kept laughing?\n\nTaylor: (laughs) It actually took us a few tries because we were laughing so much. It's fun to argue in a movie scene, no matter what language you're speaking, but trying to get the French pronunciation right is really funny. We just posted a video on YouTube that shows a behind-the-scenes look at the scene. You can see how many times we made mistakes and burst out laughing. If you want to watch it, you'll see that we definitely didn't get it perfect the first time.  \n\n1LIVE: On the content of \"ME!\": What personal experience made you realize that the most important thing in life is to love yourself?\n\nTaylor: I think that self-love and good self-esteem are not something you can take for granted. You shouldn't put pressure on yourself to feel good all the time. Nobody is always confident. But I think that if you have a song that makes you feel good and reminds you that you are unique, then that helps you overcome your insecurity. I definitely struggle with self-doubt. That's maybe why I wrote this song. I wanted to have a song that I could perform live and that would hopefully pull me out of these negative feelings.\n\n1LIVE: It must be difficult to say, \"Hey, here I am and I love myself exactly as I am\" - without sounding too self-absorbed.\n\nTaylor: Yes, definitely! I think that today with social media we see so many people to compare ourselves to, and it's always like we're not as good or as cool or as good looking as someone else. We really need to be aware that everyone goes through this and that these comparisons are damaging to ourselves. The message of the song is that no one else in the whole world is exactly like you. I'm trying to create something that makes people feel better.\n\n1LIVE: When I open Instagram and think to myself: \"He has a better job than me, he's on a wonderful vacation and I'm sitting here at work...\", I feel bad because of all the comparisons. But you're a world-famous pop star. I can't really imagine that you feel bad when you scroll through Instagram.\n\nTaylor: Oh yes! I feel like that all the time. Sometimes I just have to take a break from social media because I feel like everyone else is so much cooler than me. That's something we all go through. There are so many people on social media, so many beautiful, wonderful girls that I look at and think, \"Oh my God, their life is perfect!\" And when I get to know them, I realize that they have that insecurity too. They go online and feel so bad. I think it helps to know that other people feel the same way. That's what we connect with, that's what we all have in common. And we all want to escape those feelings, even if it's just for the duration of a song where we say to ourselves, \"I'm special, I'm different.\" Even if we don't really believe it, I think it's good to tell ourselves that.\n\n1LIVE: Everything you're releasing at the moment hints at a new album. Can we also find clues to the title of the record in the video for \"ME!\"?\n\nTaylor: There are definitely some clues in the video that can give you the title of the album. I won't confirm the title right now because I don't want to overwhelm the fans with information. Let them enjoy the song and the video first, and then they'll get all the info about the album soon. But there are so many \"Easter eggs\" in the video! The title of the second single is also in the music video. I'm having fun playing hide and seek!\n\n1LIVE: Are there any fans who have figured it all out?\n\nTaylor: They've figured out some things, but not everything. There are clues that you won't understand the full meaning of until the album comes out. Many of them are lyrical references to lyrics in another song that the fans haven't heard yet. It's really fun and kind of exciting to drop hints. I'm really lucky that the fans are interested enough to look for the clues. \n\n1LIVE: In what situation should we listen to your new album when it's out?\n\nTaylor: I try to make albums that have different facets, different songs for different occasions. I want to have a song that's perfect for falling in love. A song that's perfect for a road trip with the windows open on a sunny day. A song for when you're upset and sad and a song for you and your friends when you want to go out and party. Or a song that you put on in the kitchen while you cook. Or a song that you lie in the bath to... (laughs). That's my goal when I make albums: I want to make music for all occasions. Then when the album is released, you have to tell me if I accomplished all of that. \n\n1LIVE: When are you coming to Germany on tour?\n\nTaylor: I definitely want to come back, the fans in Germany were so lovely and wonderful last time, I really miss you. I'm definitely planning shows in Germany. \n\n1LIVE: Do your cats travel with you or do they stay at home?\n\nTaylor: They're pretty good travelers. They've been used to traveling since they were little kittens, so they go pretty much everywhere with me. We're a family. \n\n1LIVE: Are there certain rooms in your home that they are not allowed to enter? \n\nTaylor: No, they can go anywhere. They're everywhere in the house. I'm always surrounded by a team of cats. When you have three cats, they're everywhere. One sits here, the others sit there - and they all stare at you. That's exactly the world I want to live in.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift has shared a number of details about her hit single “ME!” ahead of her appearance on The Graham Norton Show. The pop star spoke exclusively with The Independent about the track, which features Panic! At the Disco frontman Brendon Urie and is the first single from her forthcoming seventh album. In a review, The Independent said the song heralds a “bright new era” for Swift, suggesting that the new sound appears to “signal a time – at least one she intends on practising – of positivity and acceptance”. \n“The world is a dark enough place, she seems to say, without another album despairing at the state of it,” it said. ”She’d rather let the light in, instead.” \n“ME!” broke a number of music industry records upon release, including the biggest 24-hour debut on YouTube. The video contains several clues about more new music, including references to the album title. \nRead our Q&A with Swift, below, for her thoughts on “ME!” along with insights into what to expect from TS7.\n\nThere are so many musical references in the video – which did you draw particular inspiration from?\n\nI watch a lot of films and I’ve always loved musicals. With this video, I wanted it to be sort of a love letter to romantic, epic musical films, but always with a weird eccentric twist. Some of it was inspired by big Disney films, or classics like Singin’ in the Rain (or in this case, singing in a monsoon of fluorescent pastel paint). The love story between the two main characters in these films tends to be very performative, and that’s exactly what I wanted Brendon and my dynamic to be. Demonstrative and showy. Dramatic, but never taking itself too seriously.\n\nWhat other pop culture references do you think people might have missed in the video?\n\nI wanted to channel Pattie Boyd in the Sixties scene because I adore her. Two glasses of wine and I’m immediately yelling about how much I love Pattie Boyd. I also liked the idea of flipping some old romantic stereotypes, like how a man would make a grand gesture in the street for a girl up on a balcony to make it up to her. Instead it’s me and a bunch of bad ass women in business suits doing the wooing. Then he tries to win me back with a few cliched lady traps like flowers and a ring. But I’m like no, nah. But he hands me a cat? Okay, he must know me.\n\nWhat made you want to work with Brendon Urie on the song?\n\nBrendon is the kind of performer I’ve always been in awe of. Endless energy, creativity and the desire to evolve every time he makes something new. You also never hear anyone in the industry say anything other than “he’s the nicest, loveliest person”. He’s actually got so many great qualities it’s almost obnoxious.\n\nHow many seconds was it before you decided to adopt Benjamin Button (the kitten from the ME! video)?\n\nI think for the sake of being extra, I’ll say 13. You know when people say “I saw him and I just KNEW” when they meet the one? Yeah I walk around saying that about a cat.\n\nHow many clues are there to the album title in the video?\n\nI think you see it once and you hear it twice.\n\nWhen did you learn to speak French and what made you want to include it in the video?\n\nI’ve always loved the French language. I think I probably love the French language as much as any non-French speaker can. I wanted to have a nod to that and to the language of love. I also wanted to drop a few hints in the dialogue of the argument.\n\nWhat was the main or most important message you wanted to send to fans with ME!?\n\nI wanted them to see that I’m heading in a different direction musically than they’ve seen in the past few years. This song was to change expectations and be a bit of a palette cleanser before they hear more of this new project. Plus, the chorus just makes me happy and lifts my mood when I sing it. I never want to be presumptuous, but I hoped it might do the same for someone who’s having a s***ty day.\n\nHave you ever wondered about whether your clues are too well-hidden or do you trust your fans’ detective skills enough that they’ll get there eventually?\n\nI trust them to eventually unravel all of them, even if it isn’t until they hear the full album. That’s how I designed these clues, so that different ones would reveal themselves over time. I know this makes me sound like a frustrating, magical elf making people guess my name or something. If the fans tell me they’re not having fun with it anymore, I swear I’ll stop!\n\nHow long has this song been in the making? Because there are references that link as far back as 2012...\n\nI wrote the song this past winter, but I’ve known for quite a while what I wanted this album to look like, feel like, and evoke. I wanted it to be like the sky looks after a storm. Colourful, calm, somehow more beautiful than it ever had been before.\n\nME! is a song that seems to try and brush away cynicism about being a bit silly and just having fun – was this a message you were really intent on sending to fans, maybe especially in 2019?\n\nAbsolutely. It seems like everyone is trying to be so cool and over everything and ready to criticise whatever people make. I mean there are even articles like “Here’s how Twitter feels about _______!” and people are actively being as scathing as possible or taking the piss out of everything because they get attention for it now.\n\nI wanted to put out something that, by nature of it being so buoyant, was actually the opposite of what culture is doing right now. Will it work? I don’t really care. It’s just fun to sing about being in a good mood for a change.",

      "Transcript/Content": "IT’S A SUNDAY AFTERNOON in Tribeca, and I’m in Taylor Swift’s loft, inside a former printing house that she has restored and fortified into a sanctuary of brick, velvet, and mahogany. The space is warm and cozy and vaguely literary—later, when we pass through her bedroom en route to her garden, 10 percent of my brain will believe her wardrobe might open up to Narnia. Barefoot in a wine-colored floral top and matching flowy pants, Swift is typing passwords into a laptop to show me the video for “You Need to Calm Down,” eight days before she unleashes it on the world.\n\nI have a sliver of an idea what to expect. A few weeks earlier, I spent a day at the video shoot, in a dusty field-slash-junkyard north of Los Angeles. Swift had made it a sort of Big Gay Candy Mountain trailer park, a Technicolor happy place. The cast and crew wore heart-shaped sunglasses—living, breathing lovey-eyes emoji—and a mailbox warned, LOVE LETTERS ONLY.\n\nSwift and a stream of costars filmed six scenes over about a dozen hours. The singer-songwriter Hayley Kiyoko, known to her fans as “Lesbian Jesus,” shot arrows at a bull’s-eye. The YouTube comedian-chef Hannah Hart danced alongside Dexter Mayfield, the plus-size male model and self-described “big boy in heels.” The Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon served up icy red snow cones. Swift and her close friend Todrick Hall, of Kinky Boots and RuPaul’s Drag Race, sipped tea with the cast of Queer Eye.\n\nThe mood was joyous and laid-back. But by the end of the day, I wasn’t sure what the vignettes would add up to. There were shoot days and cameos I wouldn’t observe. For security reasons, the song was never played aloud. (The cast wore ear buds.) Even the hero shot, in which Swift and Hall sauntered arm in arm through the dreamscape at golden hour, was filmed in near-total silence.\n\nFor weeks afterward, I tried to sleuth out a theory. I started casually. There was a “5” on the bull’s-eye, so I did a quick search to figure out what that number might mean. Immediately I was in over my head.\n\nSwift has a thing for symbols. I knew she had been embedding secret messages in liner notes and deploying metaphors as refrains since her self-titled debut in 2006—long before her megafame made her into a symbol of pop supremacy. But I hadn’t understood how coded and byzantine her body of work has become; I hadn’t learned, as Swift’s fans have, to see hidden meanings everywhere. For instance: In the 2017 video for “Look What You Made Me Do,” a headstone in a graveyard scene reads NILS SJOBERG, the pseudonym Swift used as her writing credit on Rihanna’s hit “This Is What You Came For,” a Swedish-sounding nod to that country’s pop wizards.\n\nAfter an excessive amount of ad hoc scholarship—a friend joked that I could have learned Mandarin in the time I spent trying to unpack Swift’s oeuvre—I was no closer to a theory. Pop music has become so layered and meta, but the Taylor Swift Universe stands apart. Apprehending it is like grasping quantum physics.\n\nMy first indication of what her new album, Lover, would be about came just after midnight on June 1, the beginning of Pride Month, when Swift introduced a petition in support of the federal Equality Act. This legislation would amend the Civil Rights Act to outlaw discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. (It has passed the House, but prospects in Mitch McConnell’s Senate are unclear.) Swift also posted a letter to Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, asking him to vote yes. The request, on her personal letterhead (born in 1989. LOVES CATS.), denounced President Trump for not supporting the Equality Act. “I personally reject the president’s stance,” Swift wrote.\n\nBack in the kitchen, Swift hits play. “The first verse is about trolls and cancel culture,” she says. “The second verse is about homophobes and the people picketing outside our concerts. The third verse is about successful women being pitted against each other.”\n\nThe video is, for erudite Swifties, a rich text. I had followed enough clues to correctly guess some of the other cameos—Ellen DeGeneres, RuPaul, Katy Perry. I felt the satisfaction of a gamer who successfully levels up—achievement unlocked! The video’s final frame sends viewers to Swift’s change.org petition in support of the Equality Act, which has acquired more than 400,000 signatures—including those of Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O’Rourke, and Kirsten Gillibrand—or four times the number required to elicit an official response from the White House.\n\n“MAYBE A YEAR OR TWO AGO, Todrick and I are in the car, and he asked me, What would you do if your son was gay?”\n\nWe are upstairs in Swift’s secret garden, comfortably ensconced in a human-scale basket that is sort of shaped like a cocoon. Swift has brought up an ornate charcuterie board and is happily slathering triple-cream Brie onto sea-salt crackers. “The fact that he had to ask me . . . shocked me and made me realize that I had not made my position clear enough or loud enough,” she says. “If my son was gay, he’d be gay. I don’t understand the question.”\n\nI have pressed Swift on this topic, and her answers have been direct, not performative or scripted. I do sense that she enjoys talking to me about as much as she’d enjoy a root canal—but she’s unfailingly polite, and when we turn to music, her face will light up and she will add little melodic phrases to her speech, clearly her preferred language.\n“Rights are being stripped from basically everyone who isn’t a straight white cisgender male,” Swift says.\n“If he was thinking that, I can’t imagine what my fans in the LGBTQ community might be thinking,” she goes on. “It was kind of devastating to realize that I hadn’t been publicly clear about that.”\n\nI understand why she was surprised; she has been sending pro-LGBTQ signals since at least 2011. Many have been subtle, but none insignificant—especially for a young country star coming out of Nashville.\n\nIn the video for her single “Mean” (from 2010’s Speak Now), we see a boy in a school locker room wearing a lavender sweater and bow tie, surrounded by football players. In “Welcome to New York,” the first track on 1989, she sings, “And you can want who you want. Boys and boys and girls and girls.” Two years later, she donated to a fund for the newly created Stonewall National Monument and presented Ruby Rose with a GLAAD Media Award. Every night of last year’s Reputation tour, she dedicated the song “Dress” to Loie Fuller, the openly gay pioneer of modern dance and theatrical lighting who captured the imagination of fin-de-siècle Paris.\n\nSwift, who has been criticized for keeping her politics to herself, first took an explicit stance a month before the 2018 midterms. On Instagram, she endorsed Democrats for the Tennessee Legislature and called out the Republican running for Senate, Marsha Blackburn. “She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples,” Swift wrote. “She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values.”\n\nSwift says the post was partly to help young fans understand that if they wanted to vote, they had to register. To tell them, as she puts it, “Hey, just so you know, you can’t just roll up.” Some 65,000 new voters registered in the first 24 hours after her post, according to Vote.org.\n\nTrump came to Blackburn’s defense the following day. “She’s a tremendous woman,” he told reporters. “I’m sure Taylor Swift doesn’t know anything about her. Let’s say I like Taylor’s music about 25 percent less now, OK?”\n\nIn April, spurred by a raft of anti-LGBTQ bills in Tennessee, Swift donated $113,000 to the Tennessee Equality Project, which advocates for LGBTQ rights. “Horrendous,” she says of the legislation. “They don’t call it ‘Slate of Hate’ for nothing.” Swift especially liked that the Tennessee Equality Project had organized a petition of faith leaders in opposition. “I loved how smart it was to come at it from a religious perspective.”\n\nMeanwhile, the “Calm Down” video provoked a Colorado pastor to call Swift “a sinner in desperate need of a savior” and warn that “God will cut her down.” It also revived heated debate within LGBTQ communities about the politics of allyship and corporatization of Pride. Some critics argued Swift’s pro-LGBTQ imagery and lyrics were overdue and out of the blue—a reaction the new Swift scholar in me found bewildering. Had they not been paying attention?\n\nLater this year, Swift will appear in the film adaptation of Cats—as the flirtatious Bombalurina. Givenchy dress. \nNor did it strike me as out of character for Swift to leverage her power for a cause. She pulled her catalog from Spotify in 2014 over questions of artist compensation. She stared down Apple in 2015, when the company said it would not pay artists during the launch of its music service. (Apple reversed itself immediately.) As a condition of her record deal with Universal Music Group last year, the company promised that it would distribute proceeds from any sale of its Spotify shares to all of its artists. And this summer, Swift furiously called out Scott Borchetta, founder of Big Machine Label Group, for selling her master recordings to the music manager Scooter Braun. (When I ask Swift if she tried to get her masters from Big Machine, her whole body slumps with a palpable heaviness. “It was either investing in my past or my and other artists’ future, and I chose the future,” she says of the deal she struck with Universal.)\n\nSwift’s blunt testimony during her 2017 sexual-assault case against a radio DJ—months before the #MeToo reckoning blew open—felt deeply political to me and, I imagine, many other women. Swift accused the DJ, David Mueller, of groping her under her skirt at a photo session in 2013. Her camp reported the incident to his employer, who fired him. Mueller denied the allegation, sued Swift for $3 million, and his case was thrown out. Swift countersued for a symbolic $1 and won.\n\nIn a Colorado courtroom, Swift described the incident: “He stayed latched onto my bare ass cheek” as photos were being snapped. Asked why photos of the front of her skirt didn’t show this, she said, “Because my ass is located at the back of my body.” Asked if she felt bad about the DJ’s losing his job, she said, “I’m not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault. Here we are years later, and I’m being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are the product of his decisions—not mine.”\n\nWhen Time included Swift on the cover of its “Silence Breakers” issue that year, the magazine asked how she felt during the testimony. “I was angry,” she said. “In that moment, I decided to forgo any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened...I’m told it was the most amount of times the word ass has ever been said in Colorado Federal Court.”\n\nMueller has since paid Swift the dollar—with a Sacagawea coin. “He was trolling me, implying that I was self-righteous and hell-bent on angry, vengeful feminism. That’s what I’m inferring from him giving me a Sacagawea coin,” Swift says. “Hey, maybe he was trying to do it in honor of a powerful Native American woman. I didn’t ask.” Where is the coin now? “My lawyer has it.”\n\nWatch Taylor Swift Take Over Go Ask Anna:\n\nI ask her, why get louder about LGBTQ rights now? “Rights are being stripped from basically everyone who isn’t a straight white cisgender male,” she says. “I didn’t realize until recently that I could advocate for a community that I’m not a part of. It’s hard to know how to do that without being so fearful of making a mistake that you just freeze. Because my mistakes are very loud. When I make a mistake, it echoes through the canyons of the world. It’s clickbait, and it’s a part of my life story, and it’s a part of my career arc.”\n\n\nI’d argue that no heterosexual woman can listen to “You Need to Calm Down” and hear only a gay anthem. “Calm down” is what controlling men tell women who are angry, contrary, or “hysterical,” or, let’s say, fearing for their physical safety. It is what Panic! at the Disco singer Brendon Urie says to Swift in the beginning of the “ME!” music video, prompting her to scream, “Je suis calme!”\n\nI cannot believe it is a coincidence that Swift, a numbers geek with an affinity for dates, dropped the single—whose slow, incessant bass is likely to be bumping in stadiums across the world in 2020 if she goes on tour—on June 14, a certain president’s birthday.\n\nIT'S ENLIGHTENING to read 13 years of Taylor Swift coverage—all the big reviews, all the big profiles—in one sitting. You notice things.\n\nHow quickly Swift went from a “prodigy” (The New Yorker) and a “songwriting savant” (Rolling Stone) to a tabloid fixture, for instance. Or how suspect her ambition is made to seem once she acquires real power.\n\nOther plot points simply look different in the light of #MeToo. It is hard to imagine that Swift’s songs about her exes would be reviewed as sensationally today. I wonder if, in 2019, any man would dare grab the microphone out of a young woman’s hands at an awards show. I stared into space for a good long while when I was reminded that Pitchfork did not review Taylor Swift’s 1989 but did review Ryan Adams’s cover album of Taylor Swift’s 1989.\n\nI ask Swift if she had always been aware of sexism. “I think about this a lot,” she says. “When I was a teenager, I would hear people talk about sexism in the music industry, and I’d be like, I don’t see it. I don’t understand. Then I realized that was because I was a kid. Men in the industry saw me as a kid. I was a lanky, scrawny, overexcited young girl who reminded them more of their little niece or their daughter than a successful woman in business or a colleague. The second I became a woman, in people’s perception, was when I started seeing it.\n\n“It’s fine to infantilize a girl’s success and say, How cute that she’s having some hit songs,” she goes on. “How cute that she’s writing songs. But the second it becomes formidable? As soon as I started playing stadiums—when I started to look like a woman—that wasn’t as cool anymore. It was when I started to have songs from Red come out and cross over, like ‘I Knew You Were Trouble’ and ‘We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.’ ”\n\nThose songs are also more assertive than the ones that came before, I say. “Yeah, the angle was different when I started saying, I knew you were trouble when you walked in. Basically, you emotionally manipulated me and I didn’t love it. That wasn’t fun for me.”\n\nI have to wonder if having her songwriting overlooked as her hits were picked apart and scrutinized wasn’t the biggest bummer of all. Swift: “I wanted to say to people, You realize writing songs is an art and a craft and not, like, an easy thing to do? Or to do well? People would act like it was a weapon I was using. Like a cheap dirty trick. Be careful, bro, she’ll write a song about you. Don’t stand near her. First of all, that’s not how it works. Second of all, find me a time when they say that about a male artist: Be careful, girl, he’ll use his experience with you to get—God forbid—inspiration to make art.”\n\nWithout question the tenor of the Taylor Swift Narrative changed most dramatically in July 2016, when Kim Kardashian West called her a “snake” on Twitter, and released video clips of Swift and Kanye West discussing the lyrics to his song “Famous.” (No need to rehash the details here. Suffice it to say that Swift’s version of events hasn’t changed: She knew about some of the lyrics but not others; specifically, the words that bitch.) The posts sparked several hashtags, including #TaylorSwiftIsASnake and #TaylorSwiftIsCanceled, which quickly escalated into a months-long campaign to “cancel” Swift.\n\nTo this day Swift doesn’t think people grasp the repercussions of that term. “A mass public shaming, with millions of people saying you are quote-unquote canceled, is a very isolating experience,” she says. “I don’t think there are that many people who can actually understand what it’s like to have millions of people hate you very loudly.” She adds: “When you say someone is canceled, it’s not a TV show. It’s a human being. You’re sending mass amounts of messaging to this person to either shut up, disappear, or it could also be perceived as, Kill yourself.”\n\nMOST POPULAR\nThe Bride Wore Carolina Herrera for Her Paris Wedding That Included Midnight Museum Tours and an All-Night Disco\nWEDDINGS\nThe Bride Wore Carolina Herrera for Her Paris Wedding That Included Midnight Museum Tours and an All-Night Disco\nBY ALEXANDRA MACON\n\nThe Bride Wore 7 Luisa Beccaria Dresses to Marry at Her Family’s Estate in Sicily\nWEDDINGS\nThe Bride Wore 7 Luisa Beccaria Dresses to Marry at Her Family’s Estate in Sicily\nBY ALEXANDRA MACON\n\nAlison Roman and Max Cantor’s Wedding Was a Love Letter to New York City&-And Its Many Restaurants\nWEDDINGS\nAlison Roman and Max Cantor’s Wedding Was a Love Letter to New York City—And Its Many Restaurants\nBY ELISE TAYLOR\n\nAn overhaul was in order. “I realized I needed to restructure my life because it felt completely out of control,” Swift says. “I knew immediately I needed to make music about it because I knew it was the only way I could survive it. It was the only way I could preserve my mental health and also tell the story of what it’s like to go through something so humiliating.”\n\nImage may contain Clothing Apparel Human Person Shoe Footwear Robe Gown Evening Dress Fashion and Female\nState of Grace\nDior bodysuit and skirt.\nPhotographed by Inez & Vinoodh, Vogue, September 2019\nI get a sense of the whiplash Swift experienced when I notice that, a few months into this ordeal, while she was writing the songs that would become her album Reputation—and fighting off Mueller’s lawsuit—a portion of the media and internet began demanding to know why she hadn’t un-canceled herself long enough to take a position in the presidential election.\n\nOn that: “Unfortunately in the 2016 election you had a political opponent who was weaponizing the idea of the celebrity endorsement. He was going around saying, I’m a man of the people. I’m for you. I care about you. I just knew I wasn’t going to help. Also, you know, the summer before that election, all people were saying was She’s calculated. She’s manipulative. She’s not what she seems. She’s a snake. She’s a liar. These are the same exact insults people were hurling at Hillary. Would I be an endorsement or would I be a liability? Look, snakes of a feather flock together. Look, the two lying women. The two nasty women. Literally millions of people were telling me to disappear. So I disappeared. In many senses.”\nSwift previewed Reputation in August 2017 with “Look What You Made Me Do.” The single came with a lyric video whose central image was an ouroboros—a snake swallowing its own tail, an ancient symbol for continual renewal. Swift wiped her social-media feeds clean and began posting video snippets of a slithering snake. The song was pure bombast and high camp. (Lest there be any doubt, the chorus was an interpolation of a ’90s camp classic, Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy.”) Nonetheless, most critics read it as a grenade lobbed in the general direction of Calabasas.\n\nOne longtime Nashville critic, Brian Mansfield, had a more plausible take: She was writing sarcastically as the “Taylor Swift” portrayed in the media in a bid for privacy. “Yeah, this is the character you created for me, let me just hide behind it,” she says now of the persona she created. “I always used this metaphor when I was younger. I’d say that with every reinvention, I never wanted to tear down my house. ’Cause I built this house. This house being, metaphorically, my body of work, my songwriting, my music, my catalog, my library. I just wanted to redecorate. I think a lot of people, with Reputation, would have perceived that I had torn down the house. Actually, I just built a bunker around it.”\n\nIN MARCH, the snakes started to morph into butterflies, the vampire color palette into Easter pastels. When a superbloom of wildflowers lured a mesmerizing deluge of Painted Lady butterflies to Los Angeles, Swift marked it with an Instagram post. She attended the iHeartRadio Music Awards that night in a sequin romper and stilettos with shimmery wings attached.\n\nSwift announced the single “ME!” a month later, with a large butterfly mural in Nashville. In the music video for the (conspicuously) bubblegum song, a hissing pastel-pink snake explodes into a kaleidoscope of butterflies. One flutters by the window of an apartment, where Swift is arguing in French with Urie. A record player is playing in the background. “It’s an old-timey, 1940s-sounding instrumental version of ‘You Need to Calm Down,’ ’’ Swift says. Later, in the “Calm Down” video, Swift wears a (fake) back tattoo of a snake swarmed by butterflies.\n\nMOST POPULAR\nThe Bride Wore Carolina Herrera for Her Paris Wedding That Included Midnight Museum Tours and an All-Night Disco\nWEDDINGS\nThe Bride Wore Carolina Herrera for Her Paris Wedding That Included Midnight Museum Tours and an All-Night Disco\nBY ALEXANDRA MACON\n\nThe Bride Wore 7 Luisa Beccaria Dresses to Marry at Her Family’s Estate in Sicily\nWEDDINGS\nThe Bride Wore 7 Luisa Beccaria Dresses to Marry at Her Family’s Estate in Sicily\nBY ALEXANDRA MACON\n\nAlison Roman and Max Cantor’s Wedding Was a Love Letter to New York City&-And Its Many Restaurants\nWEDDINGS\nAlison Roman and Max Cantor’s Wedding Was a Love Letter to New York City—And Its Many Restaurants\nBY ELISE TAYLOR\n\nWe are only two songs in, people.

One of the reasons why I didn’t do interviews for Reputation was that I couldn’t figure out how I felt hour to hour. Sometimes I felt like: All these things taught me something that I never could have learned in a way that didn’t hurt as much. Five minutes later, I’d feel like: That was horrible. Why did that have to happen? What am I supposed to take from this other than mass amounts of humiliation? And then five minutes later I’d think: I think I might be happier than I’ve ever been.”\n\nShe goes on: “It’s so strange trying to be self-aware when you’ve been cast as this always smiling, always happy ‘America’s sweetheart’ thing, and then having that taken away and realizing that it’s actually a great thing that it was taken away, because that’s extremely limiting.” Swift leans back in the cocoon and smiles: “We’re not going to go straight to gratitude with it. Ever. But we’re going to find positive aspects to it. We’re never going to write a thank-you note.”\n\nThough people will take the Perry-Swift burger-and-fries embrace in the “You Need to Calm Down” video as a press release that the two have mended fences, Swift says it’s actually a comment on how the media pits female pop stars against one another. After Perry sent Swift an (actual) olive branch last year, Swift asked her to be in the video: “She wrote back, This makes me so emotional. I’m so up for this. I want us to be that example. But let’s spend some time together. Because I want it to be real. So she came over and we talked for hours.\n\n“We decided the metaphor for what happens in the media,” Swift explains, “is they pick two people and it’s like they’re pouring gasoline all over the floor. All that needs to happen is one false move, one false word, one misunderstanding, and a match is lit and dropped. That’s what happened with us. It was: Who’s better? Katy or Taylor? Katy or Taylor? Katy or Taylor? Katy or Taylor? The tension is so high that it becomes impossible for you to not think that the other person has something against you.\"\n\nMOST POPULAR\nThe Bride Wore Carolina Herrera for Her Paris Wedding That Included Midnight Museum Tours and an All-Night Disco\nWEDDINGS\nThe Bride Wore Carolina Herrera for Her Paris Wedding That Included Midnight Museum Tours and an All-Night Disco\nBY ALEXANDRA MACON\n\nThe Bride Wore 7 Luisa Beccaria Dresses to Marry at Her Family’s Estate in Sicily\nWEDDINGS\nThe Bride Wore 7 Luisa Beccaria Dresses to Marry at Her Family’s Estate in Sicily\nBY ALEXANDRA MACON\n\nAlison Roman and Max Cantor’s Wedding Was a Love Letter to New York City&-And Its Many Restaurants\nWEDDINGS\nAlison Roman and Max Cantor’s Wedding Was a Love Letter to New York City—And Its Many Restaurants\nBY ELISE TAYLOR\n\nMeanwhile, the protesters in the video reference a real-life religious group that pickets outside Swift’s concerts, not the white working class in general, as some have assumed. “So many artists have them at their shows, and it’s such a confounding, confusing, infuriating thing to have outside of joyful concerts,” she tells me. “Obviously I don’t want to mention the actual entity, because they would get excited about that. Giving them press is not on my list of priorities.”\n\nAt one point, Swift asks if I would like to hear two other songs off the new album. (Duh.) First she plays “Lover,” the title track, coproduced by Jack Antonoff. “This has one of my favorite bridges,” she says. “I love a bridge, and I was really able to go to Bridge City.” It’s a romantic, haunting, waltzy, singer-songwritery nugget: classic Swift. “My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue,” she sings. “All’s well that ends well to end up with you.”\n\nNext, Swift cues up a track that “plays with the idea of perception.” She has often wondered how she would be written and spoken about if she were a man, “so I wrote a song called ‘The Man.’ ” It’s a thought experiment of sorts: “If I had made all the same choices, all the same mistakes, all the same accomplishments, how would it read?” Seconds later, Swift’s earpods are pumping a synth-pop earworm into my head: “I’d be a fearless leader. I’d be an alpha type. When everyone believes ya: What’s that like?”\n\nSwift wrote the first two singles with Joel Little, best known as one of Lorde’s go-to producers. (“From a pop-songwriting point of view, she’s the pinnacle,” Little says of Swift.) The album is likely to include more marquee names. A portrait of the Dixie Chicks in the background of the “ME!” video almost certainly portends a collaboration. If fans are correctly reading a button affixed to her denim jacket in a recent magazine cover, we can expect one with Drake, too.\n\nThis image may contain Clothing Apparel Sleeve Long Sleeve Sweater Human Person and Taylor Swift\nEyes On Her\nDesigner Stella McCartney on her friendship with Swift: “In London we’ll go on walks and talk about everything—life and love.”\nStella McCartney coat.\nIn this story: hair, Christiaan; makeup, Fulvia Farolfi.\nPhotographed by Inez & Vinoodh, Vogue, September 2019\nMOST POPULAR\nThe Bride Wore Carolina Herrera for Her Paris Wedding That Included Midnight Museum Tours and an All-Night Disco\nWEDDINGS\nThe Bride Wore Carolina Herrera for Her Paris Wedding That Included Midnight Museum Tours and an All-Night Disco\nBY ALEXANDRA MACON\n\nThe Bride Wore 7 Luisa Beccaria Dresses to Marry at Her Family’s Estate in Sicily\nWEDDINGS\nThe Bride Wore 7 Luisa Beccaria Dresses to Marry at Her Family’s Estate in Sicily\nBY ALEXANDRA MACON\n\nAlison Roman and Max Cantor’s Wedding Was a Love Letter to New York City&-And Its Many Restaurants\nWEDDINGS\nAlison Roman and Max Cantor’s Wedding Was a Love Letter to New York City—And Its Many Restaurants\nBY ELISE TAYLOR\n\nShe recently announced a fashion collection with Stella McCartney to coincide with Lover. “We met at one of her shows,” says McCartney, “and then we had a girls’ night and kind of jumped straight in. In London we’ll go on walks and talk about everything—life and love.” (Swift has no further fashion ambitions at the moment. “I really love my job right now,” she tells me. “My focus is on music.”) Oh, and that “5” on the bullseye? Track five is called “The Archer.”\n\nYet something tells me the most illuminating clue for reading both Lover and Reputation may be Loie Fuller, the dancer to whom Swift paid homage on tour. As Swift noted on a Jumbotron, Fuller “fought for artists to own their work.” Fuller also used swirling fabric and colored lights to metamorphose onstage, playing a “hide-and-seek illusionist game” with her audience, as one writer has put it. She became a muse to the Symbolists in Paris, where Jean Cocteau wrote that she created “the phantom of an era.” The effect, said the poet Stéphane Mallarmé, was a “dizziness of soul made visible by an artifice.” Fuller’s most famous piece was “Serpentine Dance.” Another was “Butterfly Dance.”\n\nSWIFT HAS HAD almost no downtime since late 2017, but what little she does have is divided among New York, Nashville, Los Angeles, and Rhode Island, where she keeps homes—plus London. In an essay earlier this year, she revealed that her mother, Andrea Swift, is fighting cancer for a second time. “There was a relapse that happened,” Swift says, declining to go into detail. “It’s something that my family is going through.”\n\nLater this year, she will star in a film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cats as Bombalurina, the flirtatious red cat. “They made us the size of cats by making the furniture bigger,” she says. “You’d be standing there and you could barely reach the seat of a chair. It was phenomenal. It made you feel like a little kid.”\n\nBut first, she will spend much of the summer holding “secret sessions”—a tradition wherein Swift invites hundreds of fans to her various homes to preview her new music. “They’ve never given me a reason to stop doing it,” she says. “Not a single one.”\n\nSpeaking of: Inquiring fans will want to know if Swift dropped any more clues about how to decode Lover during this interview. For you I reviewed the audio again, and there were a few things that made my newly acquired Swifty sense tingle.\n\nAt one point she compared superstardom in the digital age to life in a dollhouse, one where voyeurs “can ‘ship’ you with who they want to ‘ship’ you with, and they can ‘favorite’ friends that you have, and they can know where you are all the time.” The metaphor was precise and vivid and, well, a little too intricately rendered to be off the cuff. (Also, the “ME!” lyric: “Baby doll, when it comes to a lover. I promise that you’ll never find another like me.”)\n\nThen there was the balloon—a giant gold balloon in the shape of a numeral seven that happened to float by while we were on her roof, on this, the occasion of her seventh album. “Is it an L’?” I say. “No, because look, the string is hanging from the bottom,” she says.\n\nIt might seem an obvious symbolic gesture, deployed for this interview, except for how impossible that seems. Swift let me control the timing of nearly everything. Moreover, the gold seven wasn’t floating up from the sidewalk below. It was already high in the sky, drifting slowly toward us from down the street. She would have had to control the wind, or at least to have studied it. Would Taylor Swift really go to such elaborate lengths for her fans? This much I know: Yes, she would.",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Partial] “Well, we have been on really good terms for awhile, like, she sent this beautiful note and an olive branch to me the opening night of the Reputation Stadium Tour awhile ago. And from then on, we’ve been on good terms and we hadn’t seen each other, though. So the first time we saw each other was at this party and when we saw each other, it was just very clear to both of us that everything was different. That we had grown up. That we had grown past allowing ourselves to sort of be pitted against each other. It just was really, really clear that we remembered how much we had in common. So both of us have been in really good place for awhile, but we didn’t–I don’t know if either of us knew if we were gonna talk about it publicly. So when I thought of this concept for the video and I wrote the treatment, I thought of this idea, and I thought, you know, I’m just gonna ask her if she’d be interested in this, but I would be totally fine if she’d rather keep it private and keep it between us. But I sent it to her and, you know, she was like, I would love for us to be a symbol of redemption and forgiveness! And I felt the same way about it…[about the text she sent to Katy] Basically, it was like a long synopsis of the entire video. And I didn't think of the burger and fries costume until she wore the burger–she wore that Jeremy burger to the Met Gala after party, and I was like ‘that is amazing’. It felt very punk-rock to me, like her wearing that, like that's really, really cool and funny. I kept thinking, you know, we are gonna have this moment in the video and if it’s too on the nose, if it’s too us wearing normal clothes and hugging, it won’t really fit into this video because this video is very wacky and very surreal and fun and playful. So I was like, can we do a burger and fries as like a metaphor for two people who belong together? And people who are like a a perfect pair? And she thought it was really funny! So we did it. And I think that the metaphor of us being like, you know, searching for someone you have something in common with and seeing them having it be originally represented is funny.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: The Rolling Stone Interview\nIn her most in-depth and introspective interview in years, Swift tells all about the rocky road to 'Lover' and much, much more\n\nBy Brian Hiatt\n\nErik Madigan Heck for Rolling Stone\nSeptember 18, 2019\n\nTaylor Swift bursts into her mom’s Nashville kitchen, smiling, looking remarkably like Taylor Swift. (That red-lip, classic thing? Check.) “I need someone to help dye my hair pink,” she says, and moments later, her ends match her sparkly nail polish, sneakers, and the stripes on her button-down. It’s all in keeping with the pastel aesthetic of her new album, Lover; black-leather combat-Taylor from her previous album cycle has handed back the phone. Around the black-granite kitchen island, all is calm and normal, as Swift’s mom, dad, and younger brother pass through. Her mom’s two dogs, one very small, one very large, pounce upon visitors with slurping glee. It could be any 29-year-old’s weekend visit with her parents, if not for the madness looming a few feet down the hall.\n\nIn an airy terrace, 113 giddy, weepy, shaky, still-in-disbelief fans are waiting for the start of one of Swift’s secret sessions, sacred rituals in Swift-dom. She’s about to play them her seventh album, as-yet unreleased on this Sunday afternoon in early August, and offer copious commentary. Also, she made cookies. Just before the session, Swift sits down in her mom’s study (where she “operates the Google,” per her daughter) to chat for a few minutes. The black-walled room is decorated with black-and-white classic-rock photos, including shots of Bruce Springsteen and, unsurprisingly, James Taylor; there are also more recent shots of Swift posing with Kris Kristofferson and playing with Def Leppard, her mom’s favorite band.\n\nIn a corner is an acoustic guitar Swift played as a teenager. She almost certainly wrote some well-known songs on it, but can’t recall which ones. “It would be kind of weird to finish a song and be like, ‘And this moment, I shall remember,’'” she says, laughing. “‘This guitar hath been anointed with my sacred tuneage!'”\n\nThe secret session itself is, as the name suggests, deeply off-the-record; it can be confirmed that she drank some white wine, since her glass pops up in some Instagram pictures. She stays until 5 a.m., chatting and taking photos with every one of the fans. Five hours later, we continue our talk at length in Swift’s Nashville condo, in almost exactly the same spot where we did one of our interviews for her 2012 Rolling Stone cover story. She’s hardly changed its whimsical decor in the past seven years (one of the few additions is a pool table replacing the couch where we sat last time), so it’s an old-Taylor time capsule. There’s still a huge bunny made of moss in one corner, and a human-size birdcage in the living room, though the view from the latter is now of generic new condo buildings instead of just distant green hills. Swift is barefoot now, in pale-blue jeans and a blue button-down tied at the waist; her hair is pulled back, her makeup minimal.\n\n\nHow to sum up the past three years of Taylor Swift? In July 2016, after Swift expressed discontent with Kanye West’s “Famous,” Kim Kardashian did her best to destroy her, unleashing clandestine recordings of a phone conversation between Swift and West. In the piecemeal audio, Swift can be heard agreeing to the line “…me and Taylor might still have sex.” We don’t hear her learning about the next lyric, the one she says bothered her — “I made that bitch famous” — and as she’ll explain, there’s more to her side of the story. The backlash was, well, swift, and overwhelming. It still hasn’t altogether subsided. Later that year, Swift chose not to make an endorsement in the 2016 election, which definitely didn’t help. In the face of it all, she made Reputation — fierce, witty, almost-industrial pop offset by love songs of crystalline beauty — and had a wildly successful stadium tour. Somewhere in there, she met her current boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, and judging by certain songs on Lover, the relationship is serious indeed.\n\nLover is Swift’s most adult album, a rebalancing of sound and persona that opens doors to the next decade of her career; it’s also a welcome return to the sonic diversity of 2012’s Red, with tracks ranging from the St. Vincent-assisted über-bop “Cruel Summer” to the unbearably poignant country-fied “Soon You’ll Get Better” (with the Dixie Chicks) and the “Shake It Off”-worthy pep of “Paper Rings.”\n\nShe wants to talk about the music, of course, but she is also ready to explain the past three years of her life, in depth, for the first time. The conversation is often not a light one. She’s built up more armor in the past few years, but still has the opposite of a poker face — you can see every micro-emotion wash over her as she ponders a question, her nose wrinkling in semi-ironic offense at the term “old-school pop stars,” her preposterously blue eyes glistening as she turns to darker subjects. In her worst moments, she says, “You feel like you’re being completely pulled into a riptide. So what are you going to do? Splash a lot? Or hold your breath and hope you somehow resurface? And that’s what I did. And it took three years. Sitting here doing an interview — the fact that we’ve done an interview before is the only reason I’m not in a full body sweat.”\n\n\nWhen we talked seven years ago, everything was going so well for you, and you were very worried that something would go wrong.\nYeah, I kind of knew it would. I felt like I was walking along the sidewalk, knowing eventually the pavement was going to crumble and I was gonna fall through. You can’t keep winning and have people like it. People love “new” so much — they raise you up the flagpole, and you’re waving at the top of the flagpole for a while. And then they’re like, “Wait, this new flag is what we actually love.” They decide something you’re doing is incorrect, that you’re not standing for what you should stand for. You’re a bad example. Then if you keep making music and you survive, and you keep connecting with people, eventually they raise you a little bit up the flagpole again, and then they take you back down, and back up again. And it happens to women more than it happens to men in music.\n\nIt also happened to you a few times on a smaller scale, didn’t it?\nI’ve had several upheavals in my career. When I was 18, they were like, “She doesn’t really write those songs.” So my third album I wrote by myself as a reaction to that. Then they decided I was a serial dater — a boy-crazy man-eater — when I was 22. And so I didn’t date anyone for, like, two years. And then they decided in 2016 that absolutely everything about me was wrong. If I did something good, it was for the wrong reasons. If I did something brave, I didn’t do it correctly. If I stood up for myself, I was throwing a tantrum. And so I found myself in this endless mockery echo chamber. It’s just like — I have a brother who’s two and a half years younger, and we spent the first half of our lives trying to kill each other and the second half as best friends. You know that game kids play? I’d be like, “Mom, can I have some water?” And Austin would be like, “Mom, can I have some water?” And I’m like, “He’s copying me.” And he’d be like, “He’s copying me.” Always in a really obnoxious voice that sounds all twisted. That’s what it felt like in 2016. So I decided to just say nothing. It wasn’t really a decision. It was completely involuntary.\n\n\nBut you also had good things happen in your life at the same time — that’s part of Reputation.\nThe moments of my true story on that album are songs like “Delicate,” “New Year’s Day,” “Call It What You Want,” “Dress.” The one-two punch, bait-and-switch of Reputation is that it was actually a love story. It was a love story in amongst chaos. All the weaponized sort of metallic battle anthems were what was going on outside. That was the battle raging on that I could see from the windows, and then there was what was happening inside my world — my newly quiet, cozy world that was happening on my own terms for the first time. . . . It’s weird, because in some of the worst times of my career, and reputation, dare I say, I had some of the most beautiful times — in my quiet life that I chose to have. And I had some of the most incredible memories with the friends I now knew cared about me, even if everyone hated me. The bad stuff was really significant and damaging. But the good stuff will endure. The good lessons — you realize that you can’t just show your life to people.\n\nMeaning?\nI used to be like a golden retriever, just walking up to everybody, like, wagging my tail. “Sure, yeah, of course! What do you want to know? What do you need?” Now, I guess, I have to be a little bit more like a fox.\n\nDo your regrets on that extend to the way the “girl squad” thing was perceived?\nYeah, I never would have imagined that people would have thought, “This is a clique that wouldn’t have accepted me if I wanted to be in it.” Holy shit, that hit me like a ton of bricks. I was like, “Oh, this did not go the way that I thought it was going to go.” I thought it was going to be we can still stick together, just like men are allowed to do. The patriarchy allows men to have bro packs. If you’re a male artist, there’s an understanding that you have respect for your counterparts.\n\nWhereas women are expected to be feuding with each other?\nIt’s assumed that we hate each other. Even if we’re smiling and photographed together with our arms around each other, it’s assumed there’s a knife in our pocket.\n\n\nHow much of a danger was there of falling into that thought pattern yourself?\nThe messaging is dangerous, yes. Nobody is immune, because we’re a product of what society and peer groups and now the internet tells us, unless we learn differently from experience.\n\nYou once sang about a star who “took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.” In 2016, you wrote in your journal, “This summer is the apocalypse.” How close did you come to quitting altogether?\nI definitely thought about that a lot. I thought about how words are my only way of making sense of the world and expressing myself — and now any words I say or write are being twisted against me. People love a hate frenzy. It’s like piranhas. People had so much fun hating me, and they didn’t really need very many reasons to do it. I felt like the situation was pretty hopeless. I wrote a lot of really aggressively bitter poems constantly. I wrote a lot of think pieces that I knew I’d never publish, about what it’s like to feel like you’re in a shame spiral. And I couldn’t figure out how to learn from it. Because I wasn’t sure exactly what I did that was so wrong. That was really hard for me, because I cannot stand it when people can’t take criticism. So I try to self-examine, and even though that’s really hard and hurts a lot sometimes, I really try to understand where people are coming from when they don’t like me. And I completely get why people wouldn’t like me. Because, you know, I’ve had my insecurities say those things — and things 1,000 times worse.\n\nBut some of your former critics have become your friends, right?\nSome of my best friendships came from people publicly criticizing me and then it opening up a conversation. Hayley Kiyoko was doing an interview and she made an example about how I get away with singing about straight relationships and people don’t give me shit the way they give her shit for singing about girls — and it’s totally valid. Like, Ella — Lorde — the first thing she ever said about me publicly was a criticism of my image or whatever. But I can’t really respond to someone saying, “You, as a human being, are fake.” And if they say you’re playing the victim, that completely undermines your ability to ever verbalize how you feel unless it’s positive. So, OK, should I just smile all the time and never say anything hurts me? Because that’s really fake. Or should I be real about how I’m feeling and have valid, legitimate responses to things that happened to me in my life? But wait, would that be playing the victim?\n\n\nHow do you escape that mental trap?\nSince I was 15 years old, if people criticized me for something, I changed it. So you realize you might be this amalgamation of criticisms that were hurled at you, and not an actual person who’s made any of these choices themselves. And so I decided I needed to live a quiet life, because a quiet personal life invites no discussion, dissection, and debate. I didn’t realize I was inviting people to feel they had the right to sort of play my life like a video game.\n\n“The old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now. Why? Because she’s dead!” was funny — but how seriously should we take it?\nThere’s a part of me that definitely is always going to be different. I needed to grow up in many ways. I needed to make boundaries, to figure out what was mine and what was the public’s. That old version of me that shares unfailingly and unblinkingly with a world that is probably not fit to be shared with? I think that’s gone. But it was definitely just, like, a fun moment in the studio with me and Jack [Antonoff] where I wanted to play on the idea of a phone call — because that’s how all of this started, a stupid phone call I shouldn’t have picked up.\n\nIt would have been much easier if that’s what you’d just said.\nIt would have been so, so great if I would have just said that [laughs].\n\nSome of the Lover iconography does suggest old Taylor’s return, though.\nI don’t think I’ve ever leaned into the old version of myself more creatively than I have on this album, where it’s very, very autobiographical. But also moments of extreme catchiness and moments of extreme personal confession.\n\nDid you do anything wrong from your perspective in dealing with that phone call? Is there anything you regret?\nThe world didn’t understand the context and the events that led up to it. Because nothing ever just happens like that without some lead-up. Some events took place to cause me to be pissed off when he called me a bitch. That was not just a singular event. Basically, I got really sick of the dynamic between he and I. And that wasn’t just based on what happened on that phone call and with that song — it was kind of a chain reaction of things.\n\n\nI started to feel like we reconnected, which felt great for me — because all I ever wanted my whole career after that thing happened in 2009 was for him to respect me. When someone doesn’t respect you so loudly and says you literally don’t deserve to be here — I just so badly wanted that respect from him, and I hate that about myself, that I was like, “This guy who’s antagonizing me, I just want his approval.” But that’s where I was. And so we’d go to dinner and stuff. And I was so happy, because he would say really nice things about my music. It just felt like I was healing some childhood rejection or something from when I was 19. But the 2015 VMAs come around. He’s getting the Vanguard Award. He called me up beforehand — I didn’t illegally record it, so I can’t play it for you. But he called me up, maybe a week or so before the event, and we had maybe over an hourlong conversation, and he’s like, “I really, really would like for you to present this Vanguard Award to me, this would mean so much to me,” and went into all the reasons why it means so much, because he can be so sweet. He can be the sweetest. And I was so stoked that he asked me that. And so I wrote this speech up, and then we get to the VMAs and I make this speech and he screams, “MTV got Taylor Swift up here to present me this award for ratings!” [His exact words: “You know how many times they announced Taylor was going to give me the award ’cause it got them more ratings?”] And I’m standing in the audience with my arm around his wife, and this chill ran through my body. I realized he is so two-faced. That he wants to be nice to me behind the scenes, but then he wants to look cool, get up in front of everyone and talk shit. And I was so upset. He wanted me to come talk to him after the event in his dressing room. I wouldn’t go. So then he sent this big, big thing of flowers the next day to apologize. And I was like, “You know what? I really don’t want us to be on bad terms again. So whatever, I’m just going to move past this.” So when he gets on the phone with me, and I was so touched that he would be respectful and, like, tell me about this one line in the song.\n\n\nThe line being “. . . me and Taylor might still have sex”?\n[Nods] And I was like, “OK, good. We’re back on good terms.” And then when I heard the song, I was like, “I’m done with this. If you want to be on bad terms, let’s be on bad terms, but just be real about it.” And then he literally did the same thing to Drake. He gravely affected the trajectory of Drake’s family and their lives. It’s the same thing. Getting close to you, earning your trust, detonating you. I really don’t want to talk about it anymore because I get worked up, and I don’t want to just talk about negative shit all day, but it’s the same thing. Go watch Drake talk about what happened. [West denied any involvement in Pusha-T’s revelation of Drake’s child and apologized for sending “negative energy” toward Drake.]\n\nWhen did you get to the place that’s described on the opening track of Lover, “I Forgot That You Existed”?\nIt was sometime on the Reputation tour, which was the most transformative emotional experience of my career. That tour put me in the healthiest, most balanced place I’ve ever been. After that tour, bad stuff can happen to me, but it doesn’t level me anymore. The stuff that happened a couple of months ago with Scott [Borchetta] would have leveled me three years ago and silenced me. I would have been too afraid to speak up. Something about that tour made me disengage from some part of public perception I used to hang my entire identity on, which I now know is incredibly unhealthy.\n\nWhat was the actual revelation?\nIt’s almost like I feel more clear about the fact that my job is to be an entertainer. It’s not like this massive thing that sometimes my brain makes it into, and sometimes the media makes it into, where we’re all on this battlefield and everyone’s gonna die except one person, who wins. It’s like, “No, do you know what? Katy is going to be legendary. Gaga is going to be legendary. Beyoncé is going to be legendary. Rihanna is going to be legendary. Because the work that they made completely overshadows the myopia of this 24-hour news cycle of clickbait.” And somehow I realized that on tour, as I was looking at people’s faces. We’re just entertaining people, and it’s supposed to be fun.\n\n\nIt’s interesting to look at these albums as a trilogy. 1989 was really a reset button.\nOh, in every way. I’ve been very vocal about the fact that that decision was mine and mine alone, and it was definitely met with a lot of resistance. Internally.\n\nAfter realizing that things were not all smiles with your former label boss, Scott Borchetta, it’s hard not to wonder how much additional conflict there was over things like that.\nA lot of the best things I ever did creatively were things that I had to really fight — and I mean aggressively fight — to have happen. But, you know, I’m not like him, making crazy, petty accusations about the past. . . . When you have a business relationship with someone for 15 years, there are going to be a lot of ups and a lot of downs. But I truly, legitimately thought he looked at me as the daughter he never had. And so even though we had a lot of really bad times and creative differences, I was going to hang my hat on the good stuff. I wanted to be friends with him. I thought I knew what betrayal felt like, but this stuff that happened with him was a redefinition of betrayal for me, just because it felt like it was family. To go from feeling like you’re being looked at as a daughter to this grotesque feeling of “Oh, I was actually his prized calf that he was fattening up to sell to the slaughterhouse that would pay the most.”\n\nHe accused you of declining the Parkland march and Manchester benefit show.\nUnbelievable. Here’s the thing: Everyone in my team knew if Scooter Braun brings us something, do not bring it to me. The fact that those two are in business together after the things he said about Scooter Braun — it’s really hard to shock me. And this was utterly shocking. These are two very rich, very powerful men, using $300 million of other people’s money to purchase, like, the most feminine body of work. And then they’re standing in a wood-panel bar doing a tacky photo shoot, raising a glass of scotch to themselves. Because they pulled one over on me and got this done so sneakily that I didn’t even see it coming. And I couldn’t say anything about it.\n\n\nIn some ways, on a musical level, Lover feels like the most indie-ish of your albums.\nThat’s amazing, thank you. It’s definitely a quirky record. With this album, I felt like I sort of gave myself permission to revisit older themes that I used to write about, maybe look at them with fresh eyes. And to revisit older instruments — older in terms of when I used to use them. Because when I was making 1989, I was so obsessed with it being this concept of Eighties big pop, whether it was Eighties in its production or Eighties in its nature, just having these big choruses — being unapologetically big. And then Reputation, there was a reason why I had it all in lowercase. I felt like it wasn’t unapologetically commercial. It’s weird, because that is the album that took the most amount of explanation, and yet it’s the one I didn’t talk about. In the Reputation secret sessions I kind of had to explain to my fans, “I know we’re doing a new thing here that I’d never done before.” I’d never played with characters before. For a lot of pop stars, that’s a really fun trick, where they’re like, “This is my alter ego.” I had never played with that before. It’s really fun. And it was just so fun to play with on tour — the darkness and the bombast and the bitterness and the love and the ups and the downs of an emotional-turmoil record.\n\n“Daylight” is a beautiful song. It feels like it could have been the title track.\nIt almost was. I thought it might be a little bit too sentimental.\n\nAnd I guess maybe too on-the-nose.\nRight, yeah, way too on-the-nose. That’s what I thought, because I was kind of in my head referring to the album as Daylight for a while. But Lover, to me, was a more interesting title, more of an accurate theme in my head, and more elastic as a concept. That’s why “You Need to Calm Down” can make sense within the theme of the album — one of the things it addresses is how certain people are not allowed to live their lives without discrimination just based on who they love.\n\n\nFor the more organic songs on this album, like “Lover” and “Paper Rings,” you said you were imagining a wedding band playing them. How often does that kind of visualization shape a song’s production style?\nSometimes I’ll have a strange sort of fantasy of where the songs would be played. And so for songs like “Paper Rings” or “Lover” I was imagining a wedding-reception band, but in the Seventies, so they couldn’t play instruments that wouldn’t have been invented yet. I have all these visuals. For Reputation, it was nighttime cityscape. I didn’t really want any — or very minimal — traditional acoustic instruments. I imagined old warehouse buildings that had been deserted and factory spaces and all this industrial kind of imagery. So I wanted the production to have nothing wooden. There’s no wood floors on that album. Lover is, like, completely just a barn wood floor and some ripped curtains flowing in the breeze, and fields of flowers and, you know, velvet.\n\nHow did you come to use high school metaphors to touch on politics with “Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince”?\nThere are so many influences that go into that particular song. I wrote it a couple of months after midterm elections, and I wanted to take the idea of politics and pick a metaphorical place for that to exist. And so I was thinking about a traditional American high school, where there’s all these kinds of social events that could make someone feel completely alienated. And I think a lot of people in our political landscape are just feeling like we need to huddle up under the bleachers and figure out a plan to make things better.\n\nI feel like your Fall Out Boy fandom might’ve slipped out in that title.\nI love Fall Out Boy so much. Their songwriting really influenced me, lyrically, maybe more than anyone else. They take a phrase and they twist it. “Loaded God complex/Cock it and pull it”? When I heard that, I was like, “I’m dreaming.”\n\nYou sing about “American stories burning before me.” Do you mean the illusions of what America is?\nIt’s about the illusions of what I thought America was before our political landscape took this turn, and that naivete that we used to have about it. And it’s also the idea of people who live in America, who just want to live their lives, make a living, have a family, love who they love, and watching those people lose their rights, or watching those people feel not at home in their home. I have that line “I see the high-fives between the bad guys” because not only are some really racist, horrific undertones now becoming overtones in our political climate, but the people who are representing those concepts and that way of looking at the world are celebrating loudly, and it’s horrific.\n\n\nYou’re in this weird place of being a blond, blue-eyed pop star in this era — to the point where until you endorsed some Democratic candidates, right-wingers, and worse, assumed you were on their side.\nI don’t think they do anymore. Yeah, that was jarring, and I didn’t hear about that until after it had happened. Because at this point, I, for a very long time, I didn’t have the internet on my phone, and my team and my family were really worried about me because I was not in a good place. And there was a lot of stuff that they just dealt with without telling me about it. Which is the only time that’s ever happened in my career. I’m always in the pilot seat, trying to fly the plane that is my career in exactly the direction I want to take it. But there was a time when I just had to throw my hands up and say, “Guys, I can’t. I can’t do this. I need you to just take over for me and I’m just going to disappear.”\n\nAre you referring to when a white-supremacist site suggested you were on their team?\nI didn’t even see that, but, like, if that happened, that’s just disgusting. There’s literally nothing worse than white supremacy. It’s repulsive. There should be no place for it. Really, I keep trying to learn as much as I can about politics, and it’s become something I’m now obsessed with, whereas before, I was living in this sort of political ambivalence, because the person I voted for had always won. We were in such an amazing time when Obama was president because foreign nations respected us. We were so excited to have this dignified person in the White House. My first election was voting for him when he made it into office, and then voting to re-elect him. I think a lot of people are like me, where they just didn’t really know that this could happen. But I’m just focused on the 2020 election. I’m really focused on it. I’m really focused on how I can help and not hinder. Because I also don’t want it to backfire again, because I do feel that the celebrity involvement with Hillary’s campaign was used against her in a lot of ways.\n\n\nYou took a lot of heat for not getting involved. Does any part of you regret that you just didn’t say “fuck it” and gotten more specific when you said to vote that November?\nTotally. Yeah, I regret a lot of things all the time. It’s like a daily ritual.\n\nWere you just convinced that it would backfire?\nThat’s literally what it was. Yeah. It’s a very powerful thing when you legitimately feel like numbers have proven that pretty much everyone hates you. Like, quantifiably. That’s not me being dramatic. And you know that.\n\nThere were a lot of people in those stadiums.\nIt’s true. But that was two years later. . . . I do think, as a party, we need to be more of a team. With Republicans, if you’re wearing that red hat, you’re one of them. And if we’re going to do anything to change what’s happening, we need to stick together. We need to stop dissecting why someone’s on our side or if they’re on our side in the right way or if they phrased it correctly. We need to not have the right kind of Democrat and the wrong kind of Democrat. We need to just be like, “You’re a Democrat? Sick. Get in the car. We’re going to the mall.”\n\nHere’s a hard question for you: As a superfan, what did you think of the Game of Thrones finale?\nOh, my God. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about this. So, clinically our brain responds to our favorite show ending the same way we feel when a breakup occurs. I read that. There’s no good way for it to end. No matter what would have happened in that finale, people still would have been really upset because of the fact that it’s over.\n\nI was glad to see you confirm that your line about a “list of names” was a reference to Arya.\nI like to be influenced by movies and shows and books and stuff. I love to write about a character dynamic. And not all of my life is going to be as kind of complex as these intricate webs of characters on TV shows and movies.\n\nThere was a time when it was.\nThat’s amazing.\n\n\nBut is the idea that as your own life becomes less dramatic, you’ll need to pull ideas from other places?\nI don’t feel like that yet. I think I might feel like that possibly when I have a family. If I have a family. [Pauses] I don’t know why I said that! But that’s what I’ve heard from other artists, that they were very protective of their personal life, so they had to draw inspiration from other things. But again, I don’t know why I said that. Because I don’t know how my life is going to go or what I’m going to do. But right now, I feel like it’s easier for me to write than it ever was.\n\nYou don’t talk about your relationship, but you’ll sing about it in wildly revealing detail. What’s the difference for you?\nSinging about something helps you to express it in a way that feels more accurate. You cannot, no matter what, put words in a quote and have it move someone the same way as if you heard those words with the perfect sonic representation of that feeling. . . . There is that weird conflict in being a confessional songwriter and then also having my life, you know, 10 years ago, be catapulted into this strange pop-culture thing.\n\nI’ve heard you say that people got too interested in which song was about who, which I can understand — at the same time, to be fair, it was a game you played into, wasn’t it?\nI realized very early on that no matter what, that was going to happen to me regardless. So when you realize the rules of the game you’re playing and how it will affect you, you got to look at the board and make your strategy. But at the same time, writing songs has never been a strategic element of my career. But I’m not scared anymore to say that other things in my career, like how to market an album, are strictly strategic. And I’m sick of women not being able to say that they have strategic business minds — because male artists are allowed to. And so I’m sick and tired of having to pretend like I don’t mastermind my own business. But, it’s a different part of my brain than I use to write.\n\n\nYou’ve been masterminding your business since you were a teenager.\nYeah, but I’ve also tried very hard — and this is one thing I regret — to convince people that I wasn’t the one holding the puppet strings of my marketing existence, or the fact that I sit in a conference room several times a week and come up with these ideas. I felt for a very long time that people don’t want to think of a woman in music who isn’t just a happy, talented accident. We’re all forced to kind of be like, “Aw, shucks, this happened again! We’re still doing well! Aw, that’s so great.” Alex Morgan celebrating scoring a goal at the World Cup and getting shit for it is a perfect example of why we’re not allowed to flaunt or celebrate, or reveal that, like, “Oh, yeah, it was me. I came up with this stuff.” I think it’s really unfair. People love new female artists so much because they’re able to explain that woman’s success. There’s an easy trajectory. Look at the Game of Thrones finale. I specifically really related to Daenerys’ storyline because for me it portrayed that it is a lot easier for a woman to attain power than to maintain it.\n\nI mean, she did murder . . .\nIt’s a total metaphor! Like, obviously I didn’t want Daenerys to become that kind of character, but in taking away what I chose to take away from it, I thought maybe they’re trying to portray her climbing the ladder to the top was a lot easier than maintaining it, because for me, the times when I felt like I was going insane was when I was trying to maintain my career in the same way that I ascended. It’s easier to get power than to keep it. It’s easier to get acclaim than to keep it. It’s easier to get attention than to keep it.\n\nWell, I guess we should be glad you didn’t have a dragon in 2016. . . .\n[Fiercely] I told you I don’t like that she did that! But, I mean, watching the show, though, maybe this is a reflection on how we treat women in power, how we are totally going to conspire against them and tear at them until they feel this — this insane shift, where you wonder, like, “What changed?” And I’ve had that happen, like, 60 times in my career where I’m like, “OK, you liked me last year, what changed? I guess I’ll change so I can keep entertaining you guys.”\n\n\nYou once said that your mom could never punish you when you were little because you’d punish yourself. This idea of changing in the face of criticism and needing approval — that’s all part of wanting to be good, right? Whatever that means. But that seems to be a real driving force in your life.\nYeah, that’s definitely very perceptive of you. And the question posed to me is, if you kept trying to do good things, but everyone saw those things in a cynical way and assumed them to be done with bad motivation and bad intent, would you still do good things, even though nothing that you did was looked at as good? And the answer is, yes. Criticism that’s constructive is helpful to my character growth. Baseless criticism is stuff I’ve got to toss out now.\n\nThat sounds healthy. Is this therapy talking or is this just experience?\nNo, I’ve never been to therapy. I talk to my mom a lot, because my mom is the one who’s seen everything. God, it takes so long to download somebody on the last 29 years of my life, and my mom has seen it all. She knows exactly where I’m coming from. And we talk endlessly. There were times when I used to have really, really, really bad days where we would just be on the phone for hours and hours and hours. I’d write something that I wanted to say, and instead of posting it, I’d just read it to her.\n\nI somehow connect all this to the lyric in “Daylight,” the idea of “so many lines that I’ve crossed unforgiven” — it’s a different kind of confession.\nI am really glad you liked that line, because that’s something that does bother me, looking back at life and realizing that no matter what, you screw things up. Sometimes there are people that were in your life and they’re not anymore — and there’s nothing you can do about it. You can’t fix it, you can’t change it. I told the fans last night that sometimes on my bad days, I feel like my life is a pile of crap accumulated of only the bad headlines or the bad things that have happened, or the mistakes I’ve made or clichés or rumors or things that people think about me or have thought for the last 15 years. And that was part of the “Look What You Made Me Do” music video, where I had a pile of literal old selves fighting each other.\n\n\nBut, yeah, that line is indicative of my anxiety about how in life you can’t get everything right. A lot of times you make the wrong call, make the wrong decision. Say the wrong thing. Hurt people, even if you didn’t mean to. You don’t really know how to fix all of that. When it’s, like, 29 years’ worth.\n\nTo be Mr. “Rolling Stone” for a second, there’s a Springsteen lyric, “Ain’t no one leaving this world, buddy/Without their shirttail dirty or hands a little bloody.”\nThat’s really good! No one gets through it unscathed. No one gets through in one piece. I think that’s a hard thing for a lot of people to grasp. I know it was hard for me, because I kind of grew up thinking, “If I’m nice, and if I try to do the right thing, you know, maybe I can just, like, ace this whole thing.” And it turns out I can’t.\n\nIt’s interesting to look at “I Did Something Bad” in this context.\nYou pointing that out is really interesting because it’s something I’ve had to reconcile within myself in the last couple of years — that sort of “good” complex. Because from the time I was a kid I’d try to be kind, be a good person. Try really hard. But you get walked all over sometimes. And how do you respond to being walked all over? You can’t just sit there and eat your salad and let it happen. “I Did Something Bad” was about doing something that was so against what I would usually do. Katy [Perry] and I were talking about our signs. . . . [Laughs] Of course we were.\n\nThat’s the greatest sentence ever.\n[Laughs] I hate you. We were talking about our signs because we had this really, really long talk when we were reconnecting and stuff. And I remember in the long talk, she was like, “If we had one glass of white wine right now, we’d both be crying.” Because we were drinking tea. We’ve had some really good conversations.\n\nWe were talking about how we’ve had miscommunications with people in the past, not even specifically with each other. She’s like, “I’m a Scorpio. Scorpios just strike when they feel threatened.” And I was like, “Well, I’m an archer. We literally stand back, assess the situation, process how we feel about it, raise a bow, pull it back, and fire.” So it’s completely different ways of processing pain, confusion, misconception. And oftentimes I’ve had this delay in feeling something that hurts me and then saying that it hurts me. Do you know what I mean? And so I can understand how people in my life would have been like, “Whoa, I didn’t know that was how you felt.” Because it takes me a second.\n\n\nIf you watch the video of the 2009 VMAs, I literally freeze. I literally stand there. And that is how I handle any discomfort, any pain. I stand there, I freeze. And then five minutes later, I know how I feel. But in the moment, I’m probably overreacting and I should be nice. Then I process it, and in five minutes, if it’s gone, it’s past, and I’m like, “I was overreacting, everything’s fine. I can get through this. I’m glad I didn’t say anything harsh in the moment.” But when it’s actually something bad that happened, and I feel really, really hurt or upset about it, I only know after the fact. Because I’ve tried so hard to squash it: “This probably isn’t what you think.” That’s something I had to work on.\n\nYou could end up gaslighting yourself.\nYeah, for sure. ’Cause so many situations where if I would have said the first thing that came to my mind, people would have been like, “Whoa!” And maybe I would have been wrong or combative. So a couple of years ago I started working on actually just responding to my emotions in a quicker fashion. And it’s really helped with stuff. It’s helped so much because sometimes you get in arguments. But conflict in the moment is so much better than combat after the fact.\n\nWell, thanks.\nI do feel like I just did a therapy session. As someone who’s never been to therapy, I can safely say that was the best therapy session.",

      "Transcript/Content": "9 Taylor Swift Moments That Didn’t Fit in Our Cover Story\nSwift on writing \"Lover,\" learning to be a dancer, and much more from our cover-story interviews\n\nBy Brian Hiatt\n\nSeptember 30, 2019\n\nTaylor Swift had a lot to say in our recent cover story (on newsstands now), tracing her eventful path to Lover, her political views and many other topics in a lengthy, revealing interview. There was even more to the caffeine-fueled conversation, which Swift made it through on four hours of sleep after staying up greeting fans at her parents’ Nashville house. Here are some highlights:\n\nOn releasing “The Archer” after “Me” and “You Need to Calm Down.” \nThat’s sort of the world in which a lot of the album lives. It’s weird, because in pop, I love hooks and bop and catchy melodies so much. And I also love writing the songs  you need to ugly cry to. So I really enjoy “You Need to Calm Down” and the brattiness of “damn, it’s 7 a.m.,” and then the next song being like, this is how I feel about myself in my lowest moments… It was unexpected when people liked “The Archer” seemingly sort of unanimously, I was like, What? This doesn’t happen to me. This almost feels like foreign and strange.\n\nOn Lover‘s place in her catalog\nReputation was so far from what I usually do. And Lover feels like a return to the fundamental songwriting pillars that I usually build my house on. It’s really honest; it’s not me playing a character. It’s really just how I feel, undistilled. And there are a lot of very personal admissions in it. And also, I love a metaphor. I love building on the metaphor for a very long time. You know, the whole of Reputation was just a metaphor, but this is a very personal record. So that’s been really fun.\n\nWriting the title track of Lover\nI was sitting up at the piano up in my loft, and I had the chorus. It just kind of happened immediately. It was one of those ones that I wrote very very, very quickly. And I was working out the cadence of the first verse and it just sort of fell together. But then I took some time to write the bridge because I wanted to really level up with that bridge. That one would for me would be less of a ranting bridge and more of a story-time fable type bridge. Sometimes I like to imagine a bridge as like a sort of fairy-tale lullaby fable expanding upon a song that has been not as detailed until that point. “Can I go where you go/ Can we always be this close forever and ever”  is less detail then when you go to the bridge and you realize like, oh, it just got really personal in the bridge. It expands on it all.\n\n\n\n\nWriting “Paper Rings”\nWe just were messing around, just wanting to make something really, really fun. And I had all these lyrics about all these funny memories of how something can start off in a really quirky way and surprise you. Like how it says, “I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this.” So I wanted to show the quirkiness of a relationship and how it’s like, wow, this really fell together in really interesting, funny, playful, cute pieces. And now it’s something we’re both really stoked happened exactly the way it did.\n\nOn her creative burst circa 2016\nI was writing constantly. And a lot of the things I was writing ended up being songs for Reputation. So after 1989, I didn’t write really anything. After I made 1989 and put it out, did all the promo stuff, went on tour… The Grammys happen, which is like this unbelievable blitz of excitement, followed by me going, “Oh my god, what am I going to make next?” I had no idea what to make next, because I was so proud. 1989 — I’m still so, so deeply proud of that record. But I was like, where do we go from here? I have no idea what comes after this. And so, when my life took a very dramatic shift, all of a sudden I knew what to make next — which is a strange dichotomy to feel like, ‘whoa, this is all really weird, twisted, dark and dramatic, but I can’t stop writing.’\n\nI think I would have made Reputation whether or not I actually put out the album or ever made another album again. That album was a real process of catharsis, and I thought I experienced catharsis before, but I’d never had until that album, because it was creating this strange defense mechanism. And, I’d never really done that in that exact way before. The only  way I’d done it in the past, was with “Blank Space,” which I wrote specifically about criticisms I had received for supposedly dating too many people in my twenties. I took that template of, OK, this is what you’re all saying about me. Let me just write from this character for a second.\n\nOn the Reputation Tour\nThat’s just such a fun album, Reputation. I’m so proud of how that whole process was because I’d never had an album that made more sense to people after they came to the concert. Literally people would be like, I came to the show and now I completely love the record. Now I get the record. Whereas before with 1989, I felt like it was such a great listen but it was harder to portray it live because when you when you see it live, you’re like, “Oh, I love that song and now she’s performing it live.” But it never had songs that came alive live.\n\n\nWith Reputation, I wanted to keep my head down, not say anything, but work harder than I ever worked. It was really motivational for me to just have the stadium tour to prepare for and prove myself almost. My career was in a weird spot, but still have that kind of ignite something in you to work harder, to practice longer, to think of bigger, better concepts for the live show. I was thinking, if anything can pull me out of  this weird disillusionment I have with the way that things have gone in my career that I was feeling back then, I knew it would be playing live. If I could be proud of the live show and if I could feel that connection with fans, that would remind me of why I love this.\n\nOn the challenges of choreography\nIt’s really hard for me to memorize choreography.  Dancers keep count, but I can’t memorize choreography that way. So I have to assign movement to an exact lyric. Everything in my brain has to be assigned to a lyric. Because I have to learn choreography in a way that reverts back to songwriting. My vibe is I have to rehearse so, so many times for so long that I can do the choreography without thinking about it. Because when I’m thinking about choreography, my face says it. You can see it in my eyes. There’s a fear and, like, a deadness to my eyes if I’m trying to remember choreography.\n\nOn being less caught up in chart battles\nI’m just a little more chill about stuff like that now. Obviously, you want to do well, and you want to do things that people like and you want people not to make fun of you for that. A lot of the pressure that I feel in my career is just the fact that I’m compared to everything I’ve ever accomplished in the past and also new artists. I can’t live in that pressure cooker. Charts — I truly, truly do not understand how they work anymore. My friend Ed [Sheeran] is such a chart monger. He’s obsessed with how it works and the math of it. I have no idea what goes on with the math with it now, it used to be so easy. I don’t even get how, people get a big release week, because they they sold T-shirts, or they sold concert tickets with their albums. It’s just very confusing. But I was stoked about the “ME!” music video getting that many YouTube views. I was like, well, that’s like, that’s something to write home about.\n\nOn the longevity of songs\nI think it often takes a lot of time for people to understand how they feel about music. And I know that now because there’s a song on Red called “All Too Well” that I’m really, really proud of, and it took people about three years to note that that was one of the best songs. I didn’t see that starting to pop up  when people would talk about my music until about two or three years after the album had its moment. So one thing that’s actually really comforting about music — and I know that people consume at a crazy speed now — but I think that things settle for people after a long period of time. My music kind of assigns itself to maybe a moment in somebody’s life; that’s the way that my fans usually describe it. So when you’re dealing in memory curation in a way, if they have memories that include one of my songs, they go and they live their lives and those memories become further in the past and more nostalgic to them, and the music becomes more important to them.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift’s Nashville apartment is an Etsy fever dream, a 365-days-a-year Christmas shop, pure teenage girl id. You enter through a vestibule clad in blue velvet and covered in gilt frames bursting with fake flowers. The ceiling is painted like the night sky. Above a koi pond in the living area, a narrow staircase spirals six feet up towards a giant, pillow-lagged birdcage that probably has the best view in the city. Later, Swift will tell me she needs metaphors “to understand anything that happens to me”, and the birdcage defies you not to interpret it as a pointed comment on the contradictions of stardom.\n\nSwift, wearing pale jeans and dip-dyed shirt, her sandy hair tied in a blue scrunchie, leads the way up the staircase to show me the view. The decor hasn’t changed since she bought this place in 2009, when she was 19. “All of these high rises are new since then,” she says, gesturing at the squat glass structures and cranes. Meanwhile her oven is still covered in stickers, more teenage diary than adult appliance.\n\nNow 29, she has spent much of the past three years living quietly in London with her boyfriend, actor Joe Alwyn, making the penthouse a kind of time capsule, a monument to youthful naivety given an unlimited budget – the years when she sang about Romeo and Juliet and wore ballgowns to awards shows; before she moved to New York and honed her slick, self-mythologising pop.\n\nIt is mid-August. This is Swift’s first UK interview in more than three years, and she seems nervous: neither presidential nor goofy (her usual defaults), but quick with a tongue-out “ugh” of regret or frustration as she picks at her glittery purple nails. We climb down from the birdcage to sit by the pond, and when the conversation turns to 2016, the year the wheels came off for her, Swift stiffens as if driving over a mile of speed bumps. After a series of bruising public spats (with Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj) in 2015, there was a high-profile standoff with Kanye West. The news that she was in a relationship with actor Tom Hiddleston, which leaked soon after, was widely dismissed as a diversionary tactic. Meanwhile, Swift went to court to prosecute a sexual assault claim, and faced a furious backlash when she failed to endorse a candidate in the 2016 presidential election, allowing the alt-right to adopt her as their “Aryan princess”.\n\nHer critics assumed she cared only about the bottom line. The reality, Swift says, is that she was totally broken. “Every domino fell,” she says bitterly. “It became really terrifying for anyone to even know where I was. And I felt completely incapable of doing or saying anything publicly, at all. Even about my music. I always said I wouldn’t talk about what was happening personally, because that was a personal time.” She won’t get into specifics. “I just need some things that are mine,” she despairs. “Just some things.”\n\nA year later, in 2017, Swift released her album Reputation, half high-camp heel turn, drawing on hip-hop and vaudeville (the brilliantly hammy Look What You Made Me Do), half stunned appreciation that her nascent relationship with Alwyn had weathered the storm (the soft, sensual pop of songs Delicate and Dress).\n\nHer new album, Lover, her seventh, was released yesterday. It’s much lighter than Reputation: Swift likens writing it to feeling like “I could take a full deep breath again”. Much of it is about Alwyn: the Galway Girl-ish track London Boy lists their favourite city haunts and her newfound appreciation of watching rugby in the pub with his uni mates; on the ruminative Afterglow, she asks him to forgive her anxious tendency to assume the worst.\n\nWhile she has always written about relationships, they were either teenage fantasy or a postmortem on a high-profile breakup, with exes such as Jake Gyllenhaal and Harry Styles. But she and Alwyn have seldom been pictured together, and their relationship is the only other thing she won’t talk about. “I’ve learned that if I do, people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion,” she says, laughing after I attempt a stealthy angle. “If you and I were having a glass of wine right now, we’d be talking about it – but it’s just that it goes out into the world. That’s where the boundary is, and that’s where my life has become manageable. I really want to keep it feeling manageable.”\n\nInstead, she has swapped personal disclosure for activism. Last August, Swift broke her political silence to endorse Democratic Tennessee candidate Phil Bredesen in the November 2018 senate race. Vote.org reported an unprecedented spike in voting registration after Swift’s Instagram post, while Donald Trump responded that he liked her music “about 25% less now”.\n\nMeanwhile, her recent single You Need To Calm Down admonished homophobes and namechecked US LGBTQ rights organisation Glaad (which then saw increased donations). Swift filled her video with cameos from queer stars such as Ellen DeGeneres and Queen singer Adam Lambert, and capped it with a call to sign her petition in support of the Equality Act, which if passed would prohibit gender- and sexuality-based discrimination in the US. A video of Polish LGBTQ fans miming the track in defiance of their government’s homophobic agenda went viral. But Swift was accused of “queerbaiting” and bandwagon-jumping. You can see how she might find it hard to work out what, exactly, people want from her.\n\nIt was girlhood that made Swift a multimillionaire. When country music’s gatekeepers swore that housewives were the only women interested in the genre, she proved them wrong. Her self-titled debut marked the longest stay on the Billboard 200 by any album released in the decade. A potentially cloying image – corkscrew curls, lyrics thick on “daddy” and down-home values – were undercut by the fact she was evidently, endearingly, a bit of a freak, an unusual combination of intensity and artlessness. Also, she was really, really good at what she did, and not just for a teenager: her entirely self-written third album, 2010’s Speak Now, is unmatched in its devastatingly withering dismissals of awful men.\n\nAs a teenager, Swift was obsessed with VH1’s Behind The Music, the series devoted to the rise and fall of great musicians. She would forensically rewatch episodes, trying to pinpoint the moment a career went wrong. I ask her to imagine she’s watching the episode about herself and do the same thing: where was her misstep? “Oh my God,” she says, drawing a deep breath and letting her lips vibrate as she exhales. “I mean, that’s so depressing!” She thinks back and tries to deflect. “What I remember is that [the show] was always like, ‘Then we started fighting in the tour bus and then the drummer quit and the guitarist was like, “You’re not paying me enough.”’’’\n\nBut that’s not what she used to say. In interviews into her early 20s, Swift often observed that an artist fails when they lose their self-awareness, as if repeating the fact would work like an insurance against succumbing to the same fate. But did she make that mistake herself? She squeezes her nose and blows to clear a ringing in her ears before answering. “I definitely think that sometimes you don’t realise how you’re being perceived,” she says. “Pop music can feel like it’s The Hunger Games, and like we’re gladiators. And you can really lose focus of the fact that that’s how it feels because that’s how a lot of stan [fan] Twitter and tabloids and blogs make it seem – the overanalysing of everything makes it feel really intense.”\n\nShe describes the way she burned bridges in 2016 as a kind of obliviousness. “I didn’t realise it was like a classic overthrow of someone in power – where you didn’t realise the whispers behind your back, you didn’t realise the chain reaction of events that was going to make everything fall apart at the exact, perfect time for it to fall apart.”\n\nHere’s that chain reaction in full. With her 2014 album 1989 (the year she was born), Swift transcended country stardom, becoming as ubiquitous as Beyoncé. For the first time she vocally embraced feminism, something she had rejected in her teens; but, after a while, it seemed to amount to not much more than a lot of pictures of her hanging out with her “squad”, a bevy of supermodels, musicians and Lena Dunham. The squad very much did not include her former friend Katy Perry, whom Swift targeted in her song Bad Blood, as part of what seemed like a painfully overblown dispute about some backing dancers. Then, when Nicki Minaj tweeted that MTV’s 2015 Video Music awards had rewarded white women at the expense of women of colour, multiple-nominee Swift took it personally, responding: “Maybe one of the men took your slot.” For someone prone to talking about the haters, she quickly became her own worst enemy.\n\nHer old adversary Kanye West resurfaced in February 2016. In 2009, West had invaded Swift’s stage at the MTV VMAs to protest against her victory over Beyoncé in the female video of the year category. It remains the peak of interest in Swift on Google Trends, and the conflict between them has become such a cornerstone of celebrity journalism that it’s hard to remember it lay dormant for nearly seven years – until West released his song Famous. “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,” he rapped. “Why? I made that bitch famous.” The video depicted a Swift mannequin naked in bed with men including Trump.\n\nSwift loudly condemned both; although she had discussed the track with West, she said she had never agreed to the “bitch” lyric or the video. West’s wife, Kim Kardashian, released a heavily edited clip that showed Swift at least agreeing to the “sex” line on the phone with West, if not the “bitch” part. Swift pleaded the technicality, but it made no difference: when Kardashian went on Twitter to describe her as a snake, the comparison stuck and the singer found herself very publicly “cancelled” – the incident taken as “proof” of Swift’s insincerity. So she went away.\n\nSwift says she stopped trying to explain herself, even though she “definitely” could have. As she worked on Reputation, she was also writing “a think-piece a day that I knew I would never publish: the stuff I would say, and the different facets of the situation that nobody knew”. If she could exonerate herself, why didn’t she? She leans forward. “Here’s why,” she says conspiratorially. “Because when people are in a hate frenzy and they find something to mutually hate together, it bonds them. And anything you say is in an echo chamber of mockery.”\n\nShe compares that year to being hit by a tidal wave. “You can either stand there and let the wave crash into you, and you can try as hard as you can to fight something that’s more powerful and bigger than you,” she says. “Or you can dive under the water, hold your breath, wait for it to pass and while you’re down there, try to learn something. Why was I in that part of the ocean? There were clearly signs that said: Rip tide! Undertow! Don’t swim! There are no lifeguards!” She’s on a roll. “Why was I there? Why was I trusting people I trusted? Why was I letting people into my life the way I was letting them in? What was I doing that caused this?”\n\nAfter the incident with Minaj, her critics started pointing out a narrative of “white victimhood” in Swift’s career. Speaking slowly and carefully, she says she came to understand “a lot about how my privilege allowed me to not have to learn about white privilege. I didn’t know about it as a kid, and that is privilege itself, you know? And that’s something that I’m still trying to educate myself on every day. How can I see where people are coming from, and understand the pain that comes with the history of our world?”\n\nShe also accepts some responsibility for her overexposure, and for some of the tabloid drama. If she didn’t wish a friend happy birthday on Instagram, there would be reports about severed friendships, even if they had celebrated together. “Because we didn’t post about it, it didn’t happen – and I realised I had done that,” she says. “I created an expectation that everything in my life that happened, people would see.”\n\nBut she also says she couldn’t win. “I’m kinda used to being gaslit by now,” she drawls wearily. “And I think it happens to women so often that, as we get older and see how the world works, we’re able to see through what is gaslighting. So I’m able to look at 1989 and go – KITTIES!” She breaks off as an assistant walks in with Swift’s three beloved cats, stars of her Instagram feed, back from the vet before they fly to England this week. Benjamin, Olivia and Meredith haughtily circle our feet (they are scared of the koi) as Swift resumes her train of thought, back to the release of 1989 and the subsequent fallout. “Oh my God, they were mad at me for smiling a lot and quote-unquote acting fake. And then they were mad at me that I was upset and bitter and kicking back.” The rules kept changing.\n\nSwift’s new album comes with printed excerpts from her diaries. On 29 August 2016, she wrote in her girlish, bubble writing: “This summer is the apocalypse.” As the incident with West and Kardashian unfolded, she was preparing for her court case against radio DJ David Mueller, who was fired in 2013 after Swift reported him for putting his hand up her dress at a meet-and–greet event. He sued her for defamation; she countersued for sexual assault.\n\n“Having dealt with a few of them, narcissists basically subscribe to a belief system that they should be able to do and say whatever the hell they want, whenever the hell they want to,” Swift says now, talking at full pelt. “And if we – as anyone else in the world, but specifically women – react to that, well, we’re not allowed to. We’re not allowed to have a reaction to their actions.”\n\nIn summer 2016 she was in legal depositions, practising her testimony. “You’re supposed to be really polite to everyone,” she says. But by the time she got to court in August 2017, “something snapped, I think”. She laughs. Her testimony was sharp and uncompromising. She refused to allow Mueller’s lawyers to blame her or her security guards; when asked if she could see the incident, Swift said no, because “my ass is in the back of my body”. It was a brilliant, rude defence.\n\n“You’re supposed to behave yourself in court and say ‘rear end’,” she says with mock politesse. “The other lawyer was saying, ‘When did he touch your backside?’ And I was like, ‘ASS! Call it what it is!’” She claps between each word. But despite the acclaim for her testimony and eventual victory (she asked for one symbolic dollar), she still felt belittled. It was two months prior to the beginning of the #MeToo movement. “Even this case was literally twisted so hard that people were calling it the ‘butt-grab case’. They were saying I sued him because there’s this narrative that I want to sue everyone. That was one of the reasons why the summer was the apocalypse.”\n\nShe never wanted the assault to be made public. Have there been other instances she has dealt with privately? “Actually, no,” she says soberly. “I’m really lucky that it hadn’t happened to me before. But that was one of the reasons it was so traumatising. I just didn’t know that could happen. It was really brazen, in front of seven people.” She has since had security cameras installed at every meet-and-greet she does, deliberately pointed at her lower half. “If something happens again, we can prove it with video footage from every angle,” she says.\n\nThe allegations about Harvey Weinstein came out soon after she won her case. The film producer had asked her to write a song for the romantic comedy One Chance, which earned her second Golden Globe nomination. Weinstein also got her a supporting role in the 2014 sci-fi movie The Giver, and attended the launch party for 1989. But she says they were never alone together.\n\n“He’d call my management and be like, ‘Does she have a song for this film?’ And I’d be like, ‘Here it is,’” she says dispassionately. “And then I’d be at the Golden Globes. I absolutely never hung out. And I would get a vibe – I would never vouch for him. I believe women who come forward, I believe victims who come forward, I believe men who come forward.” Swift inhales, flustered. She says Weinstein never propositioned her. “If you listen to the stories, he picked people who were vulnerable, in his opinion. It seemed like it was a power thing. So, to me, that doesn’t say anything – that I wasn’t in that situation.”\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump was more than nine months into his presidency, and still Swift had not taken a position. But the idea that a pop star could ever have impeded his path to the White House seemed increasingly naive. In hindsight, the demand that Swift speak up looks less about politics and more about her identity (white, rich, powerful) and a moralistic need for her to redeem herself – as if nobody else had ever acted on a vindictive instinct, or blundered publicly.\n\nBut she resisted what might have been an easy return to public favour. Although Reputation contained softer love songs, it was better known for its brittle, vengeful side (see This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things). She describes that side of the album now as a “bit of a persona”, and its hip-hop-influenced production as “a complete defence mechanism”. Personally, I thought she had never been more relatable, trashing the contract of pious relatability that traps young women in the public eye.\n\nIt was the assault trial, and watching the rights of LGBTQ friends be eroded, that finally politicised her, Swift says. “The things that happen to you in your life are what develop your political opinions. I was living in this Obama eight-year paradise of, you go, you cast your vote, the person you vote for wins, everyone’s happy!” she says. “This whole thing, the last three, four years, it completely blindsided a lot of us, me included.”\n\nShe recently said she was “dismayed” when a friend pointed out that her position on gay rights wasn’t obvious (what if she had a gay son, he asked), hence this summer’s course correction with the single You Need To Calm Down (“You’re comin’ at my friends like a missile/Why are you mad?/When you could be GLAAD?”). Didn’t she feel equally dismayed that her politics weren’t clear? “I did,” she insists, “and I hate to admit this, but I felt that I wasn’t educated enough on it. Because I hadn’t actively tried to learn about politics in a way that I felt was necessary for me, making statements that go out to hundreds of millions of people.”\n\nShe explains her inner conflict. “I come from country music. The number one thing they absolutely drill into you as a country artist, and you can ask any other country artist this, is ‘Don’t be like the Dixie Chicks!’” In 2003, the Texan country trio denounced the Iraq war, saying they were “ashamed” to share a home state with George W Bush. There was a boycott, and an event where a bulldozer crushed their CDs. “I watched country music snuff that candle out. The most amazing group we had, just because they talked about politics. And they were getting death threats. They were made such an example that basically every country artist that came after that, every label tells you, ‘Just do not get involved, no matter what.’\n\n“And then, you know, if there was a time for me to get involved…” Swift pauses. “The worst part of the timing of what happened in 2016 was I felt completely voiceless. I just felt like, oh God, who would want me? Honestly.” She would otherwise have endorsed Hillary Clinton? “Of course,” she says sincerely. “I just felt completely, ugh, just useless. And maybe even like a hindrance.”\n\nI suggest that, thinking selfishly, her coming out for Clinton might have made people like her. “I wasn’t thinking like that,” she stresses. “I was just trying to protect my mental health – not read the news very much, go cast my vote, tell people to vote. I just knew what I could handle and I knew what I couldn’t. I was literally about to break. For a while.” Did she seek therapy? “That stuff I just really wanna keep personal, if that’s OK,” she says.\n\nShe resists blaming anyone else for her political silence. Her emergence as a Democrat came after she left Big Machine, the label she signed to at 15. (They are now at loggerheads after label head Scott Borchetta sold the company, and the rights to Swift’s first six albums, to Kanye West’s manager, Scooter Braun.) Had Borchetta ever advised her against speaking out? She exhales. “It was just me and my life, and also doing a lot of self-reflection about how I did feel really remorseful for not saying anything. I wanted to try and help in any way that I could, the next time I got a chance. I didn’t help, I didn’t feel capable of it – and as soon as I can, I’m going to.”\n\nSwift was once known for throwing extravagant 4 July parties at her Rhode Island mansion. The Instagram posts from these star-studded events – at which guests wore matching stars-and-stripes bikinis and onesies – probably supported a significant chunk of the celebrity news industry GDP. But in 2017, they stopped. “The horror!” wrote Cosmopolitan, citing “reasons that remain a mystery” for their disappearance. It wasn’t “squad” strife or the unavailability of matching cozzies that brought the parties to an end, but Swift’s disillusionment with her country, she says.\n\nThere is a smart song about this on the new album – the track that should have been the first single, instead of the cartoonish ME!. Miss Americana And The Heartbreak Prince is a forlorn, gothic ballad in the vein of Lana Del Rey that uses high-school imagery to dismantle American nationalism: “The whole school is rolling fake dice/You play stupid games/You win stupid prizes,” she sings with disdain. “Boys will be boys then/Where are the wise men?”\n\nAs an ambitious 11-year-old, she worked out that singing the national anthem at sports games was the quickest way to get in front of a large audience. When did she start feeling conflicted about what America stands for? She gives another emphatic ugh. “It was the fact that all the dirtiest tricks in the book were used and it worked,” she says. “The thing I can’t get over right now is gaslighting the American public into being like” – she adopts a sanctimonious tone – “‘If you hate the president, you hate America.’ We’re a democracy – at least, we’re supposed to be – where you’re allowed to disagree, dissent, debate.” She doesn’t use Trump’s name. “I really think that he thinks this is an autocracy.”\n\nAs we speak, Tennessee lawmakers are trying to impose a near-total ban on abortion. Swift has staunchly defended her “Tennessee values” in recent months. What’s her position? “I mean, obviously, I’m pro-choice, and I just can’t believe this is happening,” she says. She looks close to tears. “I can’t believe we’re here. It’s really shocking and awful. And I just wanna do everything I can for 2020. I wanna figure out exactly how I can help, what are the most effective ways to help. ’Cause this is just…” She sighs again. “This is not it.”\n\nIt is easy to forget that the point of all this is that a teenage Taylor Swift wanted to write love songs. Nemeses and negativity are now so entrenched in her public persona that it’s hard to know how she can get back to that, though she seems to want to. At the end of Daylight, the new album’s dreamy final song, there’s a spoken-word section: “I want to be defined by the things that I love,” she says as the music fades. “Not the things that I hate, not the things I’m afraid of, the things that haunt me in the middle of the night.” As well as the songs written for Alwyn, there is one for her mother, who recently experienced a cancer relapse: “You make the best of a bad deal/I just pretend it isn’t real,” Swift sings, backed by the Dixie Chicks.\n\nHow does writing about her personal life work if she’s setting clearer boundaries? “It actually made me feel more free,” she says. “I’ve always had this habit of never really going into detail about exactly what situation inspired what thing, but even more so now.” This is only half true: in the past, Swift wasn’t shy of a level of detail that invited fans to figure out specific truths about her relationships. And when I tell her that Lover feels a more emotionally guarded album, she bristles. “I know the difference between making art and living your life like a reality star,” she says. “And then even if it’s hard for other people to grasp, my definition is really clear.”\n\nEven so, Swift begins Lover by addressing an adversary, opening with a song called I Forgot That You Existed (“it isn’t love, it isn’t hate, it’s just indifference”), presumably aimed at Kanye West, a track that slightly defeats its premise by existing. But it sweeps aside old dramas to confront Swift’s real nemesis, herself. “I never grew up/It’s getting so old,” she laments on The Archer.\n\nShe has had to learn not to pre-empt disaster, nor to run from it. Her life has been defined by relationships, friendships and business relationships that started and ended very publicly (though she and Perry are friends again). At the same time, the rules around celebrity engagement have evolved beyond recognition in her 15 years of fame. Rather than trying to adapt to them, she’s now asking herself: “How do you learn to maintain? How do you learn not to have these phantom disasters in your head that you play out, and how do you stop yourself from sabotage – because the panic mechanism in your brain is telling you that something must go wrong.” For her, this is what growing up is. “You can’t just make cut-and-dry decisions in life. A lot of things are a negotiation and a grey area and a dance of how to figure it out.”\n\nAnd so this time, Swift is sticking around. In December she will turn 30, marking the point after which more than half her life will have been lived in public. She’ll start her new decade with a stronger self-preservationist streak, and a looser grip (as well as a cameo in Cats). “You can’t micromanage life, it turns out,” she says, drily.\n\nWhen Swift finally answered my question about the moment she would choose in the VH1 Behind The Music episode about herself, the one where her career turned, she said she hoped it wouldn’t focus on her “apocalypse” summer of 2016. “Maybe this is wishful thinking,” she said, “but I’d like to think it would be in a couple of years.” It’s funny to hear her hope that the worst is still to come while sitting in her fairytale living room, the cats pacing: a pragmatist at odds with her romantic monument to teenage dreams. But it sounds something like perspective.",

Swift, who’s credited as the sole songwriter, penned the love song at the piano the night before joining Antonoff and sound engineer Laura Sisk at New York’s Electric Lady Studios.\n\n“lover the song out today. did this one entirely at electric lady in NYC. only laura sisk and taylor in the room. taylor wrote every stitch of this song and came in and played it for me – just a perfect moment to hear what she had done alone the night before,” Antonoff said on Twitter Friday (Aug. 16).\n\n\nHe went on to describe the six-hour session that commenced: “when someone brings in a song that speaks so much just on a piano it’s rare to imagine production around,” he wrote, “but then we started playing with space echo reverb on a snare hit really hard with a brush.”\n\n“from there the ‘paul’ bass happened and the washy piano. melotron in bride to sound like a dream sequence wedding. but the part i’m most proud of is her voice drowned in verb. cuts right through and sits all around you at the same time. worked that night for about 6 hours and besides the mix all the tracks and takes are from then. live drum, bass, acoustic, 12 string, upright piano and melotron. all going through copycat and space echo. big mess until it’s not,” said Antonoff, who also lent a hand to Lover track “The Archer.”\n\nSwift confirmed the full track list of Lover the album on Friday, revealing that “Lover” the song is track three. A music video for the song will premiere on Aug. 22 following a 5 p.m. ET YouTube live stream ahead of the album’s release. The full album drops on Aug. 23.\n\nSee Antonoff’s updates about working with Swift below.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Shares Intimate Details of 'Lover' Songs During Secret Session\nBy Nicole Mastrogiannis\n\nAugust 23, 2019\n\nToday, August 23rd, 2019, is the day that Swifties all over the world has been waiting for. After all the Easter eggs, all the fan theories, all the countdowns, the moment has finally arrived: Taylor Alison Swift's new album Lover is officially here!\n\nLover is a gorgeous collection of 18 songs about every aspect that love has to offer. It started with \"Me!\" featuring Brendon Urie of Panic! At the Disco, followed by the amazing anthem we know as “You Need to Calm Down,” and then two more songs, \"The Archer\" and title track \"Lover,\" all leading up to full album release — T-Swift's previously teased \"next chapter.\" \n\nAs many Swifties already know, Taylor held several Lover Secret Sessions in cities including London, Nashville, and Los Angeles as she shared her new album with fans for the very first time. And in case you're wondering, here's how fan get invited to these exclusive gatherings, according to Taylor herself: \"This is something where you can’t buy a ticket, there's no real way to try and figure out how to get in other than maybe you made a video that made me laugh, so I screenshotted it and sent it to Taylor Nation. Or maybe you did some really grassroots marketing with post-it notes, I don't know. Or maybe you had been fiercely defensive of me on Twitter.\"\n\nWell, if you didn’t make it to one of these amazing listening parties, iHeartRadio let Swifties in on the fun during the iHeartRadio Lover Album Release Party and Secret Session. During the broadcast special, Taylor opened up about Lover and the intimate stories behind some of the album's songs.\n\nFans can listen to the iHeartRadio Lover Album Release Party and Secret Session on repeat all weekend long on the Taylor Swift: Lover Radio station via the iHeartRadio app. While you listen, grab some freshly baked cookies (or maybe heart-shaped marshmallow treats is more your thing?), and check out what we learned about some of her new songs from Taylor Swift's exclusive Lover Secret Session below.\n\n\"The Man\"\n\"This is a song that I have wanted to write for a very long time, but never knew exactly how to. I often think about what my career would have been like, and what my headlines about my career would have been like if I had been a man instead of a woman. Not what would I do differently or anything, but if I had had the same accomplishments, the same mistakes, the same dating history, the same statements — what would have been different? This is a song called 'The Man,' and it's just about how the world would be if I had been a dude in my approximations of it.\"\n\n\n\"Paper Rings\"\n“[This] is a song that me and Jack [Antonoff] basically wrote ... part of the template for what I wanted to do with some of the songs was imagining that I was a wedding band at a reception, playing the love songs that the bride and groom wanted to hear in, like, 1978 or something. It's called 'Paper Rings.' The whole song is just basically reminiscing on fun memories. And then in the chorus, it talks about how, basically the concept of, like, your whole life you talk with your friends about how, like, ‘Oh my God. Do you wanna get married? What do you want your ring to look like? What kind of ring do you want?’ I don't know, I just feel like if you really love someone, love someone, you'd be like, 'I don't care.' And so, it talks about that concept as the hook. And in the bridge, there's some fun, kind of, punk, like inspired by punk girl groups and the way they used to sing, shouting them in a really unapologetic way. And so, I made this one with Jack, and you can hear him counting in the chorus. That's how much we wanted to sound like a wedding band. This one's a really fun one, I really like this one.\"\n\n\"London Boy\"\n\"With this song, I just kind of wrote about, basically, what it was like to basically be like, 'Bye guys! I'm gonna go here for a long time.' And there's a voice that you'll hear in the beginning of it, and it's Idris Elba's voice talking about London. And in the bridge, there's a name-check of Stella McCartney, and this name-check where I reference her was when I like ... I went over and played her the song. So, I played it for her, and she was like 'Oh my God, let's do something.' And I was like, 'OK!' And so then that's why we have this merch collaboration. She's got really amazing designs, and having them be at accessible pricing is really cool and really wonderful, and I'm glad we could figure that out.\"\n\n\"Lover\"\n\"I'm really, really proud of this song, because it's always been very hard for me to write love songs that weren't about love, and like, pining, love and secrecy, love and fear. If I wasn't writing 'Love Story,' which wasn't even about my own life; like really, it was about movies I had seen, and Romeo and Juliet, and sort of a fragment of it was my own life. But, I haven't really been able to write a pure 'Oh my god I love you' love song, and this is the one that I'm the most proud of. So this song is like that. And basically, I wanted it to sort of exist in a timeless era, where you wouldn't be able to guess if it was being played at a wedding reception in 1980 or 1970 or now. So, there were no instruments that we used that were new instruments since things that were invented post 70s. And so, I kind of wrote the bridge as if they were vows. You know how when people write their vows and they sort of, like, customize them; I kind of wanted to do that in the bridge of this song.\"\n\n\"Daylight\"\n\"I wrote 'Daylight' about the idea that, reputation, for me, aesthetically and thematically, felt like a very, very long night of storms and volcanic eruptions, floods, hurricanes, hail, tornadoes, endless fire, an astroid hit. And so it felt like trying to figure out what's what throughout all that. I did gain sort of an insight that I didn't have before, which was like, even though all this stuff has happened and you, at times, feel really down about stuff that's happened in your life or your past or whatever, letting it go is a really, really, really, important step. Even if you never fully get there. Reminding yourself to let things go as they present themselves, even if you can't seem to let them go yet, is a helpful exercise. And realizing that you can find love in literally the worst times in your life. You can find friendship in the worst times in your life, you can find the best things in your life that you will have forever in temporary, really awful times that will pass. And so those were all the themes I was thinking about when I wrote this song, but I don't think I was necessarily thinking about them because I wrote it really fast. But, I think about them now.\n\n\nRead on to find out some more of the stories behind Taylor Swift's new songs from her Lover Secret Sessions below.\n\n\"I Forgot That You Existed\"\n“So the album's called Lover, it's about all the facets of love that I find really interesting. Love is the broadest thing you could ever write about. And love, even when it's good, has every facet of emotional complexity in it to write from. And so, coming from having released an album called reputation, reputation was an album all in response to something — a lot of things — that happened in my life. So, reputation was pretty much like a coping mechanism. Reputation was like going through all the stages of grief over the loss of one's reputation; kind of like throwing a funeral for something that maybe wasn't even good for you to have in the first place. In doing that, and in picking the first song and writing the first song on this album, I wanted to complete the cycle of grieving, almost, and the cycle of when you go through some drama or some frustrating stuff in your life where a relationship ends, or you're going through this turmoil in your life, there's all these phases you through. And then, when you're really done with it, you hit indifference. The actual definition of getting over something is a shrug. And so, I was working with this production duo, it's Louis Bell and Frank Dukes, and they had worked with my friend Camila [Cabello], and she had made some really cool stuff with them, so I was like, 'Let’s try it.' And so, I played it for them, and they started making the track, and I wrote the song and I wanted it to be just as simple as the emotion of indifference is.\"\n\n\"Cruel Summer\"\n\"This song is one that I wrote about the feeling of a summer romance, and how often times a summer romance can be layered with all these feelings of, like, pining away and sometimes even secrecy. It deals with the idea of being in a relationship where there's some element of desperation and pain in it, where you're yearning for something that you don't quite have yet, it's just right there, and you just, like, can't reach it. So, this has some of my favorite lyrics on it, and it was so fun to write this. Jack and Annie [Clark] did the track and a lot of the instrumentation, and I did the topline in whatever language that is. A topline is all the notes and the lyrics you hear. So whatever you would sing, that is what I wrote on this. It was just so fun to write this one and I really love this one. Jack and I like to do ranting bridges. Like in 'Out of the Woods' where the bridge is the biggest moment of the song — we revisited that concept.\"\n\n\"I Think He Knows\"\n\"Basically, I was playing around with the idea of quiet confidence. There's something so sick about quiet confidence; somebody who, they're not arrogant, they're not cocky, like, that's obnoxious. But, there are certain people who just walk in and they don't need to be arrogant because there's something beaming from within them that they probably aren't even in control of. And when you meet a person like this, you're like, 'Why do I want to walk over there and talk to that person?' I can't explain it, but I think it's this quality. It can be a really shy person, it's not like you gotta be loud. Some people just seem like they know who they are, they don't need to brag about it. And I think that's such an interesting quality because I can't really explain it. And so I wrote a song about that. I mention a street called 16th Avenue, and that's a street in Nashville where I used to write songs. The songwriting/publishing houses are on that street, so if you're wondering if I just picked a random number, I didn't.\"\n\n\"Soon You’ll Get Better\"\n\"This song is one that was hard to write, because it's something that I'm going through right now. My dad got cancer when was 13 and he got better, and it wasn't a very long process, but things with my mom have been very different. This song is special in a lot of ways because when I wrote this one, I recorded it with Jack, and he was working, at the time, with the Dixie Chicks, making their new album. That's the band that made me wanna do this. There's a handful of artists that made me wanna do this. The Dixie Chicks taught me that you can have a strong female voice, saying whatever she wants in music, and experimenting with having a very feminine aesthetic, but very tough resilience to them. And their musicianship, the way that they played their instruments made me wanna play an instrument. Basically, I said to Jack, 'Can you please play this song for the Dixie Chicks? It's a really special song for me and my family, and they were such a big part of my life, and I wonder if maybe they can sing background vocals on it, or maybe even play on it if they wanted to.' And he played it for them, and they got really emotional hearing it, and wanted to sing on it and play fiddle and banjo on it too. So, the background vocals that you're hearing in this song are the Dixie Chicks, who I'm obsessed with.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Talks Newfound ‘Freedom,’ ’Lover’ Tour Plans and So Much More\nBy\nSierra Marquina\nAug 27, 2019\n\nTaylor Swift can come to the phone now — and she has no time for inequality, bullies or feeling redundant. The Grammy-winning artist phoned into On Air With Ryan Seacrest on Tuesday, August 27, and dished to Ryan Seacrest she’s entered a new era of “freedom” with the release of highly-anticipated album Lover. The “ME!” singer also clarified how she’ll go about re-recording her original songs which were recently purchased from under her and also her plans for a Lover tour. And, not to mention, how she’s grown up in the process.\n\nListen back to the full interview and read through the transcription below to learn more, including how she almost named the album \"Daylight\" to how she'll be turning to her fans to help make future decisions and much, MUCH more:\n\nOn Powerful Track “The Man”:\n\n“If a man hears that song and feels uncomfortable, that means he’s probably not the greatest feminist. What's great is like when you hear that song — we do these things called 'Secret Sessions' and we have fans come and listen to the album beforehand and its guys and girls — and I see the guys out there nodding along to the song, because what we need in any fight for equality, in any group of people, is we need people from the other side to say, 'Yeah, you’re right. You’re right to want that.' So any time men are like, 'I love your song 'The Man.' I’m like, 'You know what? I want to give you a hug and a high five.'”\n\n“It’s a song I’ve been wanting to write for a very long time because I've noticed the inequality starts at a basic perception level where it's like nothing we do is perceived exactly the same, so how are we ever supposed to ask for equal pay? [Or] equal standing entrance into the boys’ club or whatever when nothing we do is viewed the same? So that's what I kind of wanted to go into with the song.”\n\nOn How She Spent the First 13 Minutes of Album Release Night:\n\n“Geographically I was in New York. I was in a hotel, in a room, that I had a few friends there. Jack Antonoff was there, who produced a lot of the songs on the record with me and wrote several things with me, and then I had my parents. I had a lot of people in the management team who have been absolutely killing themselves for six months preparing for this release so basically had like 20, 25 people in the room and … I was on Tumblr and one of my fans was like, ‘Guys! It’s on iTunes!’ And that happened like maybe 10 minutes early and I was like, 'Guys! Check your phone!' …. And so we all started freaking out and then playing the songs on our phones because these are songs that I've only been able to hear just me, like, in headphones, never being able to play out loud on the phone for the past year or so. It was amazing. It was this incredible experience and then all of a sudden what happens at midnight is the reviews start posting because these journalists have heard the album beforehand … so the reviews started hitting and all of a sudden, I’m like, 'These are the best reviews I've ever gotten my entire career.' Like, my hands were on my face. I was fully in shambles … I was like on the floor.”\n\nOn If the Positive Lover Reviews Impacted Re-Recording Her Earlier Songs:\n\n“I think it definitely did and especially the fact that this is the first album that I own. It’s my own work, you know? It's crazy when you create things for 13, 14 years and then all of it is sold out from under you and you have this new fresh beginning and the first chance to actually own your art that you’ve been making all along and the fact that everyone is like, ‘Oh, no, this is the best thing that you’ve made.‘ Like, I cannot explain to you. Like, it gets me emotional even talking about [it]. Like, I can’t explain to you how good that feels because it's the first thing that no one can take from me. No one can sell it. It's mine.”\n\nOn How She’ll Re-Record Earlier Songs and Embrace Her Newfound Freedom:\n\n“I have almost a year to plan and get all my ducks in a row and I’m really going to be listening to the fans because there are some amazing ideas that they’ve had. I’m always looking on Instagram and Tumblr and Twitter and seeing what they would want. Like, some of the things that they’ve said that are really interesting to me are like I wrote the song ‘Better Man’ for Little Big Town, and … they took that song all the way [CMA Song of the Year etc.], but that I wrote during the Red — it was originally going to be on the Red album — so the fans are like, 'Maybe she'll put 'Better Man,' her version, on the Red album?' And I was like, 'That's an amazing idea!' So I’m going to be listening to what they are saying. I think they want me to kind of stick to the original production a bit like make them pretty close. I don’t think they’d want to hear like 'Tear Drops on My Guitar' as a pop version. … The best part is, contractually, I can make them nearly identical to what they were originally which is great.\"\n\n“I’m actually really excited, like this whole phase of my life is very much about freedom and the Lover album to me completely represents freedom. … You know creative freedom; artistic freedom; being able to actually freely own the work that I make and put everything I have into and so going back now I can do that with all the rest of my albums that I’ve made; that I’ve made every decision on; that I came up with every idea for and they will all be mine eventually which is the most amazing thing. It's really important to me as an artist to be able to have that moving forward.”\n\n\nOn If It's Harder to Name Albums Versus Songs Titles:\n\n\"They're both pretty easy for me, but … it's always different. Like, with Reputation, I came up with the album name before I even wrote song number one for that album, but with this one, I was halfway into writing the songs before I wrote the song ‘Lover.’ That’s the song I wrote alone and it was one of those songs that just freely — I just somehow wrote this song really quickly in the middle of the night at my piano — and all of a sudden I knew that was the title of the album. … I almost called the album Daylight, which is the name of another song on the record, but I felt like that was a little too on the nose because Reputation was such a dark, like evening-nighttime-city album, and I thought that calling the next album Daylight would be too obvious and it's such a love album. It's an album about all different forms of love. Even when love hurts, this album is about the full spectrum that love makes us feel, so I was like, this album is definitely going to be called Lover.”\n\nOn What’s Next and If There Will Be a Lover Tour:\n\n“I’m not quite sure what we’re doing with touring because with this album, I was so full-on planning this album release and directing the videos and putting all these different clues in these videos and trying to make this album release experience the most fun one for my fans, that I didn’t wanna plan what we’re gonna do in terms of live and I don’t want to do the same thing every time because I don’t want my life to feel like I’m on a treadmill. There’s a lot that goes into touring that nobody knows like you have to reserve stadiums like a year and a half in advance and that to me is like a lot. Like, with Reputation, I knew that nobody would really fully understand this album until they saw it live because I knew what I had planed for it live was going to make people understand what I had made on the record. But this album is different because people are seeming to get this album on a first listen basis which is so wonderful. I can’t even tell you how much easier that is.”\n\n“I’m waiting to figure out what I’m going to do with touring … I don’t want to feel like I have to do the same ting every single time. I definitely want to play this album live for a lot of people. I definitely want to give fans an opportunity and give me the opportunity to vibe with them on these songs in a live setting and see them sing the words back, but I don’t really know exactly what way that’s going to happen.”\n\nOn Her Growth and Need to Take a Breather:\n\n“For example, with this time, I’ve learned to have more healthy ways of communicating how I’m feeling when I’m feeling like really, really kind of overwhelmed with like obligations and planning and blah blah blah. like maybe six months ago my management team came to me and we’re like, ‘Hey, we’ve got to book the stadiums for the next tour.’ And I was like, ‘Guys, I just got off tour — I literally just got off tour. I literally just took my tights off and my thigh-high boots off from the last tour. I literally cannot do this right now. You need to give me space even if that means we have to do things a little bit differently.’ I really can’t feel like my life is just album tour, album tour, album tour, album tour.”\n\n“I think part of me growing up has been realizing my fans have been so generous to me and they’ve given me the opportunity to be able to change things up every once in awhile if its feeling like it’s too much of a pressure situation because I never want to ‘phone in’ a show. I never wanna be like this wasn’t what I wanted. … I want to give them 113% every show so I need for it to be in a way that feels right.”\n\n“Stadiums are fun. Stadiums are amazing — I love stadiums; I just don’t know if we’re going to do the same thing as we did last time…. This album is so personal, so detailed, like, Reputation was very external, very loud … this is an album that is very personal, vulnerable, emotional so my goal for whatever live setting that we decide to do things in, is gonna be to try to make wherever we are … make it feel smaller like a living room. … That’s my goal. That’s my objective, [but] I truly don’t know what we’re doing … I haven’t had the meetings yet.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "THIS PAST JUNE, R&B singer Cautious Clay was on tour in Bergen, Norway when he received a frantic 2 a.m. phone call from his lawyer. “They were like, ‘You have to approve this sample….We need an answer in 24 hours.”\n\nThe request was coming from an unlikely source: Taylor Swift. The popstar in the later stages of putting together her forthcoming album, Lover, and she was interested in incorporating the beat of Cautious Clay’s 2018 song “Cold War.\n\nTwo months later, when Swift released her seventh album album in August, Clay was one of very few outside writers to be credited on the album. Her song “London Boy” used an interpolation of the rhythm on “Cold War,” making Clay just the second-ever artist to be interpolated on a Swift recording (Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy” was credited on 2017’s “Look What You Made Me Do”). \n\n“Honestly, it’s a huge honor,” says the 26 year-old singer-songwriter. “I don’t even know, she never even shouted me out, I don’t know anything about her, really, so, to me, that she would feel it was appropriate to include that interpolation is just pretty surreal.”\n\nAlthough he has no idea, in actuality, how Swift, Sounwave, and Jack Antonoff (the song’s three co-producers) came across his music, Cautious Clay does have one possible theory. Earlier this year, Clay was leaving a bar in L.A. with his friend and collaborator John Mayer, when the two of them ran into Jack Antonoff. \n\n“I knew who he was, but I didn’t know if he knew who I was,” says Clay, whose real name is Josh Karpeh. “I didn’t think anything of it.” Karpeh introduced himself briefly to Antonoff as “Josh” and then stood quietly as Mayer and Antonoff briefly chatted. “It’s the only thing I can put two and two together on,” says Karpeh, who co-wrote Mayer’s latest single “Carry Me Away.”\n\nTwo years before it found its way onto Swift’s Anglophile loveletter, “Cold War” was just a song Karpeh was tinkering around with in his Brooklyn apartment. He wrote it in June 2017 right after returning from the annual Mermaid Parade in Coney Island. “I was writing it from that perspective, I think I was just in a weird mood,” he says. Karpeh wrote, mixed and produced the entire song by himself, in his bedroom. \n\nAlthough Cautious Clay still has no idea how his song ended up on the best selling album of the year, he concedes that the entire experience has taught him something important. \n\n“I feel like I’ve learned a whole lot about just, yeah, how this kind of stuff happens, it’s just so random,” he says. “It feels great.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "OH, TAYLOR! Taylor Swift On Side-Stepping Into Acting, Owning What You Make & Loving The “Weirdness” Of Cats\nOn a grey London afternoon in late September, Taylor Swift slips quietly through the doors of a north London recording studio. It is an auspicious moment: the queen of confessional pop has come to meet Andrew Lloyd Webber, the king of musical theatre. Together, Swift, who turns 30 this month, and Lloyd Webber,\n71, have written “Beautiful Ghosts”, a new song for the soon-to-be-released film adaptation of Cats – Webber’s 1981 extravaganza, which ran in the West End and on Broadway for a combined total of almost 40 years. In it, Swift plays Bombalurina, and like her co-stars – Idris Elba, Judi Dench, Francesca Hayward, Ian McKellen, Jennifer Hudson, Rebel Wilson – appears in full, furry CGI glory. Track finished, these two titans of the music industry sit down to talk… \n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber: Well, the first thing we have to clear up is that we both love cats. \nTaylor Swift: [Laughs] We do! One of the first things you said to me when we met was that you’re president of the Turkish Van Cat Club. \nALW: Professionally, there is nowhere I can go to top this, as you can completely understand.\nTS: I have three cats. How many do you have now? \nALW: I have three, too – they are all Turkish Vans. And you’ve got a Scottish Fold I believe.\nTS: I have two Scottish Folds, we think the third is a Ragdoll mix.\nALW: You’re probably never going to talk to me again, but you know I’ve got a puppy? He’s called Mojito. \nTS: I heard about this! How does he get along in the hierarchy? \nALW: Well, he believes he’s a little bear actually. He’s a Havanese dog, which I got because Glenn Close has one. \nTS: I’ve met that dog, he’s really good. \nALW: You come from Pennsylvania. \nTS: I do. People seem to think I was raised in the south, but I’m from the north – grew up on a Christmas tree farm, then moved to Nashville when I was 14. \nALW: And you wanted to move to Nashville for the songwriting or the singing? Or both? \nTS: Both – I was just obsessed with Shania Twain, Faith Hill, Dixie Chicks, and the thing they had in common was that they had gotten discovered in Nashville. So I had it in my head that this is a magical place where discoveries are made and people are able to do music as a living. \nALW: Was it the storytelling side of country songs that you liked? Absolutely. It reminded me of the ’90s, when you had these amazing female singer-songwriters like Alanis Morissette and Sarah McLachlan; incredible female writers like Melissa Etheridge, Shawn Colvin; and these types of Lilith Fair women. Then you started to hit the 2000s and the only place I could find real confessional storytelling was country music.\nALW: Did you know anybody when you got to Nashville?\nTS: No, we didn’t really. I’d been going there on vacation with my family, and my mom, my little brother and I would stay in a hotel and try to meet people. Eventually, after several trips, I got a development deal – it’s a non-committal record deal, like, “We’ll watch you develop for a year and then we’ll decide if we sign you.” That was grounds enough to move the family.\nALW: Presumably you were in school in Nashville as well?\nTS: Yes, I was going to high school during the day and doing my songwriting sessions at night. It was a double life. I’d be writing notes in class, and my teachers never knew if they were notes for my class or if I’d gotten an idea for a song.\nALW: How many songs would you write in a day?\nTS: Usually, never more than one. I had these sessions every day, and if I didn’t come in with a good idea, I’d get stared at. You’re not inspired every day, as you know, but you have to show up and treat it like a job. That’s where I learned the\ncraft of songwriting.\nALW: I’ve never worked like that, because I’m so story driven. What interests me, though, is how Nashville works. How did you get your foot on the performing ladder?\nTS: It was really writing first. At the same time, I was singing the national anthem every time I could – at festivals and fairs and bars, anywhere I could get up on stage. I was trying to hone both sides of what I was doing, but I’m very well aware that I would not have a career if I hadn’t been a writer. I wouldn’t have just been a singer, it wouldn’t have worked.\nALW: I guess that, today, very few people have a major career unless they write.\nTS: Yeah, I agree. I think it’s really important – also from the side of ownership over what you do and make. Even if you aren’t a natural writer, you should try to\ninvolve yourself in the messages you’re sending.\nALW: How does a young country artist get their first break?\nTS: I worked as hard as I could, reached out to as many people as I could to make sure I got meetings with publishing companies and labels. They didn’t come about very easily, but once I got in the room I’d just get out my guitar and play for them.\nALW: Do you have to sing in a certain club to get to the next stage?\nTS: Everyone does it a different way, but the Bluebird Cafe is a place where everyone was discovered – from Garth Brooks to Faith Hill to, arguably, me. \nI remember being at your house after we’d written a song, and you telling me you’d bought it when you were 24 or something, that’s when I realised just how young you were when you had a vision to be doing this at such a high level. \nALW: I was writing for the theatre when I was eight-years-old. I had a little toy theatre and did dreadful musicals on terrible subjects. Then, when I was about 13, I met a boy who wanted to write lyrics, and we did a couple of musicals at school.\nTS: So from the beginning you would pair up with a lyricist?\nALW: One of the things I worked out very early was Lloyd Webber and lyrics are not a good idea.\nTS: Wow. It is a good alliteration, though.\nALW: You were 19, weren’t you, when you had your first big hit?\nTS: I was about 18 when “Love Story”, a song I’d written alone, was a worldwide hit. I was lucky enough to work my way up in country music, for new artists nowadays, it feels like the trajectory of their career is like being shot out of a canon into a stratosphere they could in no way be prepared for. I got to sort of acclimate to every step of the path I was on, and by the time I had a massive hit I’d been working since I was 14. Moving from country music to pop was a crazy adjustment for me.\nALW: And now we’ve written “Beautiful Ghosts” together for Cats.\nTS: I remember the moment. I went over to your apartment to rehearse “Macavity” and you sat down at the piano and started to play this haunting, beautiful melody, and I think I just started singing to it right away.\nALW: You wrote the lyrics more or less then and there – it was fantastic.\nTS: It’s a different perspective on the song “Memory”, too, and the character of Grizabella [played by Jennifer Hudson], who used to have majestic, glamorous times and doesn’t anymore. On the other side of it, you have this little white cat [Victoria, played by Francesca Hayward] who’s been abandoned – she’s afraid she’ll never have a chance to have beautiful memories. So that’s where she’s singing “Beautiful Ghosts” from, to counter Grizabella’s idea of tragedy.\nALW: I’d like to come back to something I thought when I heard your album, Lover – which is really absolutely brilliant. Am I right in thinking you approached its recording just as though you were giving live performances?\nTS: I did. I was really singing a lot at that point – I’d just come from a stadium tour, and then did Cats, which was all based on live performances – so a lot of that album is nearly whole takes. When you perform live, you’re narrating and you’re getting into the story and you’re making faces that are ugly and you’re putting a different meaning on a song every time you perform it.\nALW: That’s the point isn’t it.\nTS: Yeah.\nALW: Does that ever make you feel you want to be an actress?\nTS: I have no idea. When I was younger, I used to get questions like, “Where do you see yourself in 10 years?” I’d try to answer. As I get older, I’m learning that wisdom is learning how dumb you are compared to how much you are going to know. I really had an amazing time with Cats. I think I loved the weirdness of it. I loved how I felt I’d never get another opportunity to be like this in my life.\nALW: It’s weird, what I’ve seen of the movie.\nTS: It’s decidedly weird [they laugh]. \nALW: I think Tom [Hooper, the film’s director] has really tried to make something original. And I agree, I think as you get older you do become less sure of yourself and start to question what you can do. Would you consider doing a musical?\nTS: A musical? Absolutely, absolutely.\nALW: Or writing your own?\nTS: That is way up there on my list of dreams.\nALW: You should.\nTS: Was it really wonderful for you when you got the news that Judi Dench had accepted the role of Old Deuteronomy?\nALW: Judi was in the original version in 1981 but she snapped her Achilles tendon and had to withdraw. Then I had this idea, which I ran past Tom, that we could make Old Deuteronomy a woman. Seeing her perform this time was quite an emotional thing for me, because it was a very, very sad day when she had to leave the original show.\nTS: She’s lovely. I remember being on set, and there is one scene that Idris [Elba, who plays Macavity] and I do with Judi, and someone walked up to me with this kind of gummy candy and I was like, “Oh, I’ve never had this before, this must be British candy, this is amazing.” I was raving about this candy so much, and Judi must have overheard me, because the next day I got to my dressing room and there was a signed photo from Judi and, like, six bags of it [they laugh].\nAndrew, we both started young. What do we have in common from our experiences? What do you think was hard about it? And what was great?\nALW: I suppose what was hard for me was that I was a fish out of the mainstream water. In the 1960s, to love musicals was as uncool as you could possibly be, and kids in my class at school would laugh at me.\nTS: I was the same. I loved country music and, where I was in school, the kids were just completely perplexed by that. It’s gotten more mainstream, but when I was a 13-year-old in Pennsylvania, I got similar reactions. Do you feel like you’re glad you were really young when you started?\nALW: Yeah, are you?\nTS: I’m really glad, even though there are challenges to it – like you’re not allowed to make the same mistakes as everyone else because your mistakes are a commodity.\nALW: And your mistakes are made in public. But we share something in common, in which we are extremely lucky. We both knew at an early age what we wanted to do, and most people in life don’t have a clue.\nTS: That’s very true. I think, also, a lot of the time when people see a career that they want it can be results-based. Rather than wanting to write musicals, they want to be a person who has written musicals. But when I see you work, I see you consistently creating and being curious about the next idea. You relish in the process even more than the rewards, which is the advice I would give anyone who wanted to do anything remotely close to this job. It cannot be about the results.\nALW: It’s the process isn’t it?\nTS: It has to be. It’s supposed to be fun!\n\nMEET & GREET: Introducing the faces behind this month’s issue\n\nWhen it came to interviewing Taylor Swift about her musical-movie debut\nin Cats, there was only one man for the job: Andrew Lloyd Webber, composer of the original West End and Broadway mega hit. The two colossi of songwriting had plenty to discuss at a recording studio in north London – art, ambition and authenticity, plus what we can expect from the soon-to-be-released film.\n\nVogue: What was it like to work with Taylor?\nAndrew Lloyd Webber: She’s supremely professional and very charming with it. In my view, she could go far.\nVogue: What was your first impression of her?\nALW: She’s a lot taller than me, and a lot more attractive.\nVogue: What’s your favourite Swift hit?\nALW: “Blank Space” from the album 1989. It’s a great pop song with great lyrics.",

      "Transcript/Content": "In the early autumn of each year, I host a lunch at Vogue House to meet the finalists of our Talent Contest. Since its launch in 1951, this annual initiative has sought to discover the most promising new writing talent and, as of 2018, photographers, too. Nine entrants made the 2019 final – five writers and four image-makers – all of whom were aged 25 or under and passionately engaged with making sense of the world around them.\n\nMeeting the finalists is an experience that I always enjoy, and this time was no exception. How refreshing it was to spend a couple of hours talking with those just starting out in their chosen fields. As is often the way with creatives, and certainly young ones, I was struck by how – despite being unafraid to tackle personal or political subjects through the prism of fashion – this gifted generation seems to be living somewhere between positivity and panic.\n\nSome days, it can feel like we all live there. As the din of national and international politics increases, the world can feel more serious by the minute – divided, uncertain, draining. As my thoughts turned to Vogue’s first edition of a new decade, this uncertain state was much on my mind. Ultimately, I knew that I wanted the January issue of 2020 to be woven through with a concept all too easy to forget amid the noise: hope.\n\nThat said, I’d suggest that our aspirations are a little more nuanced than they were a hundred years ago.  If the 1920s were a hardscrabble time when luxury was a straightforward concept to covet, in the 2020s we find ourselves in a different place, mindful of the world we all inhabit. In Waste Not, photographed by Craig McDean, contributing fashion director Kate Phelan offers a new-meets-old way of dressing for the future. Mixing archive and vintage from as far back as 35 years ago with exquisite new pieces commissioned from deadstock, as well as elements from the current season, it is a thoughtful template for what a more sustainable notion of luxury can look like.\n\nAs, indeed, is this month’s cover. To herald a new decade, Taylor Swift fronts Vogue wearing archive Chanel – and looks effortlessly, endlessly modern in the process. Taylor, as anyone lucky enough to spend time with her will know, is one of the most positive, forward-thinking people you could ever wish to meet, and a dream cover star for this moment in time. Welcome to the ’20s!",

      "Transcript/Content": "I come with opinions about how we can better our industry': Taylor Swift - The Music Week interview\nby Mark Sutherland\nDecember 13th 2019 at 12:20PM\n\nAround this time of year, the Taylor Swift anniversaries come at you thick and fast.\n\nNine years since her third album, Speak Now, every note of which was written entirely by Swift, hit the shelves. Five years since she released her mould-breaking pop album, 1989, and went from the world’s biggest country star to the world’s biggest pop star overnight. Two years since her Reputation record saw her become the only musician to post four successive million-plus debut sales weeks in the United States. And so on.\n\nBut today, Swift’s mind is drawn further back, to the 13th anniversary of her debut, self-titled record, and the days when her album releases weren’t automatically accompanied by mountains of hype and enough think-pieces to sink a battleship. Her journal entries from the time – helpfully reprinted as part of the deluxe editions of her new album, Lover – reveal her as an excited, optimistic teenager, but also one with a grasp of marketing strategies and label politics way beyond her years, even if she was reluctant to actually take credit for her ideas.\n\n“It always was and it always will be an interesting dance being a young woman in the music industry,” she smiles ruefully. “We don’t have a lot of female executives, we’re working on getting more female engineers and producers but, while we are such a drastic gender minority, it’s interesting to try and figure out how to be.”\n\nAnd, of course, when Swift started out she was, as she points out, “an actual kid”.\n\n“I was planning the release of my first album when I was 15 years old,” she reminisces. “And I was a fully gangly 15, I reminded everyone of their niece! I was in this industry in Nashville and country music, where I was making album marketing calls, but I never wanted to stand up and say, ‘Yeah, that promotions plan you just complimented my label on, I thought of that! Me and my Mom thought of that!’\n\n“When you’re a new artist you wonder how much space you can take up and, as a woman, you wonder how much space you can take up pretty much your whole period of growing up,” she continues. “For me, growing up and knowing that I was an adult was realising that I was allowed to take up space from a marketing perspective, from a business perspective, from an opinionated perspective. And that feels a lot better than constantly trying to wonder if I’m allowed to be here.”\n\nIn the intervening years, Taylor Swift has released six further, brilliant albums, growing from country starlet to all-conquering pop behemoth along the way. She takes up “more space”, as she would put it, than any other musician on the planet: a sales and now – having belatedly embraced the format with Lover – streaming phenomenon; a powerhouse stadium performer; an award-garlanded songwriter for herself and others; and a social media giant with a combined 278 million followers across Instagram, Twitter and Facebook (which would make the Taylor Nation the fourth most populous one on earth, after China, India and the US).\n\nBut her influence on music and the music industry doesn’t end there. Because, over the years, Swift has also become a leading advocate for artists’ and songwriters’ rights, in a digital landscape that doesn’t always have such matters as a priority.\n\nIn 2015, she stood up to Apple Music over its plans to not pay artist royalties during subscribers’ three-month free trials (Apple backed down immediately). She pulled her entire catalogue from Spotify in 2014 in protest that its free tier was devaluing music, sending Daniel Ek scrambling to justify his business model. When she returned in 2017, it was a crucial fillip for the streaming service’s IPO plans.\n\nMore recently, her ground-breaking new record deal with Republic Records contained clauses not only guaranteeing her ownership of her future masters, but also ensuring Universal Music will share the spoils of its Spotify shares with its artists, without any payments counting against unrecouped balances. And when her long-time former label boss Scott Borchetta sold Big Machine to Scooter Braun’s Ithaca Holdings, taking Swift’s first six albums with him, the star publicly called out what she saw as her “worst-case scenario” and stressed: “You deserve to own the art you make”. She may yet re-record her old songs in protest.\n\nIn short, Swift has, for a long time now, been unafraid to use her voice on industry matters, whether they pertain to her own stellar career or the thousands of other artists out there struggling to make a living.\n\nAll of which makes Swift not just the greatest star of our age, but perhaps the most important to the future development of the industry as a more artist-centric, songwriter-friendly business. Hers is still the life of the pop phenomenon – she spent today in Los Angeles doing promotion and photoshoots (or, in her words, “having people put make-up on me”) as Lover continues to build on huge critical acclaim and even huger initial sales. But now, she’s kicking back with her cats – one of whom seems determined to disrupt Music Week’s interview by “stampeding” through at every opportunity – and ready to talk business.\n\nAnd for Swift, business is good. The impact of her joining streaming, and the decline of traditional album sales, may have prevented her from posting a fifth successive one million-plus sales debut, but Lover still sold more US copies (867,000) in its first week than any record since her own Reputation. It’s sold 117,513 copies to date in the UK, according to the Official Charts Company.\n\nEven better, while Reputation – a record forged in the white heat of a social media snakestorm over her on-going feud with Kanye West – was plenty of show and rather less grow, Lover continues to reveal hidden depths. Reputation struck a sometimes curious contrast between the unrepentant warrior Swift she was showing to the outside world and the love story with British actor Joe Alwyn that was quietly developing behind closed doors, but Lover is the sort of versatile, cohesive album that the streaming age was supposed to kill off.\n\nIt contains more than its fair share of pop bangers (You Need To Calm Down, Me!), but also some gorgeously-crafted acoustic tracks (Lover, Cornelia Street), some pithy political commentary (The Man, Miss America & The Heartbreak Prince) and the sort of musical diversions (Paper Rings’ irresistible rockabilly stomp, the childlike oddity of It’s Nice To Have A Friend) that no other pop superstar would have the sheer musical chops to attempt, let alone pull off.\n\n“Taylor’s creative instincts as an artist and songwriter are brilliant,” says Monte Lipman, founder and CEO of Swift’s US label, Republic. “Our partnership represents a strategic alliance built on mutual respect, trust, and complete transparency. Her vision is extraordinary as she sets the tone for every campaign and initiative.”\n\nNo wonder David Joseph, chairman/CEO of her long-time UK label Virgin EMI’s parent company Universal Music UK, is thrilled with how things are going.\n\n“Love Story was a fitting first single release for Taylor here – she’s loved the UK from day one and has engaged so much with her fans and teams,” says Joseph. “She really respects and values what’s going on here creatively. To see her go from playing the Students’ Union at King’s College to Wembley Stadium has been extraordinary. Taylor is an artist constantly striving for perfection, and with Lover – from my personal point of view, her most accomplished work to date – her songwriting has gone to a new level. I adore working with her and whilst it’s been more than 10 years this still feels like the start.”\n\nAnd today, Swift is keen to concentrate on the present and future. She has a starring role in Cats coming up (and a new song on the soundtrack, Beautiful Ghosts, co-written with Andrew Lloyd Webber) and, after a spectacularly intimate Paris launch show in September, festival dates and her own LoverFest to plan (UK shows will be revealed soon). Time, then, to tell the cats to calm down and sit down with Music Week to talk streaming, contracts and why she’s “obsessed” with the music industry…\n\nUnlike with Reputation, most of the discussion around Lover seems to have been focused on the music…\n\n“Absolutely! One of the ideas I had about this record, and something I’ve implemented into my life in the last couple of years is that I don’t like distractions. And, for a while, it felt like my life had to come with distractions from the music, whether it was tabloid fascination with my personal life or my friendships or what I was wearing. I realised in the last couple of years that, if I don’t give a window into distraction, people can’t try to look in and see something other than the music. I love that, if you really pour yourself into the idea that an album is still important and try really hard to make something that is worth people’s attention span, time and energy, that can still come across. Because we are living in an industry right now where everyone’s rushing towards taking us into a singles industry and, in some cases, it has become that. But there are still some cases where clearly the album is important to people.”\n\nDoes it matter that some new artists won’t get to make albums the way you always have?\n\n“It’s interesting. Five years ago I wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal and said, maybe in the next five years, we would see artists releasing music the way that they want to. I thought that each artist would start to curate what is important to them, not just from an artistic standpoint but from a marketing standpoint. It’s really interesting to see different release plans, if you look at what Drake did and then what Beyoncé does, incredible artists who have really curated what it is to drop music in their own way. We all do it differently, which is cool. As long as people dropping just singles want to be doing that, then I’m fine with it, but if it feels like a big general wave that’s being pressured by people in power, their teams or their labels, that’s not cool. But I do really hope that in the future artists have more of a say over strategy. We’re not just supposed to make art and then hand it to a team that masterminds it.”\n\nWere you worried about putting an album on streaming on release day for the first time?\n\n“Well, there are ways that streaming services could really promote the [whole] album in a more incentivised way. We could have album charts on streaming. The industry follows where they can get prizes. So you have a singles chart on streaming services which is great but, if you split things up into genre charts for example, that would really incentivise people. It’s important that we keep trying to strive to make the experience better for users but also make it more interesting for artists to keep wanting to achieve. But I really did love the experience of putting the album on streaming. I loved the immediacy, I loved that people who maybe weren’t a huge diehard fan were curious and saying, ‘I wonder what this is like’ and listening to it and deciding that they liked it.”\n\nYou’d resisted streaming for a long time. Have you changed your mind about the format now?\n\n“I always knew that I would enjoy the aspects of streaming that make [your music] so immediately available to so many people. That’s the part of it that I unequivocally always felt really sad I was missing out on. There wasn’t ever a day when I woke up and I was like, ‘Oh, I’m really glad that multitudes of people don’t have access to my music!’ So I always knew that streaming was an incredible mechanism and model for the future but I still don’t think we have the royalties and compensation system worked out. That’s between the labels and their artists and I realised that me, to use a gross word, ‘leveraging’ what I can bring to cut a better deal for the artists at my record label was really important for me.”\n\nHow big a factor were things like that in you signing to Republic/Universal?\n\n“That’s important to me because that means they’re adopting some of my ideas. If they take me on as an artist that means they really thought it through. Because with me, come opinions about how we can better our industry. I’m one of the only people in the artist realm who can be loud about it. People who are on their fifth, sixth or seventh album, we’re the only ones who can speak out, because new artists and producers and writers need to work. They need to be endearing and likeable and available to their labels and streaming services at all times. It’s up to the artists who have been around for a second to say, ‘Hey guys, the producers and the writers and the artists are the ones who are making music what it is’. And we’re in a great place in music right now thanks to them. They should be going to their mailbox and feeling like they’ve got a pension plan, rather than feeling like, ‘Oh yay, I can pay half my rent this month after this No.1 song’.”\n\nDid you have more creative freedom making Lover than on your previous albums?\n\n“In my previous situation, there were creative constraints, issues that we had over the years. I’ve always given 100% to projects, I always over-delivered, thinking that that generosity would be returned to me. But I ended up finding that generosity in a new situation with a new label that understands that I deserve to own what I make. That meant so much to me because it was given over to me so freely. When someone just looks at you and says ‘Yes, you deserve what you want’, after a decade or more of being told, ‘I’m not sure you deserve what you want’ – there’s a freedom that comes with that. It’s like when people find ‘the one’ they’re like, ‘It was easy, I just knew and I felt free’. All of a sudden you’re being told you’re worth exactly, no, more than what you thought you were worth. And that made me feel I could make an album that was exactly what I wanted to make. There’s an eclectic side to Lover, a confessional side, it varies from acoustic to really poppy pop, but that’s what I like to do. And, while you would never make something artistic based on something so unromantic as a contract, it was more than that. It was a group of people saying, ‘We believe in what you’re making, go make what you want to make and you deserve to own it too’.”\n\nYou’re obviously not happy about what’s happened at Big Machine since you left. But will the attention mean artists don’t find themselves in this situation in the future?\n\n“I hope so. That’s the only reason that I speak out about things. The fans don’t understand these things, the public isn’t being made aware. This generation has so much information available to them so I thought it was important that the fans knew what I was going through, because I knew it was going to affect every aspect of my life and I wanted them to be the first to know. And in and amongst that group, I know there are people that want to make music some day. It involves every new artist that is reading that and going, ‘Wait, that’s what I’m signing?’ They don’t have to sign stuff that’s unfair to them. If you don’t ask the right questions and you sit in front of the wrong desk in front of the wrong person, they can take everything from you.”\n\nSongwriters are in dispute with Spotify in the US over its decision to appeal the Copyright Board decision to boost songwriting royalties. Do writers need more respect?\n\n“Absolutely. In terms of the power structure, the songwriters, the producers, the engineers, the people who are breathing magic into our industry, need to be listened to. They’re not being greedy. This is legitimately an industry where people are having trouble paying their bills and they’re the most talented people we have. This isn’t them sitting in their mansions going, ‘I wish this mansion was bigger and I would like a yacht please’. This is actually people who are going to work every single day. I got into writing when I was in Nashville and it was very much like what I read about the Brill Building. You would write every day, whether you were inspired or not, and in the process I met artists and writers. Somebody would walk in and someone would say, ‘Oh, he’s still getting mailbox money from that Faith Hill cut a couple of years ago, he’s set’. That’s not a thing anymore. Mailbox money is a thing of the past and we need to remember that these are the people that create the heartbeat that we’re all dancing to or crying to.”\n\nYou were clearly aware of music industry machinations from a young age…\n\n“Reading back on the journal entries, I forgot how obsessed I was with the industry as a teenager. I was so fascinated by how it works and how it was changing. Every part of it was interesting to me. I had drawn the stages for most of my tours a year before I went on them. That really was fun for me as a teenager! A lot of people who start out very young in music, either don’t have a say or don’t have the will to do the business side of it, but weirdly that was so much fun for me to try and learn. I had a lot of energy when I was 16!”\n\nAre you doing similar drawings for next year’s LoverFest?\n\n“Definitely. And that’s why it’s still fun for me to take on a challenge like, ‘Oh, let’s just plan our own festival’. Let’s create a bill of artists and try and make it as fun as possible for the fans. I’m so intrigued by what that’s going to be like.”\n\nFinally, when we last did an interview in 2015, you said in five years’ time you wanted to be “finding complexity in happiness”. How has that worked out?\n\n“That’s exactly what’s happened with this album! I think a lot of writers have the fear of stability, emotional health and happiness. Our whole careers, people make jokes about how, ‘Just wait until you meet someone nice, you’ll run out of stuff to write about’. I was talking to [Cats director] Tom Hooper about this because he said one thing his mother taught him was, ‘Don’t ever let people tell you that you can’t make art if you’re happy’. I thought that was so amazing. He’s a creator in a completely different medium but he has been subjected to that same joke over and over again that we must be miserable to create. Lover is important to me in so many ways, but it’s so imperative for me as a human being that songwriting is not tied to my own personal misery. It’s good to know that, it really is!”",

      "Transcript/Content": "TAYLOR SWIFT: ‘I’ve always found romance in life’s small moments’\nPhotographs by Miller Mobley // Interview by Melody Chiu // People Magazine, Dec 16th 2019 issue\nShattering records with her euphoric new album Lover, the superstar is happier and more fearless than ever: ‘I’m always looking for a new challenge.’\n\nIt’s hard to believe Taylor Swift is turning 30. A decade ago she became the youngest person to take home the Album of the Year Grammy. Now the superstar, who celebrates her milestone birthday on Dec. 13, is breaking records - and her silence - like never before. Ahead of releasing her seventh studio album, Lover, in August, Swift took on her former record label Big Machine and its new owner Scooter Braun over the rights to her previous recordings. With the dawn of a new decade and an upcoming tour, Swift - who is happily three years into her relationship with actor Joe Alwyn - is as excited about her future as she is protective of her past. “This is the first time I’ve been able to put out music that I feel is connecting with people yet look back on everything I’ve made and feel a quiet sense of pride,” she says. “I’m proud of the things I’ve withstood, and I’ve been able to carve out a life for myself.”\n\nYou’ve had a lot of big years, but this one feels a little different. What does 2019 mean to you?\nThis year feels more special to me than any year before it. A lot of people will tell you that when they had their breakthrough year, they weren’t able to enjoy it because they were hustling or stressed. 2009 was a breakthrough year for me in country, then 2014 was a big breakthrough year in pop. Fifteen years into doing this, being able to look around and acknowledge that it’s special, I’m really stoked this moment can happen when I’m 29. That’s one of the benefits of starting when you’re 12!\n\nLover comes not even two years after your prior album Reputation. Were you feeling creatively supercharged?\nI had this strange feeling of “I could write anything I want now.” There was so much theatricality in the darkness of Reputation. It was secretly a love story, but it was also filled with angst, rebellion and this vengeful taking back of your life. Lover ended up being the album [where I was no longer] answering to something. In the past I’ve definitely used my criticism as a jumping-off point for creativity. With Reputation I’d said everything I needed to say. I’d been tried in every possible way people could throw things at me, and I felt like now I just get to create.\n\nYou’ve been writing love songs since you were a teenager. What would 13-year-old Taylor say about Lover?\nThis is the most I’ve ever leaned into who I really am. For this album I went through my old diaries as a kid. Looking back, I’ve always found romance in life’s small moments - tiny details that are beautiful about the human experience. Lover in a lot of ways is that.\n\nYou’re known for magnifying those little moments into a hit song, but do you feel more protective of yourself now?\nIn this job people are constantly skeptical and evaluating whether you deserve to be there. There are tests every day, but I try to be susceptible to my feelings on it. I try to be resilient, but I don’t ever want to become closed off in a way that I can’t access sadness, loneliness, anxiety and despair. I personally feel like the best thing I have to offer is the music I write.\n\nYour Change.org petition in support of the Equality Act (which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity) has nearly 600,000 signatures, and your “You Need to Calm Down” music video, featuring many LGBTQ+ stars, has more than 164 million views. Is it gratifying to see these numbers after breaking your political silence?\nWhen you advocate for something, it has to be completely disconnected from what people say about you advocating for it. It should be removed from hard numbers. That being said, when numbers do come in that are promising and petitions are signed in the hundreds of thousands, it’s a good feeling. It reinforces your feeling that there is good in the world.\n\nHas speaking out, whether about politics or owning the rights to all your songs before Lover, made you feel stronger at the end of the day?\nIt makes me feel like my fans are able to know me more. What I believe in and what people know I believe in are aligned. That’s a great sense of relief. When Lover came out, it was this sense of being so thankful that after so long of being denied the rights to music that I made, I finally felt like I was in a place where I had aligned myself with generous people. The label that I’m at now, there’s not a single person in that sphere that wants to deny me of what I created. It’s nice to know I can say what I believe in and disconnect from if people don’t like that. And I can sleep really well at night.\n\nHow do you feel about your 30s?\nReally happy! There are certain parts of my brain that I don’t visit as often, like stressing out about my body, stressing out about being on trend, stressing out about people thinking I’m cool, stressing out about people thinking really anything about me. You have to toss out things that don’t serve you.\n\nWhat’s the last great day off you had?\nOh, yesterday was amazing. My friend Cazzie [David] came over, and we swam. My friends and their kids were staying with me, so I was playing with a 3- and a 5-year-old. Then I picked a paint color for my living room wall, which is really gonna warm up the whole vibe. My parents and my brother came over, and I cooked this whole dinner. Cooking, reading and seeing friends are things that make me feel like my life was never anything but normal, so I spend a lot of time doing those things. I just want to make sure I’m living my life in a way that makes me feel happy and fulfilled.\n\n\nimage\nTHE MOST INSPIRING WOMAN TO ME THIS YEAR:\nWhenever I feel stressy about things, I’ll just read some of Jameela Jamil’s quotes about body image and health.\n\nWHAT I ’M LOOKING FORWARD TO MOST IN 2020:\nI’m really excited about customizing [my upcoming tour] Lover Fest. I’ve never really performed on that kind of stage since opening up for Tim McGraw and George Strait in 2007.\n\nTHE 2019 BOOK I DEVOURED:\nDemi Moore’s autobiography. I couldn’t put it down. She was punished ruthlessly for being the highest-paid actress, and I feel like finally she’s getting the last laugh.\n\nA NEW THING I LEARNED THIS YEAR:\nI’m working my way through the Ottolenghi Simple cookbook. I recently made the chicken marbella.\n\n\nimage\nThe PEOPLE behind People\n\nDeputy west coast news editor Melody Chiu first interviewed Taylor Swift before the release of 1989: “Sitting down with her five years later, Taylor was as generous as ever, and her unshakable confidence is inspiring.”\n\nDan Wakeford, People Magazine Editor in Chief: “Although she’s been a singer for more than 15 years, 2019 was arguably the year Taylor Swift found her voice. She stood up to protect her creative rights, spoke out for what she believed in and continued to produce music that showed wisdom and storytelling beyond her years - her album Lover became 2019’s bestselling record in just one week. Truly epic.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "How Midterm Elections Inspired Taylor Swift’s New Song, ‘Only the Young’\n\nJan 21, 2020 8:30am PT\nBy Chris Willman\n\nMiss Americana was keeping another song about America in her back pocket, as it turns out. Taylor Swift recorded a song during her “Lover” album sessions, “Only the Young,” that was held back and kept under wraps for the right occasion — that occasion turning out to be “Miss Americana,” the Lana Wilson-directed documentary that premieres at the Sundance Film Festival Jan. 23 and goes wide to the public in theaters and on Netflix Jan. 31.\n\nIn an an interview for this week’s Variety cover story, Swift described the tune’s origins. Its writing followed a personally disappointing moment for the singer after the 2018 midterm elections, when she got involved by endorsing candidates in the senatorial and gubernatorial races in her home state of Tennessee, only to see them go down despite her best efforts — and those of a lot of fans she urged to sign up to vote and campaign.\n\n“I wrote it after the midterm elections, when there were so many young people who rallied for their candidate, whether it was a senator or congressman or congresswoman,” Swift tells Variety. “It was hard to see so many people feel like they had canvassed and done everything and tried so hard. I saw a lot of young people’s hopes dashed. And I found that to be particularly tragic, because young people are the people who feel the worst effects of gun violence, and student loans and trying to figure out how to start their lives and how to pay their bills, and climate change, and are we going to war — all these horrific situations that we find ourselves facing right now.”\n\nIt won’t be any secret to anyone watching the documentary just how crestfallen she was when the senatorial candidate Swift had declared stood in opposition to women’s issues and gay rights lost.\n\n“I was really upset about Tennessee going the way that it did, obviously. And so I just wanted to write a song about it. I didn’t know where it would end up. But I did think that it would be better for it to come out at a time that it could maybe hopefully stoke some fires politically and maybe engage younger people to form their own views, break away from the pack, and not feel like they need to vote exactly the same way that people in their town are voting.”\n\nSwift is seen demo-ing the song during the body of the film, before a fully produced version kicks in at the end. “With the way that the documentary ended up being politically leaning, when Lana wanted to put it in the film and use it as an end-credit song, I just went along with it. Just like everything else!” she laughs, asserting again that decisions about the film were really up to her director.\n\n\nKey lyrics from the song: “You did all that you could do / The game was rigged, the ref got tricked/ The wrong ones think they’re right / We were outnumbered — this time.” Although it isn’t specific about particular causes or political issues, the track references forces that are “too busy helping themselves… We gotta do it ourselves.”\n\nThe song was co-written and co-produced with Joel Little. With the “Lover” album, he seems to have become Swift’s go-to guy, deliberately or just by coincidence, for message songs. The other tracks they worked on all, or almost all, fit into that category — “Miss Americana,” “The Man,” “You Need to Calm Down” and (if you consider self-esteem anthems  message songs, too) “Me!” Now, “Only the Young” arrives as an unexpected addition to that portfolio.\n\nSays Little, “We did a week in New York; that week we did ‘The Man’ and ‘Me!,’ and ‘Only the Young’ was the last one that we did. That was one where I’d actually come in with a drumbeat, and she was like, ‘Oh, I was actually just playing around with chords that could go with that,’ and then the song just quickly moved from there.”\n\nAdds Little, “Lyrically, that song has got so many gut punches in it — just really important lines, I feel. As that song was coming together and we were realizing what it was saying, it was a very emotional aura. The energy in the room was really intense. Knowing the way things have been going in the States lately with all these horrible shootings and everything, for her to be saying these things made it all the more powerful.”\n\nProduction-wise, he says, “That was a fun one. There’s, like, a kids’ choir, and that’s just my two daughters, stepped up over the top of each other singing harmonies with themselves. I had to do it in a way where they weren’t allowed to know that they were singing on a Taylor Swift song, obviously, because there’s a lot of secrecy involved with all this stuff. So I had to sing the parts in a kid’s voice and then get them to sing over the top. They actually don’t even know that it’s going to be in the documentary yet, so I’m excited for them to hear it.” (Let’s hope they aren’t reading it here first.)\n\nWill the song come out as a single? “I don’t see it as a single,” Swift says. “I just see it as a song that goes with this film. I don’t see it as a ‘let’s go make a music video and try to see what this does at radio’ single. I think I’m probably going to keep putting songs out from ‘Lover,’ if I can.” No, no — we, on behalf of fans, want to know if it’ll be available for download or streaming, apart from its place in the documentary? “Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You can listen to it if you want,” she laughs.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift: No Longer ‘Polite at All Costs’\n\nJan 21, 2020 8:30am PT\nBy Chris Willman\n\n“Not a shot. Not a single chance. Not a snowball’s chance in hell.”\n\nTaylor Swift — who, at 30, has reached a Zen state of cheerful realism — laughs as she leans into a pillow she’s placed over her crossed legs inside her suite at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, leaning further still into her infinitesimal odds of winning a Golden Globe, which will zero out when she heads down to the televised ball in a few hours.\n\nNever mind whether or not the tune she co-wrote, “Beautiful Ghosts,” might actually have been worthy of a trophy for best original song (or shortlisted for an Oscar, which it was not). Since the Globe nominations were revealed, voters could hardly have been immune to how quickly the film it’s a part of, “Cats,” in which she also co-stars, became a whipping boy for jokes about costly Hollywood miscalculations and creative disasters. Not that you’ll hear Swift utter a discouraging word about it all. “I’m happy to be here, happy to be nominated, and I had a really great time working on that weird-ass movie,” she declares. “I’m not gonna retroactively decide that it wasn’t the best experience. I never would have met Andrew Lloyd Webber or gotten to see how he works, and now he’s my buddy. I got to work with the sickest dancers and performers. No complaints.”\n\nIf this leads you to believe that the pop superstar is in the business of sugarcoating things, consider her other new movie — a vastly more significant documentary that presents Swift not just sans digital fur but without a whole lot of the varnish of the celebrity-industrial complex. The Netflix-produced “Taylor Swift: Miss Americana” has a prestige slot as the Jan. 23 opening night gala premiere of the Sundance Film Festival before it reaches the world as a day-and-date theatrical release and potential streaming monster on Jan. 31.\n\nThe doc spends much of its opening act juxtaposing the joys of creation with the aggravations of global stardom — the grist of many a pop doc, if rendered in especially intimate detail — before taking a more provocative turn in its last reel to focus more tightly on how and why Swift became a political animal. It’s the story of an earnest young woman with a self-described “good girl” fixation working through her last remaining fears of being shamed as she comes to embrace her claws, and her causes.\n\n\nGiven that the film portrays how gradually, and sometimes reluctantly, Swift came to place herself into service as a social commentator, “Miss Americana” is a portrait of the birth of an activist. Director Lana Wilson sets the movie up so that it pivots on a couple of big letdowns for its subject. The first comes early in the film, and early in the morning, when Swift’s publicist calls to update her on how many of the top three Grammy categories her 2017 album “Reputation” is nominated for: zilch. She’s clearly bummed about the record’s brushoff by the awards’ nominating committee, as just about anyone who’d previously won album of the year twice would be, and determinedly tells her rep that she’s just going to make a better record.\n\nBut she suffers what feels like a more meaningful blow toward the end of the film. In the fall of 2018, Swift finally comes out of the closet politically to intervene on behalf of Democrats in a midterm election in her home state of Tennessee. As the Washington Post put it, this announcement “fell like a hammer across the Trump-worshipping subforums of the far-right Internet, where people had convinced themselves… that the world-famous pop star was a secret MAGA fan.” Donald Trump goes on camera to smirk that he now likes Swift’s music a little less. The singer is successful in enlisting tens of thousands of young people to register to vote, but her senatorial candidate of choice, Democrat Phil Bredesen, loses to Republican Marsha Blackburn, whom she’d called out as a flagrant enemy of feminism and gay rights.\n\n“Definitely, that was a bigger disappointment for me,” Swift says, pitting the midterm snub against the Grammy snub. “I think what’s going on out in the world is bigger than who gets a prize at the party.”\n\nIt was not always thus for Swift — as the detractors who dragged her for staying quiet during the last presidential election eagerly pointed out. If you had to pick the most embarrassing or regrettable moment in “Miss Americana,” it might be the TV clip from “The Late Show With David Letterman” in which the host brings up politics and gets Swift to essentially advocate the “Shut up and sing” mantra. As the studio audience roars approval of her vow to stay apolitical, Letterman gives her what now looks like history’s most dated fist bump.\n\nThinking back on it, Swift is incredulous. “Every time I didn’t speak up about politics as a young person, I was applauded for it,” she says. “It was wild. I said, ‘I’m a 22-year-old girl — people don’t want to hear what I have to say about politics.’ And people would just be like, ‘Yeahhhhh!’”\n\nAt that point, Swift was already starting to record isolated pop tracks, taking baby steps that would soon turn into full strides away from her initial genre. But whether she had designs on switching lanes or not, the lesson of the Dixie Chicks’ forced exile after Natalie Maines’ comment against then-President George W. Bush had branded itself onto her brain at an earlier age, when she’d just planted her young-teen flag in Nashville and overheard a lot of the lamentations of older Music Row songwriters about how the Chicks had thrown it all away.\n\n“I saw how one comment ended such a powerful reign, and it terrified me,” says Swift. “These days, with social media, people can be so mad about something one day and then forget what they were mad about a couple weeks later. That’s fake outrage. But what happened to the Dixie Chicks was real outrage. I registered it — that you’re always one comment away from being done being able to make music.”\n\nMaybe the most transfixing scene in “Miss Americana” is one where Swift argues with her father and other members of her team about the statement she’s about to release coming out against Blackburn and — it’s clear from her references to White House opposition to the Equality Act — Donald Trump too. The comments were so spontaneous that Wilson wasn’t there to film the moment, but the director had asked people to turn on the camera if anything interesting transpired, and here it most certainly did.\n\n“For 12 years, we’ve not got involved in politics or religion,” an unnamed associate says to Swift, suggesting that going down the road of standing against a president as well as Republican gubernatorial and Senate candidates could have the effect of halving her audience on tour. Her father chimes in: “I’ve read the entire [statement] and … right now, I’m terrified. I’m the guy that went out and bought armored cars.”\n\nBut Swift is adamant about pressing the button to send a nearly internet-breaking Instagram post, saying that Blackburn has voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act as well as LGBTQ-friendly bills: “I can’t see another commercial [with] her disguising these policies behind the words ‘Tennessee Christian values.’ I live in Tennessee. I am Christian. That’s not what we stand for.” Pushing back tears, she laments not having come out against Trump two years earlier, “but I can’t change that. … I need to be on the right side of history. … Dad, I need you to forgive me for doing it, because I’m doing it.”\n\nSays Swift now, “This was a situation where, from a humanity perspective, and from what my moral compass was telling me I needed to do, I knew I was right, and I really didn’t care about repercussions.” She understands why she faced such heated opposition in the room: “My dad is terrified of threats against my safety and my life, and he has to see how many stalkers we deal with on a daily basis, and know that this is his kid. It’s where he comes from.”\n\nSwift was recently announced as the recipient of a Vanguard Award from GLAAD, and she name-checked the org in her basher-bashing single “You Need to Calm Down,” which was released as one of the teaser tracks for last fall’s more outwardly directed and socially conscious “Lover” album. Part of her politicization, she says, is feeling it would be hypocritical to hang out with her gay friends while leaving them to their own devices politically. In the film, she says, “I think it is so frilly and spineless of me to stand onstage and go ‘Happy Pride Month, you guys,’ and then not say this, when someone’s literally coming for their neck.”\n\nA year and a half later, she elaborates: “To celebrate but not advocate felt wrong for me. Using my voice to try to advocate was the only choice to make. Because I’ve talked about equality and sung about it in songs like ‘Welcome to New York,’ but we are at a point where human rights are being violated. When you’re saying that certain people can be kicked out of a restaurant because of who they love or how they identify, and these are actual policies that certain politicians vocally stand behind, and they disguise them as family values, that is sinister. So, so dark.”\n\nHer increasing alignment with the LGBTQ community wasn’t the only thing raising her consciousness to a breaking — i.e., speaking — point. So did the sexual assault trial in which judgment was rendered that she had been groped by a DJ in a backstage photo op (for financial restitution, Swift had asked for $1).\n\nHer experience with the trial was crucial, she says, in finding herself “needing to speak up about beliefs I’d always had, because it felt like an opportunity to shed light on what those trials are like. I experienced it as a person with extreme privilege, so I can only imagine what it’s like when you don’t have that. And I think one theme that ended up emerging in the film is what happens when you are not just a people pleaser but someone who’s always been respectful of authority figures, doing what you were supposed to do, being polite at all costs. I still think it’s important to be polite, but not at all costs,” she says. “Not when you’re being pushed beyond your limits, and not when people are walking all over you. I needed to get to a point where I was ready, able and willing to call out bulls— rather than just smiling my way through it.”\n\nThat came into play when Kanye West stepped into her life and publicly shamed her a second time. In the video Kim Kardashian released in 2016, you can hear the people-pleasing Swift on the other end of the line sheepishly thanking him for letting her know about the “Me and Taylor might still have sex” line he plans to include about her in a song — only to regret it later when the eventual track also includes the claim “Why? I made that bitch famous.” The boast, of course, referred back to the moment when he interrupted her and stole her spotlight at the MTV VMAs six years earlier as she was in the middle of an acceptance speech. West’s is not a name that ever publicly escapes Swift’s lips, so it might be surprising to fans that these events are recapped in “Miss Americana,” although Swift says the filmic decisions were all up to the director, who explains that Swift’s reaction to the episode was important to include.\n\n\n“With the 2009 VMAs, it surprised me that when she talked about how the whole crowd was booing, she thought that they were booing her, and how devastating that was,” says Wilson. “That was something I hadn’t thought about or heard before, and made it much more relatable and understandable to anyone.”\n\nSwift acknowledges how formative both incidents have been in her life, for ill and good. “As a teenager who had only been in country music, attending my very first pop awards show,” she says now, “somebody stood up and sent me the message: ‘You are not respected here. You shouldn’t be here on this stage.’ That message was received, and it burrowed into my psyche more than anyone knew. … That can push you one of two ways: I could have just curled up and decided I’m never going to one of those events ever again, or it could make me work harder than anyone expects me to, and try things no one expected, and crave that respect — and hopefully one day get it.\n\n“But then when that person who sparked all of those feelings comes back into your life, as he did in 2015, and I felt like I finally got that respect (from West), but then soon realized that for him it was about him creating some revisionist history where he was right all along, and it was correct, right and decent for him to get up and do that to a teenage girl…” She sighs. “I understand why Lana put it in.”\n\nAdds the woman who started her recent “Lover” album with a West-allusive romp that’s pointedly called “I Forgot That You Existed”: “I don’t think too hard about this stuff now.”\n\nWhat’s not in the film is any mention of her other most famous nemeses — Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta of Big Machine Records, with whom she’s scrapped publicly for several months. “The Big Machine stuff happened pretty late in our process,” says Wilson. “We weren’t that far from picture lock. But there’s also not much to say that isn’t publicly known. I feel like Taylor’s put the story out there in her own words already, and it’s been widely covered. I was interested in telling the story that hadn’t been told before, that would be surprising and emotionally powerful to audiences whether they were music industry people or not.”\n\nStill, the way Swift has been willing to stand up politically for others parallels the manner in which she stood up for herself in regard to Braun, et al., at the recent Billboard Women in Music Awards, where she gave an altogether blistering speech, naming names and taking no prisoners, going after the men who now control her six-album Big Machine back catalog. Certainly Swift was aware that, along with supporters, there were many friends and business associates of Braun among the VIPs in the Hollywood Palladium who would not be pleased with what this very reformed people-pleaser had to say.\n\n\nOne thing everyone who was in the room agrees on is that you could hear a pin drop as Swift used the speech to get even bolder about the meat of these disputes. Some would say it’s because they were riveted by her boldness in speaking truth to power, others because they just felt uncomfortable. Says one fellow honoree who works in a high position in the industry (and who’s worked with some high-profile Braun clients): “People were excited for her at the beginning of the speech. But once she started going in a negative direction at an event that is supposed to be celebrating accomplishments and rah-rah for women, I felt it fell flat with a good portion of the room, because it wasn’t the appropriate place to be saying it.”\n\nWasn’t it intimidating for Swift, knowing she might be polarizing an auditorium full of the most powerful people in the business? “Well, I do sleep well at night knowing that I’m right,” she responds, “and knowing that in 10 years it will have been a good thing that I spoke about artists’ rights to their art, and that we bring up conversations like: Should record deals maybe be for a shorter term, or how are we really helping artists if we’re not giving them the first right of refusal to purchase their work if they want to?”\n\n“Obviously, anytime you’re standing up against or for anything, you’re never going to receive unanimous praise. But that’s what forces you to be brave. And that’s what’s different about the way I live my life now.” (Braun’s camp could not be reached for comment.)\n\n\nOne thing Taylor Swift can’t bend to her determined will is her family’s health. She revealed a few years ago that her mother, Andrea, a beloved figure among the thousands of fans who’ve met her at road shows, is battling an undisclosed type of cancer. Swift addressed the uncertainty of that struggle in an anguished song on her latest album, “Soon You’ll Get Better.” Many who view “Miss Americana” will look for signs of how her mom is doing. The subject comes up in a section of the film that includes a relatively light-hearted scene in in which it’s shown that one of Andrea Swift’s ways of saying “eff you” to cancer recently was to break the mold and bring a canine — her “cancer dog” — into a famously feline-friendly family.\n\nThe real answer may come in Swift’s touring activity for “Lover.” Whereas typically she’d spend nine months in the year after an album release on the road, she plans to limit herself to four stadium dates in America this summer and a trip around the festival circuit in Europe. This may not be 100% for personal reasons: “I wanted to be able to perform in places that I hadn’t performed in as much, and to do things I hadn’t done before, like Glastonbury,” she says. “I feel like I haven’t done festivals, really, since early in my career — they’re fun and bring people together in a really cool way. But I also wanted to be able to work as much as I can handle right now, with everything that’s going on at home. And I wanted to figure out a way that I could do both those things.”\n\nIs being able to be there for her mother the main concern? “Yeah, that’s it. That’s the reason,” she says. “I mean, we don’t know what is going to happen. We don’t know what treatment we’re going to choose. It just was the decision to make at the time, for right now, for what’s going on.”\n\nIn her case, it’s as if her manager had taken seriously ill as well as the person she’s always been closest to, all at once. “Everyone loves their mom; everyone’s got an important mom,” she allows. “But for me, she’s really the guiding force. Almost every decision I make, I talk to her about it first. So obviously it was a really big deal to ever speak about her illness.” During filming, when Andrea’s cancer had returned for a second time, “she was going through chemo, and that’s a hard enough thing for a person to go through.” Then it got harder. Speaking about this latest development publicly for the first time, Swift quietly reveals: “While she was going through treatment, they found a brain tumor. And the symptoms of what a person goes through when they have a brain tumor is nothing like what we’ve ever been through with her cancer before. So it’s just been a really hard time for us as a family.”\n\n\nCompared with that, nearly any other topic the movie might address would pale. But it finds weightiness in addressing other kinds of unhealthiness, like the physical expectations that are placed on women in general and celebrity women specifically, Swift being no exception. In this department, she has her own heroines. “I love people like Jameela Jamil, because the way she speaks about body image, it’s almost like she speaks in a hook. Women are held to such a ridiculous standard of beauty, and we’re seeing so much on social media that makes us feel like we are less than, or we’re not what we should be, that you kind of need a mantra to repeat in your head when you start to have unhealthy thoughts. I swear the way Jameela speaks is like lyrics — it gets stuck in my head and it calms me down.”\n\nSwift’s collaborator in this messaging, Wilson, was on a list of potential directors Netflix gave her when she expressed interest in possibly doing a documentary to follow the concert special that premiered on the service just over a year ago. You could discern a feminist message, if you chose to, in the fact that Swift chose a director most well known for a documentary about abortion providers, “After Tiller.” Swift says she was most impressed, though, that Wilson’s docs look for nuance and subtlety in addressing subjects that do lend themselves to soapboxes, and their first conversation was about their mutual desire to avoid “propaganda” in any form.\n\nIf there’s a feminist agenda in “Miss Americana,” Wilson and Swift wanted it to emerge naturally, although the director admits it was pretty blatant from the outset, given that she set up the film (which is co-produced by Morgan Neville, the director’s “sounding board”) with an all-female crew. Or nearly all-female, says Wilson, laughing, “I will say that we did always have male production assistants, because I like trying to show people that men can fetch coffee for women.”\n\nAdds Wilson, “When I started filming, it was before she’d come out politically. She knew that she was coming out of a very dark period, and wanted collaborate on something that captured what she was going through and that was really raw and honest and emotionally intimate.” The political awakening, the director says, “was a profound decision for her to make. In that, I saw this feminist coming of age story that I personally connected with, and that I really think women and girls around the world will see themselves in.”\n\nThe film borrows its title from a song on the “Lover” album, “Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince,” that’s maybe the one fully allegorical song Swift has ever released — and, in its fashion, is a great protest song. The entire lyric is a metaphor for how Swift grew up as an unblinking patriot and has had to reluctantly leave behind her naiveté in the age of Trump. Her partner on that track, as well as other message songs like “You Need to Calm Down” and “The Man,” was a co-writer and co-producer new to her stable of collaborators this time around, Joel Little.\n\n\nWith the song “Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince,” although the lyrics are cloaked in metaphor, “We like to think it was a very clear statement,” Little says. “There are lots of little hidden messages within that song that are all pointing toward the way that she thinks and feels about politics and the United States. I love that it uses a lot of classic Taylor Swift imagery, in terms of the songwriting topics of high school and cheerleaders, as a clever nod to what she’s done in the past, but tied in with a heavy political message.”\n\n“Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince” doesn’t actually appear in the documentary, but the director says the film’s title is understood by fans as an obvious reference to political themes in the number. “Even if you don’t know the song,” Wilson says, “I see the movie as looking at the flip side of being America’s sweetheart, so I like how the title evokes that too.”\n\nThe doc doesn’t lack for its own protest songs though. In the wake of her midterm disappointment, Swift is seen writing an anthem for millennials who might have come away disillusioned with the political process. That previously unheard song, “Only the Young,” is seen being demo-ed before it plays in full over the end credits; it’ll be released as a digital single in conjunction with the doc. (See a full story on the new song here.) Key lyric: ““You did all that you could do / The game was rigged, the ref got tricked/ The wrong ones think they’re right / We were outnumbered — this time.”\n\n“One thing I think is amazing about her,” says Wilson, “is that she goes to the studio and to songwriting as a place to process what she’s going through. I loved how, when she got the Grammy news (about “Reputation”), this isn’t someone who’s going to feel sorry for herself or say ‘That wasn’t right.’ She’s like, ‘Okay, I’m going to work even harder.’ You see her strength of character in that moment when she gets that news. And then with the election results, I loved how she channeled so many of her thoughts and feelings into ‘Only the Young.’ It was a great way to kind of show how stuff that happens in her life goes directly into the songs; you get to witness that in both cases.\n\nSo is the film aimed at satisfying the fan base or teasing the unconvinced hordes who might dial it up as a free stream? “I think it’s a little bit of both,” Swift says. “I chose Netflix because it’s a very vast, accessible medium to people who are just like, ‘Hey, what’s this? I’m bored.’ I love that, because I do so many things that cater specifically to fans that like my music, I think it’s important to put yourself out there to people who don’t care at all about you.”\n\n\nIn the wake of the last round of Kanye-gate, stung by the backlash of those who took his side, Swift took a three-year break from interviews. The mantra of her 2017 album “Reputation” and subsequent tour was “No explanations.” But her Beyoncé-style press blackout was a passing phase. With “Lover” and now, especially, the documentary, she could hardly be more about the explanations. Although this interview is the only one she currently plans to do about the documentary, it’s clear that she’s come back into a season of openness, and that she considers it her natural habitat.\n\n“I really like the whole discussion around music. And during ‘Reputation,’ it never felt like it was ever going to be about music, no matter what I said or did,” she says. “I approach albums differently, in how I want to show them to the world or what I feel comfortable with at that time in my life.” Being more transparent “feels great with this album. I really feel like I could just keep making stuff — it’s that vibe right now. I don’t think I’ve ever written this much. That’s exhibited in ‘Lover’ having the most songs that I’ve ever had on an album” (18, to be exact). “But even after I made the album, I kept writing and going in the studio. That’s a new thing I’ve experienced this time around. That openness kind of feels like you finally got the lid off a jar you’ve been working at for years.”\n\nCipher-dom never could have stood for long for someone who’s established herself as one of the most accomplished confessional singer-songwriters in pop history. “I don’t really operate very well as an enigma,” she says. “It’s not fulfilling to me. It works really well in a lot of pop careers, but I think that it makes me feel completely unable to do what I had gotten in this to do, which is to communicate to people. I live for the feeling of standing on a stage and saying, ‘I feel this way,’ and the crowd responding with ‘We do too!’ And me being like, ‘Really?’ And they’re like, ‘Yes!’”\n\nSwift believes talking things up again isn’t a form of giving in to narcissism — it’s a way of warding off commodification.\n\n“The bigger your career gets, the more you struggle with the idea that a lot of people see you the same way they see an iPhone or a Starbucks,” she muses. “They’ve been inundated with your name in the media, and you become a brand. That’s inevitable for me, but I do think that it’s really necessary to feel like I can still communicate with people. And as a songwriter, it’s really important to still feel human and process things in a human way. The through line of all that is humanity, and reaching out and talking to people and having them see things that aren’t cute.\n\n\n“There’s a lot that’s not cute in this documentary.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "❗TRIGGER WARNING: DISCUSSION OF ED❗\n\nTaylor Swift Opens Up About Overcoming Struggle With Eating Disorder (EXCLUSIVE)\nTaylor Swift tells Variety more about \"how unhealthy that's been for me — my relationship with food,\" a subject boldly broached in her Sundance documentary, \"Miss Americana.\"\n\n\nJan 23, 2020 8:47pm PT\nBy Chris Willman\n\nIn the new Taylor Swift documentary, “Miss Americana,” which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival Thursday night, there’s a montage of derogatory commentary about the singer that has appeared on cable shows over the years. One of the less nasty remarks: “She’s too skinny. It bothers me.”\n\nAs it turns out, it eventually bothered Swift, too.\n\nIn one of the most revealing and surprising segments of the Netflix film, Swift talks for several minutes about having struggled in the past with an eating disorder.\n\nAfter being pictured facing a phalanx of photographers after she emerges from her front door, Swift is heard in voiceover saying that “it’s not good for me to see pictures of myself every day.” Although she says “it’s only happened a few times, and I’m not in any way proud of it,” Swift admits there have been times in the past when she’s seen “a picture of me where I feel like I looked like my tummy was too big, or… someone said that I looked pregnant … and that’ll just trigger me to just starve a little bit — just stop eating.”\n\nSwift elaborated on what she’s gone through with that in her interview with Variety for this week’s cover story, saying that it was difficult for her to speak up about it for the documentary.\n\n“I didn’t know if I was going to feel comfortable with talking about body image and talking about the stuff I’ve gone through in terms of how unhealthy that’s been for me — my relationship with food and all that over the years,” she tells Variety. “But the way that Lana (Wilson, the film’s director) tells the story, it really makes sense. I’m not as articulate as I should be about this topic because there are so many people who could talk about it in a better way. But all I know is my own experience. And my relationship with food was exactly the same psychology that I applied to everything else in my life: If I was given a pat on the head, I registered that as good. If I was given a punishment, I registered that as bad.”\n\nIn the quiet of a hotel suite, she goes into greater detail on how formative an effect that one early tabloid torpedo had on her. “I remember how, when I was 18, that was the first time I was on the cover of a magazine,” she says. “And the headline was like ‘Pregnant at 18?’ And it was because I had worn something that made my lower stomach look not flat. So I just registered that as a punishment. And then I’d walk into a photo shoot and be in the dressing room and somebody who worked at a magazine would say, ‘Oh, wow, this is so amazing that you can fit into the sample sizes. Usually we have to make alterations to the dresses, but we can take them right off the runway and put them on you!’ And I looked at that as a pat on the head. You register that enough times, and you just start to accommodate everything towards praise and punishment, including your own body.”\n\nShe hesitates. “I think I’ve never really wanted to talk about that before, and I’m pretty uncomfortable talking about it now,” she says quietly. “But in the context of every other thing that I was doing or not doing in my life, I think it makes sense” to have it in the film, she says.\n\nWilson, the director, is proud of Swift for taking up the subject with such candor. “That’s one of my favorite sequences of the film,” she says. “I was surprised, of course. But I love how she’s kind of thinking out loud about it. And every woman will see themselves in that sequence. I just have no doubt.”\n\nThe filmmaker points out that there were clearly plenty of people who didn’t think Swift was too thin back in the mid-2010s. “You can also just not notice people being really skinny, because we’re all so accustomed to seeing women on magazine covers who are unhealthy-skinny, and that’s become normalized.” Even with non-celebrities, Wilson says, everybody’s a body critic. “It’s incessant, and I can say this as a woman: It’s amazing to me how people are constantly like ‘You look skinny’ or ‘You’ve gained weight.’ People you barely know say this to you. And it feels awful, and you can’t win either way. So I think it’s really brave to see someone who is a role model for so many girls and women be really honest about that. I think it will have a huge impact.”\n\nAs much as Swift may be seen as a role model for speaking frankly on the subject, she’s got her own favorite artist, so to speak, when it comes to advocacy for women’s bodily self-image issues.\n\n“I love people like (actress and activist) Jameela Jamil, because she says things in a really articulate way,” the singer tells us. “The way she speaks about body image, it’s almost like she speaks in a hook. If you read her quotes about women and body image and aging and the way that women are treated in our industry and portrayed in the media, I swear the way she speaks is like lyrics, and it gets stuck in my head and it calms me down. Because women are held to such a ridiculous standard of beauty. We’re seeing so much on social media that makes us feel like we are less than, or we’re not what we should be, that you kind of need a mantra to repeat in your head when you start to have harmful or unhealthy thoughts. So she’s one of the people who, when I read what she says, it sticks with me and it helps me.”\n\nIn the film, then-and-now photos illustrate just how thin Swift had gotten during the “1989” era, versus the healthier look she sported by the time she toured behind the “Reputation” album in 2018. Swift says that her under-eating in that earlier time severely affected her stamina on tour.\n\n“I thought that I was supposed to feel like I was going to pass out at the end of a show, or in the middle of it,” she attests in the documentary. “Now I realize, no, if you eat food, have energy, get stronger, you can do all these shows and not feel (enervated).” Swift says she doesn’t care so much now if someone comments on a weight gain, and she’s reconciled “the fact that I’m a size 6 instead of a size double-zero.” Swift says she was completely unaware that anything was wrong in her double-zero era, and had a defense at the ready should it come up. If anyone expressed concern, she’d say, “‘What are you talking about? Of course I eat. …. I exercise a lot.’ And I did exercise a lot. But I wasn’t eating.”\n\nFew women viewing the film will fail to nod their heads as Swift describes the impossibility of any body shape or size living up to all the standards for beauty. “If you’re thin enough, then you don’t have that ass that everybody wants,” she says in the film. “But if you have enough weight on you to have an ass, your stomach isn’t flat enough. It’s all just f—ing impossible.” As she became aware of the problem, Swift says in the film, it would cause her to “go into a real shame/hate spiral.”\n\nThe word “shame” comes up elsewhere in conversation with Swift, who by virtue of becoming one of the most celebrated women in the world has also had to deal with more catty comments than almost any celebrity in the world — and hasn’t always succeeded in shaking it all off.\n\n“I was watching a Netflix Brené Brown special on shame, because I read a lot of her books, because I have dealings with shame every once in awhile,” Swift tells Variety. “She was saying something like, ‘It’s ridiculous to say “I don’t care what anyone thinks about me,” because that’s not possible. But you can decide whose opinions matter more and whose opinions you put more weight on.’ And I think that is really part of growing up, if you’re going to do it right. That’s part of hoping to find some sort of maturity and balance in your life.”\n\nShe continues, “I don’t expect anyone with a pop career to learn how to do that within the first 10 years. And I know that there’s a lot of bad stuff that’s gone on recently, a lot of really hard stuff my family is going through, and a lot of opposition and feeling pressure or suppression of one kind or another. But I am actually really happy. Because I pick and choose now, for the most part, what I care deeply about. And I think that’s made a huge difference.”\n\n",

      "Transcript/Content": "Exclusive: Here's Exactly How Taylor Swift's \"You Need to Calm Down\" Was Made\nExclusive! \"You Need to Calm Down\" co-writer and producer Joel Little pulls back the curtain on creating the Grammy-nominated track with Taylor Swift.\nBy Billy Nilles Jan 26, 2020 1:00 PM| Updated Jan 24, 2020 11:33 PM\n\nWhen Taylor Swift unveiled \"You Need to Calm Down\" as the second single from her seventh studio album, Lover, last June, anticipation was at a near-fever pitch.\n\nLead single \"ME!\" had keyed fans in to the new sound the superstar was exploring for the LP, her first to be released after departing Big Machine Records for a landmark deal with Universal Music Group that allowed for full ownership of her material for the first time in her career, and the buoyant, bright track stood in marked contrast to the darker sounds of its predecessor, 2017's reputation.\n\nThe song, made with new collaborator Joel Little (best known for his work on Lorde's debut album Pure Heroine) and featuring Panic! at the Disco frontman Brandon Urie, had stalled at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, kept from the pole position thanks to a little track called \"Old Town Road\" that dominated the chart for 19 consecutive weeks last year. And Swifties were hungry for more.\n\nSo when the track, also co-written and produced by Little, debuted on June 14, they gobbled it up, allowing for it to debut at No. 2. And as they listened, it became clear this wasn't entirely business as usual.\n\nDid she just reference GLAAD? Did she say \"his\" gown? \n\nBy the song's second verse, the song had quickly turned from calling out her own haters (of which there had been a few over the years) to taking on those who make it their mission to torment the LGBTQ community on the daily. \n\n\"You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace/And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate,\" she sang. \"'Cause shade never made anybody less gay.\"\n\nIt was one thing for Swift to lay bare her politics on social media, as she had months earlier as the 2018 midterms approached, but for the first time, she was taking a decidedly political stance in her music. That the track was released smack-dab in the middle of Pride Month on the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising was no coincidence. The accompanying video, released three days later, drove that point home, what with its parade of LGBTQ celebrity cameos and urging of viewers to sign her Change.org petition for the U.S. Senate to pass the Equality Act.\n\nSwift's newfound activism wasn't lost on listeners, whether they were longtime fans or entering her orbit for the first time thanks to the showing of support. The song spent 12 consecutive weeks in the top 20, her longest duration since before reputation. It won her two MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year and one American Music Award for Favorite Music Video. And it earned her one of a (shamefully low) three nominations at the 62nd Grammy Awards, taking place on Sunday, Jan. 26 in Los Angeles, for Best Pop Solo Performance. (Lover is up for Best Pop Vocal Album, while its title track scored a Song of the Year nod.)\n\nAs Little, who met Swift at a Broods concert before reconnecting while she was on tour in his native New Zealand, told E! News exclusively, the foray into music with a message was all the superstar's doing.\n\n\"I've got to give her full credit for that,\" he said. \"That was all her and her voice and something that she felt was really important for her to say. I think, initially, she sent me a voice memo, just texted me a voice memo of her singing the chorus melody into her phone. Before we even got together, she'd come up with that melody. And so I immediately pulled the audio file into a Pro Tools session and started building the music around it so that by the time she got into the studio a lot of the idea was almost there already.\"\n\nAs Little explained, striking the right tone for the track was of chief importance. \"And she's always great with direction in terms of the tone of things,\" he said. \"The fact that it is a bop and you can dance to it is really important because you don't want a song like that to be, you know, too preachy or annoying. I think there's a fine line there...I think it does a great job.\"\n\nWhile the song garnered much of its attention for its pro-LGBTQ message, by the time it hits its bridge, it finds Swift throwing her support behind all the women in pop music, letting the misogynists on Twitter know that they won't be divided anymore. (That message was driven home in the video, as well, when she and Katy Perry put their feud behind them, at long last, for a hug while dressed as French fries and a hamburger, respectively.)\n\nBut as Little revealed, the bridge that we know and love almost wasn't. \"I think there was, originally, a different idea for the bridge,\" he said without elaborating on what those initial plans were. \"But I think it just lyrically felt like there was still something important to be said there. You know, having a bridge that just kind of fills in a little bit of space before you can get to that last chorus is all well and good, but it's always nice that you can have it kind of be its own its own idea itself and have it stand on its own.\"\n\n\"And so I think putting the time in to get that right was important and definitely kind of helps the song overall,\" he continued. \"You know, that's the part where she's bringing everybody together and saying 'We're all in this and we all deal with this and, you know, we're gonna stick together,' which I think is a great, great thing to say and an important thing to say.\"\n\nDespite the bridge taking time to get right, Little made clear that Swift's approach to songwriting is, well, swift and in a league of its own. \"I mean, she's one of the all-time greats, for sure, when it comes to songwriting. She always comes in with ideas,\" he told us. \"It's always—you can really hear in her songs that it's her voice, melodically and lyrically, you know? Even if we miraculously managed to come up with something that can improve on what she already has, which can be quite rare because she's so good already. I think that it's just undeniably her every time, with every song that she does.\"\n\nAs such, Little's hesitant to take much credit for any of the Lover tracks he worked on, which also include \"The Man\" and \"Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince.\" The fact that three of the four happen to be the album's most overtly political, he says, had nothing to do with him.\n\n\"I don't know if I can take too much credit for that. You know, that was done over a period of time. They weren't all done in the same—they were done in separate sessions over a few months. And so I guess it was just, you know, that's was where she was at the time,\" he told us. \"I know that there's things that she has felt strongly about for a long time. And I don't know, maybe now, lyrically, she just felt like she was in the right place to say it in the way that she wanted and to do her thoughts justice in that way.\"\n\n\"And then, you know, I think for me, I was able to help tell the story and the way that she wanted it to be told, sonically and whatever else,\" he continued. \"But it's all her. I'm not in there going, 'Hey, you should write a song about the state of America today.' [Laughs] She's the one that the idea. And, you know, I just helped her develop it.\"\n\nAs for watching \"You Need to Calm Down\" become the cultural moment it was, and to see the rest of his contributions to the album be so warmly received, Little couldn't be happier. \"It's just the best feeling in the world. We put a lot of time and effort into the songs and we make sure that we love them ourselves,\" he said. \"Because there's no guarantee that songs are going to do amazingly well every time, you know? So it's important that we're releasing something that we're proud of regardless.\"\n\n\"But I think, especially with Taylor, you know that she's going to come to the party with the craziest video every time. And that's all her ideas. She's co-directing the videos and coming up with the concepts. It's just so fun. She'll always tell me beforehand, 'I've got this idea.' Talk me through her pitch for the videos,\" he continued. \"So I was really excited to see those videos and they didn't disappoint. Just having them come out and have the reaction that they did. When you've put in all that work, that's kind of the ideal situation to have people love it as much as you do.\"\n\nNo need to calm down here.",

      "Transcript/Content": "[OG Paywalled, unclear if this is a complete transcript] “I first met Taylor Swift when I played a writers’ room at a record label and she was there,” she revealed. “She heard a couple of my songs and asked if I would write with her. That’s what I’ve learned in this business: you’re never too big to write with a new artist. We had a great time the first day we wrote and we just kept writing and writing. There’s nothing like songwriting with her.\n\n“Did I think she’d become the biggest star in the world? You don’t think that, but I did know that she was special. With her drive and her talent, I knew that she was going to do something, absolutely.”\n\nRose would end up writing 17 of the songs that Swift has released in her career thus far, starting with Tim McGraw, her debut single, in 2006, and ending with All Too Well.\n\n“For All Too Well, she called me, said she had an idea and she really wanted me to help her sort it out,” recalls Rose. She also remembers that, unsurprisingly given the song’s eventual journey, one of the things she was tasked with was reducing the running time.\n\n“Artists know I’m going to get the story out of them and help them be true to their artistry,” believes Rose. “It was a 20-minute long song at the time so I had to help her look at the pieces and say, ‘This needs to go here, this is important’, listen to her and grab the important lines.\n\n“We had a really good day sorting the song out. It’s a great memory to have watched her dig that out. It’s the best song we did together.”\n\nHow did the writing session actually work, though? “We got in the zone and just bounced it back and forth,” Rose explains. “She would start playing a melody and [singing] dummy words. With Taylor, it’s about getting the emotion out in a song and if it resonates and it’s going to fit on a record, great. Sometimes when we wrote, it did and sometimes it didn’t - and sometimes the ones I thought were maybe better than others didn’t ever make records! But All Too Well was a ping-pong match, pretty effortless and joyful.\n\n“I remember the ‘You call me up again just to break me like a promise/So casually cruel in the name of being honest’ line just falling out of her face. I was writing it down as fast as I could. The emotion hit her and those lines came out.\n\nRed, of course, is widely recognised as the album on which Swift moved away from her country roots and into the musical mainstream, but this future career trajectory isn’t something that she discussed with Rose at the time.\n\n“I believe this was the first song she wrote for Red. But I don’t think she was deliberately ‘going pop’ when we were writing All Too Well, she was just writing songs,” she says. “Then she went to LA and wrote with Max Martin and it just morphed into that. But she’s always been a little pop!”\n\nWhat of the future, though - is it possible that Rose could end up working with Swift again? \n\n“We’re still in touch through people but she just has a different life now,” Rose admits. “We have tremendous love and respect for each other and you never know. I always say, ‘I’d be shocked if we did write together again, and I’d be shocked if we didn’t’. She’s fantastic and I’m always excited to see what she does next; she just continues to grow and that’s hard for an artist that starts that young.”\n\nWhatever happens, thanks to her involvement in All Too Well, Rose is part of Swift folklore for evermore, and that’s clearly something she takes great pride in.\n\n“I still choke up when I hear that song,” she confirms. “It’s funny, because [the original version] was never a single, but it still resonated. I love it when they do a fan poll for people’s favourite Taylor songs and they pick All Too Well at No 1. It’s like, “Oh man, that is so cool”.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Reveals How She's Staying Occupied During Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nBy Desiree Murphy\nPublished: 11:12 AM PDT, April 3, 2020\n\nThe singer kicked off her SiriusXM 'Hits 1 n chill' Home DJ special on Friday.\nTaylor Swift is doing her part in practicing social distancing, but still entertaining her fans!\n\nThe 30-year-old singer teamed up with SiriusXM to launch a Hits 1 n chill Home DJ special that kicked off on Friday, as a way to keep everyone \"company during self-isolation.\" Throughout the first hour-long radio show, Swift revealed what she's been doing to stay occupied while quarantined in order to help prevent the further spread of COVID-19, commonly known as the coronavirus.\n\n\"It's safe to say we are living through unprecedented times right now. I am hoping that all of you are safe and healthy,\" Swift said. \"A lot of my friends and I have been doing sort of a weekly family FaceTime, which is always hilarious. I think it's really important that we all stay connected because isolation doesn't have to be an all-encompassing thing. We may be isolated, physically, but we can still keep in touch with people. We can still play games with our friends and family on our phones ... that is one of the great things about modern technology.\"\n\n\"Obviously we have a lot of time on our hands right now, with people being out of school, out of work. I've been doing a lot of cooking, a lot of reading, a lot of watching films that I've never seen before,\" she continued, revealing she just watched Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window for the first time. \"But mostly I've been online trying to figure out how to help others and just constantly in awe of our first responders, emergency workers and our healthcare professionals that are putting themselves in danger every single day.\"\n\nSwift said she's been hearing about plenty of outreach online, and loves that people are continuing to show up for each other during this unique time.\n\n\"I hope you guys are doing a lot of self-care in terms of staying connected to the people that remind you of home, even if the situation is strange and really confusing at this moment,\" she said. \"One thing I think that has been really encouraging to me is going online and seeing that a lot of people are banding together and helping each other. Whether that's monetary or just offering words of support, it's a crazy time right now and you never know who might be struggling, who might be feeling alone.\"\n\n\"Reach out to friends you haven't talked to in a while,\" she advised. \"I think right now we have to connect with our humanity more than we ever have before.\"\n\nSwift also played some of the most requested pop hits -- like Harry Styles' \"Adore You,\" Ariana Grande's \"Into You\" and Justin Bieber's \"Intentions\" -- along with her new personal favorite jams.\n\n\"I can recommend some music I've been listening to. Basically, I've been obsessed with the Conan Gray album,\" she exclaimed. \"I think it's so imaginative, so interesting. It's called Kid Krow and my favorite song on it is called 'Wish You Were Sober.' So go check that out if you want some new, cool music to listen to.\"\n\nGray quickly got word of Swift's shout-out, and couldn't contain his excitement on Twitter.\n\n\"MISS TAYLOR ALISON SWIFT, YOU HAVE OFFICIALLY KILLED ME, CONAN LEE GRAY,\" he wrote. \"I HOPE YOU ARE HAPPY, AS I AM NOW DEAD. IT WAS A GOOD WAY TO DIE, THANK YOU.\"\n\nSwift also praised pal Halsey's \"You Should Be Sad,\" saying, \"I absolutely love this song. I love this girl.\"\n\nEarlier this week, a source confirmed to ET that Swift has been supplying Grimey's New & Preloved Music, a record store in Nashville, with money for each employee, along with three months' worth of health care, in order to help them stay afloat amid economic struggles caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAccording to Rolling Stone, who was first to report the news, Grimey's was one of many local stores that had to send its employees home last month after Nashville's mayor, John Cooper, issued a stay-at-home order.\n\n\"We were very surprised, and I would have to say amazed, that Taylor Swift reached out to us through her publicist to offer some relief during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Doyle Davis, co-owner of Grimey's, told the outlet. \"I didn't even know we were on her radar, but she really stepped up to help after the recent tornadoes that struck Nashville and middle Tennessee, and now she's trying to help a beloved small business in her city.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "I thought we were going to walk in and start something from scratch because that's what I was used to. Then she calls me and says, 'Is it cool if I already have an idea?' I said, 'Sure.' She said, 'I have this song, I'm obsessed with New York and I just moved there, I want to write an ode to New York because no one's done it in a long time.' And then she sent me a voice memo. She's like, 'I want it to sound like 1980s.' So the next day I brought in a Juno-106, which is a very 1980s keyboard and I literally programmed that entire song right in front of her. It was very much on the fly, and that song was done in about three hours. And I did the rest of the production I think later that week. I was in Switzerland on a tour bus, and I did four versions of 'Welcome to New York,' one of which I liked personally more, but the thing about artists is they become very obsessed with the demo. She was in love with the demo so no matter how hard I fought, she brought it back to the demo, so really what you hear is what I did on the first day. And then the fine folks at Illumination played the entire song as the opening for Secret Life of Pets and that was the jewel on the crown because my kids obviously loved that movie.",

      "Transcript/Content": "“That [his working relationship with Taylor] is specifically the type of ideal relationship, that’s why I think I’ve done 8 videos with her - because there is no record company, it’s just literally her and me. Whenever we do a video there is literally no one else involved in it, it’s just a dialogue between her and I. If I do an edit, if I do a shot or anything, there’s no approval process, it’s just that she and I just see eye to eye. That’s why I think those videos came out so great. It’s just two creative people getting to be creative, which is a very unusual situation in such a big world like the record industry where you’re trying to sell billions of records. [On LWYMMD] I think it’s a pretty collaborative effort where she and I will pitch each other ideas. Generally sometimes she comes in with a general thing that she would like to do and then I will respond with my version of it, and maybe translate it. On LWYMMD she had the song… Actually, you know what - on that one I actually met with her in Texas during the Superbowl. I met with her in a trailer, cause she was performing there and she actually played like five or six songs for me. And we were talking about different ideas for particular songs and LWYMMD was the one that we literally decided in the trailer - as we were listening to it - that that would be the first single. [On what public doesn’t get to see about Taylor] Gosh, you know what - the weirdest thing about her is she is kinda who you see. Her entire life is kind of an open book, so I feel like the person that I’ve worked with, with the person that the public generally knows - is who she is. Actually I told Taylor that one of the biggest problems with her is that she explains herself so well that she doesn’t give room for everyone else to interpret - like a lot of artists say nothing and then they are ciphers that you write whatever you wanted to it, but Taylor will likely say, ‘This is who I am.’ And it is who she is. [On favorite video he directed] Well, it is like picking a child, but last night I was watching Taylor Swift’s Wildest Dreams, and I think just by the production level of going to Africa, with the scale of that thing and the way that I feel like I told a narrative story all the way through - that video is gonna be pretty hard to beat.”",

She has built an empire on Songbird level music, but also you don’t kinda get to that level without a scratch on you media-wise without actually being a really nice person. And she really is. We met through my ex very briefly at Disney once, and then out of the blue she texts me and was like, ‘Hey, would you ever think of being in a music video?’ And I was like maybe, like I just finished a film so I wasn’t working but I was a bit like, ‘Yeah, depends who is it for?’ And she said, ‘Oh, it would be for me.’ And I went, ‘Yeah, okay, I’ll do it.’ She was the most supportive - cause I was nervous, it’s Taylor Swift, I was nervous - and she was really supportive and friendly, she knew the crew’s names - which sounds like such a silly thing but it’s not something that happens all the time, and it is a really important thing. She was just such a light to be around, and I imagine still is, we haven’t spoken in a while, but it was just such an amazing experience and she’s such an inspirationally amazing young woman that I can only wish her the best and thank her for steering my career in the right direction. [About Style music video] Kyle Newman was the director, and the concept of mirrors and reflections and projection and stuff like that was not only sort of his brainchild, but he actually did it all. The only thing that was green-screened was the mirror in front of our faces that had each others faces in them, but everything else - the projection, all of that - that was all physically done on set. It was absolutely incredible.” ",

      "Transcript/Content": "How Aaron Dessner and Taylor Swift Stripped Down Her Sound on ‘Folklore’\nThe National musician discusses charting new musical ground with the pop star as she embraces the stories and mythos of the American folk tradition\n\nBY JON BLISTEIN JULY 24, 2020\n\nThe National's Aaron Dessner on his unlikely collaboration with Taylor Swift and how the pop star charted new musical ground on 'Folklore.' \n\nAT THE BEGINNING of March, the National’s Aaron Dessner traveled back to the United States from Paris, where he’d been living with his family, to shack up at Sonic Ranch Studio in Tornillo, Texas to work on the next Big Red Machine album with Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon. Those plans — obviously — soon shifted, as the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic set in. Dessner and his family were able to relocate to their home in upstate New York as lockdown orders went into effect, and the musician soon settled into a groove of homeschooling his kids and focusing fully on music in a way he hadn’t in a while, due to the National’s regularly rigorous touring schedule. \n\nIn the middle of what Dessner describes as one of the most productive moments of his career, Taylor Swift called. \n\nA longtime and avowed fan of the National, Swift asked if Dessner wanted to try collaborating on a few songs remotely. He said of course, and asked if she was looking for anything in particular. He noted that he had plenty of material at the ready, but acknowledged he’d been in a more experimental mood, due to the Big Red Machine sessions; not to mention, Dessner added, he’d never really ventured into the pop world Swift has dominated for well over a decade. She told him to send everything he had. \n\n“I think she was interested in the emotions that she feels in some of the music that I’ve made,” Dessner tells Rolling Stone.” So I just sent her a folder of things I’d done recently and was excited about. Hours after, she sent back a fully written version of ‘Cardigan.’ It was like a lightning bolt struck the house.” \n\nOver the next few months, Dessner and Swift crafted the bulk of Swift’s eighth studio album, Folklore, which was released today, July 24th, after being announced the day before. Folklore is yet another mesmerizing musical move from Swift — a shift towards a broad indie-folk sound (à la, of course, the National) that still feels distinctly Swift-ian, as if she’s been making music like this her whole career. Lyrically, too, the record finds Swift playing with character and myth in new ways that — befitting the album’s title — recall the great American folk tradition. \n\nDessner wasn’t the album’s only collaborator; Swift wrote several songs with regular producer Jack Antonoff, as well as songwriter named William Bowery, who doesn’t seem to have much of an internet footprint. Vernon also contributed to two songs, singing on one of the album’s many stunners, “Exile,” while Dessner’s brother and National bandmate, Bryce Dessner, helped orchestrate it with a mix of musicians scattered around the globe (none of whom even knew what they were playing on when they recorded their parts).\n\nDessner spoke with Rolling Stone about working with Swift, their instant chemistry, how the album developed under a thick cloud of secrecy and more.\n\nWhen Taylor first reached out, did she have a specific vision in mind for the album?\nShe was a bit cryptic. I didn’t know that we were actually working on a record for quite a while. It just seemed that she was seeking me out to collaborate. And then we were both feeling very inspired by it. Once there were six or seven songs that we had written over a couple of weeks, she said, “Hey can we talk?” Then she said, ‘This is what I’m imagining,’ and started to tell me about the concept of Folklore. Then she mentioned that she’d written some songs at an earlier stage with Jack [Antonoff], and they felt like they really fit together with what we were doing. It was a very inspiring, exhilarating collaborative process that was almost entirely remote. Very sort of warp speed, but also something about it felt like we were going toe-to-toe and in a good pocket. \n\nAfter “Cardigan,” how did these songs develop and do you think she pushed you in any new directions as a songwriter?\nWhen you’re working with someone new, it takes a second to understand their instincts and range. It’s not really conscious. She wrote “Cardigan,” and then “Seven,” then “Peace.” They kind of set a road map, because “Cardigan” was this kind of experimental ballad, the closest thing to a pop song on the record, but it’s not really. It’s this emotional thing, but it has some strange sounds in it. “Seven” is this kind of nostalgic, emotional folk song. Even before she sang to it, I felt this nostalgia, wistful feeling in it, and I think that’s what she gravitated towards. And “Peace,” that just showed me the incredible versatility that she had. That song is just three harmonized bass lines and a pulse. I love to play bass like that — play one line then harmonize another, and another, which is a behavior I stole from Justin Vernon, because he’s done that on other things we’ve done together. And actually, that’s his pulse, he sent me that pulse and said, “Do something with this.” But when she wrote that song, which kind of reminds me of a Joni Mitchell song over a harmonized bassline and a pulse, that was kind of like, “Woah, anything can happen here.” That’s not easy to do.\n\nSo, in the morning I would wake up and try to be productive. “Mad Woman” is one I wrote shortly after that, in terms of sound world, felt very related to “Cardigan” and “Seven.” I do have a way of playing piano where it’s very melodic and emotional, but then often it’s great if whoever’s singing doesn’t sing exactly what’s in the piano melody, but maybe it’s connected in some way. There was just some chemistry happening with her and how she was relating to those ideas. \n\n“Epiphany” was something she had an idea for, and then I imagined these glacial, Icelandic sounds with distended chords and this almost classical feeling. That was another one where we wrote it and conceived it together. She just has a very instinctive and sharp musical mind, and she was able to compose so closely to what I was presenting. What I was doing was clicking for her. It was exhilarating for us, and it was surreal — we were shocked by it, to be honest [Laughs]. I think the warmth, humanity and raw energy of her vocals, and her writing on this record, from the very first voice memos — it was all there. \n\nDo you think that chemistry might’ve had something to do with her being a National fan, and you being a fan of her music?\nWe met Taylor at Saturday Night Live in 2014, or whenever that was that we played and Lena Dunham was hosting. We got to meet her, and that was our first brush with a bona fide pop star. But then she came to see us play in Brooklyn last summer and was there in a crazy rainstorm, like torrential downpour, and watched the whole show and stayed for a long time afterwards, talking to me and my brother. She was incredibly charming and humble. That’s the nice thing about her, and a lot of people I’ve met that have that kind of celebrity. It’s great when you can just tune it out and be normal people and chat, and that’s how that felt. So, we knew that she was a big fan, and we really got into the 1989 album. Our Icelandic collaborator, Ragnar Kjartansson, is a crazy Swiftie. So we’ve kind of lived vicariously through him. I’ve always been astonished by how masterful she is in her craft. I’ve always listened to her albums and put them in this rarefied category, like, “How did she do that? How does anybody do that? How do you make ‘Blank Space?’” There was an element that was intimidating at first, where it just took me a second to be like… Not because I think her music is better than what we’ve done, but it’s just a different world. \n\nWere there particular songs, albums or artists the two of you discussed as reference points for this album?\n“Betty,” which is a song she wrote with William Bowery, she was interested in sort of early Bob Dylan, like Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan, I think. “Epiphany,” early on, felt like some weird Kate Bush-meets-Peter Gabriel thing. I think we talked a little about those things, but not a lot. Actually, I think she really trusted me as far as my instincts to where the music would ultimately go, and also the mixing process.  We really wanted to keep her voice as human, and kind of the opposite of plastic, as possible. That was a bit of a battle. Because everything in pop music tends to be very carved out, a smiley face, and as pushed as possible so that it translates to the radio or wherever you hear it. That can also happen with a National song — like if you changed how these things are mixed, they wouldn’t feel like the same song. And she was really trusting and heard it herself. She would make those calls herself, also. \n\nYou mentioned William Bowery — who is he?\nHe’s a songwriter, and actually because of social distancing, I’ve never met him. He actually wrote the original idea for “Exile,” and then Taylor took it and ran with it. I don’t actually know to be totally honest. \n\nWe’ve been trying to track him down, he doesn’t have much of an internet presence.\nYeah, I don’t fully know him, other than he wrote “Betty” and “Exile” with her. But you know she’s a very collaborative person, so it was probably some songwriter. \n\nSo it’s not an alias for anyone?\nNo, no, no. I mean, I don’t know — she didn’t tell me there was a “Cardigan” video until literally it came out, and I wrote the song with her [laughs]. So I don’t know. But I’m pretty sure he’s an actual songwriter. She enjoys little mysteries. \n\n“These are kind of these folkloric, almost mythical tales that are woven in of childhood, lost love, and different sentiments across the record.”\n\nWith the National, you and your brother write the music, Matt Berninger adds the lyrics, and then you fuse it — was it a similar process on Folklore?\nTaylor is very collaborative in that sense that, whenever she sent a voice memo, she would send all the lyrics and then ask me what I thought. And sometimes we would debate certain lines, although generally she’s obviously a strong writer. So she would ask me if I liked one line, and she would give me alternate lines and I would give her my opinion. And then when she was actually tracking vocals, I would sometimes suggest things or miss things, but she definitely has a lot of respect for the collaborative process and wants whoever she’s writing with to feel deeply included in that process. It was nice, and was a back and forth, for sure. And she would sometimes have ideas about the production if she didn’t like something, especially. She would, in a tactful way, bring that up. I appreciated that, too, since I wanted to try to turn over every leaf, take risks and sometimes get it wrong. That always takes a second, to get over and then you start again. \n\nYou mentioned earlier that once you had six, seven songs, she was able to describe a concept behind the album. I’m curious what that conversation was like.\nShe would always explain what each song was about to me, even before she articulated the Folklore concept. And I could tell early on that they were these narrative songs, often told from a different… not in the first person. So there are different characters in the songs that appear in others. You may have a character in “Betty” that’s also related to one in “Cardigan,” for example. And I think that was, in her mind, very, very important. It doesn’t seem like, for this record at least, that she was inspired to write something until she really knew what it was about. And I think I’m used to a more — at least lately — impressionistic and experimental world of making stuff without really knowing what it is. But this was more direct, in that sense. That was really helpful, to know what it was about and it would guide some of the choices we were making. \n\nEvery time she would send something, she would narrate a little bit, like how it fit, or what it was about. And then when she told me about Folklore as a concept, it made so much sense. Like “The Last Great American Dynasty,” for example, this kind of narrative song that then becomes personal at the end — it flips and she enters the song. These are kind of these folkloric, almost mythical tales that are woven in of childhood, lost love, and different sentiments across the record. It was binding it all together and I think it’s personal, but also through the guise of other people, friends and loved ones.\n\nYou were working in secret — how did that affect the process? Was that a difficult burden?\nIt was. I was humbled and honored and grateful for the opportunity and for the crazy sort of alchemy we were having. But it was hard not to be able to talk openly with my usual collaborators, even my brother at first. I didn’t know if I could really tell him, because we normally… Ultimately, he helped me quite a bit, he orchestrated songs. But we always help each other. But eventually, we figured out how to do it. Towards the end of the process, I said to Taylor, ‘I really feel that I need to try a few experiment and try to elevate a few moments on the record because we have time, and we’ve really done a ton of work here, and it all sounds great, but I think we can go even further.’ And then she said, ‘Well what does that mean?’ And I explained how that would work, and the way that we work. Our process is very community-oriented, and we have long-time collaborators that we have a good understanding with. So I was able to say, to my friends, ‘This is a song I’m working on, I can’t send it to you with the vocals, and I can’t tell you what it is, but I can explain what I’m imagining.’ And the same with my brother, he knows my music so well that that was very easy for him to just take things that we were working on, add to that, and do his kind of work. So it was all remote and everyone was in their corner and we were shipping things around. It was incredibly fast because of that, because you didn’t have eight people needing to come to the studio. You had eight people working simultaneously — one in France and one in L.A. and one in Brooklyn. This is how it went, and it was fun. We got there. \n\nWhen were you able to tell everyone who contributed that this was the Taylor Swift record, what was their reaction?\nYou can imagine. I think they realized it was something big because [of] the confidentiality, and they were like, ‘It could only be a few things.’ I couldn’t tell them until, basically, when she announced it. Just in the moments after she announced it, I basically told everyone. I was like, ‘By the way…’ And they were thrilled. Everyone’s thrilled. Nobody seemed mad, everyone was thrilled and honored. Even Justin Vernon had not heard anything else except “Exile,” even though the pulse of that song “Peace,” he gave that song to me. It was important to have it be a surprise, and you know how it can be with someone in her position, with all the speculation, and she’s always under a lot of pressure like that. So it was really important to the creative freedom she was feeling that this remained a secret, so she could just do what we were doing. \n\n\nBeing such longtime friends and collaborators with Justin, what was it like hearing “Exile” for the first time? His voice and Taylor’s together?\nHe’s so versatile and has such a crazy range, and puts so much emotion… Every time he sings when I’m in his presence, my head just kind of hits the back of the wall. That’s the same on this song. William Bowery and Taylor wrote that song together, got it to a certain point, then I sort of interpreted it and developed a recording of it, and then Taylor tracked both the male and female parts. And then we sent it to Justin and he re-did obviously the male parts and changed a few things and also added his own: He wrote the “step right out” part of the bridge, and Taylor re-sang to that. You feel like, in a weird way, you’re watching two of the greatest songwriters and vocalists of our generation collaborating. I was facilitating it and making it happen, and playing all the music. But it was definitely a “Wow.” I was just a fan at that point, seeing it happen. \n\nAre there any moments that really stick out to you as particularly pivotal in shaping the sound of this record?\nThe initial response. When we first connected, and I sent a folder of music and Taylor wrote “Cardigan,” and she said, “This is abnormal. Why do you have all these songs that are so emotional and so moving to me? This feels fated.” And then she just dove into it and embraced this emotional current. And I hope that’s what people take out of it: The humanity in her writing and melodies. It’s a different side to her. She could have been every bit as successful just making these kinds of songs, but it’s so great that she’s also made everything that she’s ever made, and this is a really interesting shift, and an emotional one. It also opens other doors, because now it’s kind of like she can go wherever she wants, creatively. The pressure to make a certain kind of… bop — or whatever you want to call it — is not there really anymore. And I think that’s really liberating, and I hope her fans and the world are excited by that because I am. It’s really special. ",

      "Transcript/Content": "The National’s Aaron Dessner Talks Taylor Swift’s New Album folklore\nIn an interview with Pitchfork, the producer and multi-instrumentalist tells the story of how his surprising creative partnership with Swift came to be\nBy Sam Sodomsky July 24, 2020\n\nLike millions of people across the world, Taylor Swift spent the past few months in isolation, stuck at home, changing plans, reflecting on the past, and imagining new connections. One of those new connections was with Aaron Dessner, the multi-instrumentalist and producer from the National. Their creative partnership resulted in 11 of the 16 songs on Swift’s brand new album folklore, which was released today.\n\nDessner’s production credits range from Michael Stipe and Sharon Van Etten to 2016’s star-studded Grateful Dead tribute box Day of the Dead, but this marks his highest-profile work yet. On release day, he called us from his home in the Hudson Valley to speak about their entirely virtual but highly collaborative process, sounding just as surprised as anyone. “Nobody needs to tell Taylor Swift how to write a song—and I certainly didn’t,” he says with a laugh. “But it did feel like we were going toe-to-toe pushing each other.”\n\nWhat is your personal relationship with Taylor Swift’s music?\n\nI’ve always admired her craftsmanship and talent. But 1989 was the first one I was really listening to as a fan. My brother [Bryce Dessner, guitarist in the National] and I were in Iceland with [performance artist] Ragnar Kjartansson, and he’s a total Swiftie. It was the summer of 1989, and we’d be hanging out listening to it loud. Ragnar is an art historian, so he was just contextualizing every moment. It was a lot of fun. That’s when we became bigger fans.\n\nWhen did you actually meet her for the first time?\n\nWe met her at Saturday Night Live in 2014 when Lena Dunham was hosting. And then she came to see us play last summer in Prospect Park during this crazy torrential downpour. She was there with Antoni [Porowski] from Queer Eye. She talked a lot with my brother and me. That’s when we realized how much of a fan she was, and how lovely and down to earth. I don’t know that many people who have that sort of success, so it’s a nice feeling to realize they’re cool. That left a good impression.\n\nShe got in touch again at the end of April. I got a text and it said, “Hey, it’s Taylor. Would you ever be up for writing songs with me?” I said, “Wow. Of course.” It was a product of this time. Everything we had planned got cancelled. Everything she had planned got cancelled. It was a time when the ideas in the back of your head came to the front. That’s how it started.\n\nWATCH\n\n\nThe One Song Jay Som Wishes She Wrote\n\nYou ended up with a credit on 11 of the 16 songs. How did the collaboration get going?\n\nAt the very beginning of March, Justin Vernon and I had gone to Texas to work on the new Big Red Machine album. I had been living with my family in France as COVID was starting to spiral out of control in Europe. I said to my wife that maybe they should come back to the States with me because I was worried about getting separated. So we got tickets, and my kids and wife flew to [the family’s home in] Upstate New York and I flew to Texas. I was there for a week, and by the time I got back Upstate, the borders were being shut and we got stuck. I have the Long Pond studio here, so in a way it was lucky.\n\nI hunkered down here and started to write a ton of music—more than I ever have. I thought maybe they were National or Big Red Machine ideas or maybe something totally different. Things were happening.\n\nSo when [Taylor] reached out, I had this large folder of ideas that were pretty well on their way. She was very clear that she didn’t want me to edit any of my ideas; she wanted to hear everything that was interesting to me at this moment, including really odd, experimental noise. So I made a folder of stuff, including some pretty out-there sketches. A few hours later, she sent “cardigan,” fully written in a voice memo. That’s when I realized that this was unusual—just the focus and clarity of her ideas. It was pretty astonishing. Over the next couple months, this would just happen; all of a sudden, I’d get a voice memo. And then another. Eventually, it was so inspiring that I wrote more ideas that were specifically in response to what she was writing.\n\nWhen did it occur to you that an album was forming?\n\nThere were moments when we started to reflect on what we were doing. The first three songs we wrote were “cardigan,” “seven,” and “peace.” “cardigan” is probably the closest to a pop song on the record—it’s this epic narrative. And then “seven” was this nostalgic, wistful, emotional folk song. And then when she wrote “peace,” I realized she can do anything! She is so versatile. It’s just a harmonized bassline with a pulse and a drone, and she basically wrote a Joni Mitchell love song to it. She only did one vocal take, and that’s what’s on the record.\n\nMOST POPULAR\nCardi B Joins Glorilla and Megan Thee Stallion for New “Wanna Be (Remix)”\nNEWS\nCardi B Joins Glorilla and Megan Thee Stallion for New “Wanna Be (Remix)”\nBy Matthew Strauss\n\nJennifer Lopez Cancels Tour Less Than One Month Before Kickoff\nNEWS\nJennifer Lopez Cancels Tour Less Than One Month Before Kickoff\nBy Matthew Strauss\n\nEminem Throws Back to His Most Iconic Moments in Video for New Song “Houdini”\nNEWS\nEminem Throws Back to His Most Iconic Moments in Video for New Song “Houdini”\nBy Matthew Strauss\n\nWere you communicating through the whole process?\n\nYeah. We were pretty much in touch daily for three or four months by text and phone calls. Some of it was about production and restructuring things but a lot of it was just excitement. We both felt that this was some of the best work we have done. That was a strange and surreal thing to have happen, especially at this time.\n\nAt one point I was randomly doxxed by right-wing conspiracy theorists who misidentified me as an Antifa organizer in Ohio, long story, but it was in the middle of all this work. I didn’t want to stress her out so I didn’t tell her. But at some point she laughed and said, “So you’re a notorious anarchist?” And I’m like, “Yeah, I was gonna mention that.”\n\nHow did the collaboration with Bon Iver on “exile” come about?\n\nTaylor wrote that one with the singer-songwriter William Bowery. When Taylor sent it to me as a voice memo, she sang both the male and female parts—as much as she could fit in without losing her breath. We talked about who she was imagining joining her, and she loves Justin [Vernon]’s voice in Bon Iver and Big Red Machine. She was like, “Oh my God, I would die if he would do it. It would be so perfect.” I didn’t want to put pressure on Justin as his friend, so I said, “Well, it depends on if he’s inspired by the song but I know he thinks you’re rad.” Which he does.\n\nSo I sent him the song and he was really into it. He tweaked some parts and added parts as well—the bridge where he says, “Step right out.” The end, too, and his choral parts. It was fun because Justin and I work on a lot of stuff together, so it was very easy and natural. At some point I felt like a superfan, hearing two of my favorite singers. This was all being done remotely, but it was one of those moments where your head hits the back of the wall and you’re like, “Fuck. OK.”\n\nThere is some fan debate over William Bowery’s identity—I’m not familiar with him.\n\nI’m not either. I haven’t actually met him because of social distancing, which is kind of funny. I think he’s a friend.\n\nDid you feel the pressure of working with an artist at Taylor Swift’s level?\n\nI tried hard not to think about the scope or scale of making a record that would be heard by millions and millions of people. I did a pretty good job of tuning that out. Music for me is an emotional necessity. It’s therapy. It’s what I live and breathe. All these songs are things I was working on already, and we both felt there was some serendipity in the fact that we ended up in this situation together. I just stayed focused on that, on making this as good as we can.\n\nMOST POPULAR\nCardi B Joins Glorilla and Megan Thee Stallion for New “Wanna Be (Remix)”\nNEWS\nCardi B Joins Glorilla and Megan Thee Stallion for New “Wanna Be (Remix)”\nBy Matthew Strauss\n\nJennifer Lopez Cancels Tour Less Than One Month Before Kickoff\nNEWS\nJennifer Lopez Cancels Tour Less Than One Month Before Kickoff\nBy Matthew Strauss\n\nEminem Throws Back to His Most Iconic Moments in Video for New Song “Houdini”\nNEWS\nEminem Throws Back to His Most Iconic Moments in Video for New Song “Houdini”\nBy Matthew Strauss\n\nAs the release got closer, I almost thought it wouldn’t happen. Or maybe I just told myself that! The National guys will tell you the same thing—I tend to work until the last possible minute. I didn’t really have a moment to be like, “Holy shit! People are gonna hear this.” We were joking about it last night. I said, “So this actually happened?” And she goes, “Yep!”\n\nWhat was it like working under total secrecy?\n\nThere was no outside influence at all. In fact, nobody knew, including her label, until hours before it was launched. For someone who’s been in this glaring spotlight for 15 years, it’s really liberating to have some privacy and work on her own terms. She deserves that. At times, if I wanted friends to play on the record, it was a little difficult because you can’t send a file with her vocals. But everyone was cool. At the end, I reached out to some wizards just to add bits, and that was nice. It was kind of fun: “What? Why can’t you tell me, Aaron?” Then they start guessing. Everyone made a game out of it.\n\nIs there any music that was left on the cutting room floor?\n\nThere are things I feel could still be songs. It does feel like an ongoing collaboration. Now Taylor is starting to help with other things. We’re bouncing other ideas off each other, whether it’s Big Red Machine or other things. There’s a community aspect. I think that’s how music should be.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Aaron Dessner confirms: folklore is Taylor Swift’s goth record. Or, at least, it’s her most gothic record. It’s also a few other things, depending on your mood: an unofficial Big Red Machine collaboration (Big RED Machine); a spiritual companion to The National’s 2019 album I Am Easy To Find, specifically its accompanying Mike Mills film, also shot in black-and-white and emphasizing a more natural setting; or just Swift’s attempt at a headphone record, one that, even if you don’t buy into the Taylor Swift mythology, rewards multiple listens as you pick up on all the intricacies of each song and realize wow, this is where the In Rainbows influence comes in. Dessner is the one to thank for all these little details.\n\nThe National multi-instrumentalist spoke to Vulture over the phone from upstate New York a few hours after the surprise release of Swift’s eighth studio album. (“A pretty wild ride,” he admits, sounding tired yet happy.) He was clear that he can’t speak on behalf of Swift’s lyrics, much like he can’t for The National frontman Matt Berninger’s either, or the thinking behind Jack Antonoff’s songs. (Here’s a cheat sheet: Jack’s songs soar, Aaron’s glide.) But Dessner was game to speak to his specific contributions, influences, and own interpretations of each song on folklore, a record you can sum up by two words that came up often during our conversation: nostalgic and wry.\n\n“THE 1”\n\n“the 1” and “hoax,” the first song and the last song, were the last songs we did. The album was sort of finished before that. We thought it was complete, but Taylor then went back into the folder of ideas that I had shared. I think in a way, she didn’t realize she was writing for this album or a future something. She wrote “the 1,” and then she wrote “hoax” a couple of hours later and sent them in the middle of the night. When I woke up in the morning, I wrote her before she woke up in LA and said, “These have to be on the record.” She woke up and said, “I agree” [laughs]. These are the bookends, you know?\n\nIt’s clear that “the 1” is not written from her perspective. It’s written from another friend’s perspective. There’s an emotional wryness and rawness,while also tothis kind of wink in her eyes. There’s a little bit of her sense of humor in there, in addition to this kind of sadness that exists both underneath and on the surface. I enjoy that about her writing.\n\nThe song [began from] the voice memo she sent me, and then I worked on the music some and we tracked her vocals, and then my brother added orchestration. There are a few other little bits, but basically that was one of the very last things we did.\n\n“CARDIGAN”\n\nThat’s the first song we wrote [in early May]. After Taylor asked if I would be interested in writing with her remotely and working on songs, I said, “Are you interested in a certain kind of sound?” She said, “I’m just interested in what you do and what you’re up to. Just send anything, literally anything, it could be the weirdest thing you’ve ever done,” so I sent a folder of stuff I had done that I was really excited about recently. “cardigan” was one of those sketches; it was originally called “Maple.” It was basically exactly what it is on the record, except we added orchestration later that my brother wrote.\n\nI sent [the file] at 9 p.m., and around 2 a.m. or something, there was “cardigan,” fully written. That’s when I realized something crazy was happening. She just dialed directly into the heart of the music and wrote an incredible song and fully conceived of it and then kept going.\nIt harkens back to lessons learned, or experiences in your youth, in a really beautiful way and this sense of longing and sadness, but ultimately, it’s cathartic. I thought it was a perfect match for the music, and how her voice feels. It was kind of a guide. It had these lower register parts, and I think we both realized that this was a bit of a lightning rod for a lot of the rest of the record.\n\n“THE LAST GREAT AMERICAN DYNASTY”\n\nI wrote that after we’d been working for a while. It was an attempt to write something attractive, more uptempo and kind of pushing. I also was interested in this almost In Rainbows-style latticework of electric guitars. They come in and sort of pull you along, kind of reminiscent of Big Red Machine. It was very much in this sound world that I’ve been playing around with, and she immediately clicked with that. Initially I was imagining these dreamlike distant electric guitars and electronics but with an element of folk. There’s a lot going on in that sense. I sent it before I went on a run, and when I got back from the run, that song was there [laughs].\n\nShe told me the story behind it, which sort of recounts the narrative of Rebekah Harkness, whom people actually called Betty. She was married to the heir of Standard Oil fortune, married into the Harkness family, and they bought this house in Rhode Island up on a cliff. It’s kind of the story of this woman and the outrageous parties she threw. She was infamous for not fitting in, entirely, in society; that story, at the end, becomes personal. Eventually, Taylor bought that house. I think that is symptomatic of folklore, this type of narrative song. We didn’t do very much to that either.\n\n“EXILE” (FT. BON IVER)\n\nTaylor and William Bowery, the singer-songwriter, wrote that song initially together and sent it to me as a sort of a rough demo where Taylor was singing both the male and female parts. It’s supposed to be a dialogue between two lovers. I interpreted that and built the song, played the piano, and built around that template. We recorded Taylor’s vocals with her singing her parts but also the male parts.\n\nWe talked a lot about who she thought would be perfect to sing, and we kept coming back to Justin [Vernon]. Obviously, he’s a dear friend of mine and collaborator. I said, “Well, if he’s inspired by the song, he’ll do it, and if not, he won’t.” I sent it to him and said, “No pressure at all, literally no pressure, but how do you feel about this?” He said, “Wow.” He wrote some parts into it also, and we went back and forth a little bit, but it felt like an incredibly natural and safe collaboration between friends. It didn’t feel like getting a guest star or whatever. It was just like, well, we’re working on something, and obviously he’s crazy talented, but it just felt right. I think they both put so much raw emotion into it. It’s like a surface bubbling. It’s believable, you know? You believe that they’re having this intense dialogue.\n\nWith other people I had to be secretive, but with Justin, because he was going to sing, I actually did send him a version of the song with her vocals and told him what I was up to. He was like, “Whoa! Awesome!” But he’s been involved in so many big collaborative things that he wasn’t interested in it from that point of view. It’s more because he loved the song and he thought he could do something with it that would add something.\n\n“MY TEARS RICOCHET”\n\nThis is one of my absolute favorite songs on the record. I think it’s a brilliant composition, and Taylor’s words, the way her voice sounds and how this song feels, are, to me, one of the critical pieces. It’s lodged in my brain. That’s also very important to Taylor and Jack. It’s like a beacon for this record.\n\n“MIRRORBALL”\n\n“mirrorball” is, to me, a hazy sort of beautiful. It almost reminds me of ‘90s-era Cardigans, or something like Mazzy Star. It has this kind of glow and haze. It feels really good before “seven,” which becomes very wistful and nostalgic. There are just such iconic images in the lyrics [“Spinning in my highest heels”], which aren’t coming to me at the moment because my brain is not working [laughs].\n\n“SEVEN”\n\nThis is the second song we wrote. It’s kind of looking back at childhood and those childhood feelings, recounting memories and memorializing them. It’s this beautiful folk song. It has one of the most important lines on the record: “And just like a folk song, our love will be passed on.” That’s what this album is doing. It’s passing down. It’s memorializing love, childhood, and memories. It’s a folkloric way of processing.\n\n“AUGUST”\n\nThis is maybe the closest thing to a pop song. It gets loud. It has this shimmering summer haze to it. It’s kind of like coming out of “seven” where you have this image of her in the swing and she’s seven years old, and then in “august” I think it feels like fast-forwarding to now. That’s an interesting contrast. I think it’s just a breezy, sort of intoxicating feeling.\n\n“THIS IS ME TRYING”\n\n“this is me trying,” to me, relates to the entire album. Maybe I’m reading into it too much from my own perspective, but[I think of] the whole album as an exercise and working through these stories, whether personal or old through someone else’s perspective. It’s connecting a lot of things. But I love the feeling in it and the production that Jack did. It has this lazy swagger.\n\n“ILLICIT AFFAIRS”\n\nThis feels like one of the real folk songs on the record, a sharp-witted narrative folk song. It just shows her versatility and her power as a songwriter, the sharpness of her writing. It’s a great song.\n\n“INVISIBLE STRING”\n\nThat was another one where it was music that I’d been playing for a couple of months and sort of humming along to her. It felt like one of the songs that pulls you along. Just playing it on one guitar, it has this emotional locomotion in it, a meditative finger-picking pattern that I really gravitate to. It’s played on this rubber bridge that my friend put on [the guitar] and it deadens the strings so that it sounds old. The core of it sounds like a folk song.\n\nIt’s also kind of a sneaky pop song, because of the beat that comes in. She knew that there was something coming because she said, “You know, I love this and I’m hearing something already.” And then she said, “This will change the story,” this beautiful and direct kind of recounting of a relationship in its origin.\n\n“MAD WOMAN”\n\nThat might be the most scathing song on folklore. It has a darkness that I think is cathartic, sort of witch-hunting and gaslighting and maybe bullying. Sometimes you become the person people try to pin you into a corner to be, which is not really fair. But again, don’t quote me on that [laughs], I just have my own interpretation. It’s one of the biggest releases on the album to me. It has this very sharp tone to it, but sort of in gothic folklore. It’s this record’s goth song.\n\n“EPIPHANY”\n\nFor “epiphany,” she did have this idea of a beautiful drone, or a very cinematic sort of widescreen song, where it’s not a lot of accents but more like a sea to bathe in. A stillness, in a sense. I first made this crazy drone which starts the song, and it’s there the whole time. It’s lots of different instruments played and then slowed down and reversed. It created this giant stack of harmony, which is so giant that it was kind of hard to manage, sonically, but it was very beautiful to get lost in. And then I played the piano to it, and it almost felt classical or something, those suspended chords.\n\nI think she just heard it, and instantly, this song came to her, which is really an important one. It’s partially the story of her grandfather, who was a soldier, and partially then a story about a nurse in modern times. I don’t know if this is how she did it, but to me, it’s like a nurse, doctor, or medical professional, where med school doesn’t fully prepare you for seeing someone pass away or just the difficult emotional things that you’ll encounter in your job. In the past, heroes were just soldiers. Now they’re also medical professionals. To me, that’s the underlying mission of the song. There are some things that you see that are hard to talk about. You can’t talk about it. You just bear witness to them. But there’s something else incredibly soothing and comforting about this song. To me, it’s this Icelandic kind of feel, almost classical. My brother did really beautiful orchestration of it.\n\n“BETTY”\n\nThis one Taylor and William wrote, and then both Jack and I worked on it. We all kind of passed it around. This is the one where Taylor wanted a reference. She wanted it to have an early Bob Dylan, sort of a Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan feel. We pushed it a little more towards John Wesley Harding, since it has some drums. It’s this epic narrative folk song where it tells us a long story and connects back to “cardigan.” It starts to connect dots and I think it’s a beautifully written folk song.\n\n“PEACE”\n\nI wrote this, and Justin provided the pulse. We trade ideas all the time and he made a folder, and there was a pulse in there that I wrote these basslines to. In the other parts of the composition, I did it to Justin’s pulse. Taylor heard this sketch and she wrote the song. It reminds me of Joni Mitchell, in a way — there’s this really powerful and emotional love song, even the impressionistic, almost jazz-like bridge, and she weaves it perfectly together. This is one of my favorites, for sure. But the truth is that the music, that way of playing with harmonized basslines, is something that probably comes a little bit from me being inspired by how Justin does that sometimes. There’s probably a connection there. We didn’t talk too much about it [laughs].\n\n“HOAX”\n\nThis is a big departure. I think she said to me, “Don’t try to give it any other space other than what feels natural to you.” If you leave me in a room with a piano, I might play something like this. I take a lot of comfort in this. I think I imagined her playing this and singing it. After writing all these songs, this one felt the most emotional and, in a way, the rawest. It is one of my favorites. There’s sadness, but it’s a kind of hopeful sadness. It’s a recognition that you take on the burden of your partners, your loved ones, and their ups and downs. That’s both “peace” and “hoax” to me. That’s part of how I feel about those songs because I think that’s life. There’s a reality, the gravity or an understanding of the human condition.\n\n“THE LAKES”\nThat’s a Jack song. It’s a beautiful kind of garden, or like you’re lost in a beautiful garden. There’s a kind of Greek poetry to it. Tragic poetry, I guess.\n\nFOLKLORE FAQ\n1. WHAT’S THE MEANING OF THE ALBUM?\nWe didn’t talk about it at first. It was only after writing six or seven songs, basically when I thought my writing was done, when we got on the phone and said, “OK, I think we’re making an album. I have these six other ideas that I love with Jack [Antonoff] that we’ve already done, and I think what we’ve done fits really well with them.” It’s sort of these narratives, these folkloric songs, with characters that interweave and are written from different perspectives. She had a vision, and it was connecting back in some way to the folk tradition, but obviously not entirely sonically. It’s more about the narrative aspect of it.\n\nI think it’s this sort of nostalgia and wistfulness that is in a lot of the songs. A lot of them have this kind of longing for looking back on things that have happened in your life, in your friend’s life, or another loved one’s life, and the kind of storytelling around that. That was clear to her. But then we kept going, and more and more songs happened.\n\nIt was a very organic process where [meaning] wasn’t something that we really discussed. It just kind of would happen where she would dive back into the folder and find other things that were inspiring. Or she and William Bowery would write “exile,” and then that happened. There were different stages of the process.\n\nOkay, but is it A24-core?\n[Laughs.] Good comparison.\n\n2. HOW MUCH OF IT IS INFLUENCED BY THE NATIONAL?\nShe said that she’s a fan of the emotion that’s conveyed in our music. She doesn’t often get to work with music that is so raw and emotional, or melodic and emotional, at the same time. When I sent her the folder, that was one of the main feelings. She said, “What the fuck? How do you just have that?” [laughs] I was humbled and honored because she just said, “It’s a gift, and I want to write to all of this.” She didn’t write to all of it, but a lot of it, and relatively quickly.\n\nShe is a fan of the band, and she’s a fan of Big Red Machine. She’s well aware of the sentiment of it and what I do, but she didn’t ask for a certain kind of thing. I know that the film [I Am Easy To Find] has really affected her, and she’s very much in love with that film and the record. Maybe it’s subconsciously been an influence.\n\n3. HOW DO JACK ANTONOFF’S SONGS ON THE ALBUM DIFFER FROM DESSNER’S?\nI think we have different styles, and we weren’t making them together or in the same room. We both could probably come closer together in a sense that weirdly works. It’s like an archipelago, and each song is an island, but it’s all related. Taylor obviously binds it all together. And I think Jack, if he was working with orchestrations, there’s an emotional quality to his songs that’s clearly in the same world as mine.\n\nWe actually didn’t have a moodboard for the album at all. I don’t think that way. I don’t really know if she does either. I don’t think Jack … well, Jack might, but when I say the Cardigans or Mazzy Star, those aren’t Jack’s words about “mirrorball,” it’s just what calls to mind for me. Mainly she talked about emotion and to lean into it, the nostalgia and wistfulness, and the kind of raw, meditative emotion that I often kind of inhabit that I think felt very much where her heart was. We didn’t shy away from that.\n\n4. IS “BETTY” QUEER CANON?\nI can’t speak to what it’s about. I have my own ideas. I also know where Taylor’s heart is, and I think that’s great anytime a song takes on greater meaning for anyone.\n\n5. IS WILLIAM BOWERY SECRETLY JOE ALWYN?\nI don’t know. We’re close, but she won’t tell me that. I think it’s actually someone else, but it’s good to have some mysteries.\n\n6. DOES TAYLOR EXPLAIN HER LYRICS?\nShe would always talk about it. The narrative is essential, and kind of what it’s all about. We’d always talk about that upfront and saying that would guide me with the music. But again, she is operating at many levels where there are connections between all of these songs, or many of them are interrelated in the characters that reappear. There are threads. I think that sometimes she would point it out entirely, but I would start to see these patterns. It’s cool when you see someone’s mind working.",

      "Transcript/Content": "‘There Were Fireworks, Musically’: Aaron Dessner Opens Up About Making ‘Folklore’ With Taylor Swift\nThe surprise album revealed some of the pop star's best music yet — and makes The National’s Aaron Dessner a likely Grammy nominee.\n\nBy Lyndsey Havens / 09/17/2020\n\n“I just need to make a better record. I’m making a better record.” That’s what Taylor Swift said with striking calm in one of the most memorable clips from her Netflix documentary, Miss Americana, after finding out that her 2017 album, reputation, had been shut out of the 2018 Grammys’ Big Four categories.\n\nHer next release, Lover, didn’t quite live up to Swift’s ambitions, at least on the awards front: In 2019, its only major Grammy nod was for song of the year, for the title track. But now, thanks to her record-breaking, surprise (and surprising) pandemic release, folklore, she may have made a record that’s “better” in the eyes of voters. Swift’s only album to spend its first six weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, folklore pushes her songwriting into new territory, trading stadium-pop sheen for the subtle, layered production of prestige indie-rock, thanks in part to an unlikely collaborator: The National’s Aaron Dessner.\n\nDessner, 44, has been making music for over two decades, collaborating with everyone from close friends like Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon — with whom he co-founded the band Big Red Machine and more recently the independent label 37d03d, a partnership with Secretly Group — to Mumford & Sons and world-class orchestras. With nine co-writes and 11 production credits (some of which he shares with Jack Antonoff), folklore is Dessner’s most high-profile project yet and could well get him a producer of the year nomination. (He previously won a Grammy for best alternative music album with The National at the 2018 ceremony.)\n\n“Jack and I thought this would be a record we loved but had no expectations commercially,” says Dessner. “So the fact that it’s this weird smash — of course it would be amazing to win or be nominated. But it’s not on my list of things I feel that I need to accomplish in life. I really couldn’t be more proud of folklore. And also just like, ‘What the fuck, how did this happen?’”\n\nYou’ve said the best musical experiences you’ve had have come from moments of spontaneity. How does that apply to folklore?\n\nIt’s exactly that. I feel like I would not have been able to go toe-to-toe with Taylor in the way that I did if I hadn’t done everything else that I’d ever done. To me, making songs with your friends in some basement 20 years ago or producing records for totally unknown artists is just as important as when you end up, by some weird stroke of serendipity, in a crazy collaboration with someone who is so gifted. I had really run the gantlet of so many experiences that I was in a spot where when she came, there were fireworks, musically, between us. And we had the work ethic to see it through.\n\nOnce she reached out to you, how did you prepare to work with Swift?\n\nWell, I’ve definitely listened to all her records — I do that from time to time, just binge-listen to certain things — and I could tell she’s a savant. She’s such a performer, but so gifted as a writer. She told me upfront: “Don’t try to be anyone other than yourself,” because she was really gravitating toward the emotion in the music. She didn’t want me to try and be Max Martin or Jack Antonoff. I didn’t go obsess over “Shake It Off” or something. I had a lot of music that I’d been writing when she approached me, and I just sent a folder because she asked. Hours later, [she sent back] “Cardigan.” It was an unusual vein that we struck.\n\nWas there any material of your own that you didn’t want to offer up just yet?\n\nDefinitely. It was more that there were some songs that are specifically one thing or another. The Big Red Machine stuff is quite far along — and actually, Taylor has been amazing [at giving feedback]. I’ve shared all of that stuff with her, and she has been really helpful.\n\nDoes that mean we will we hear her on a Big Red Machine track in some form?\n\n[Laughs] I can’t really say, so I guess I’ll say neither yes nor no.\n\n\nHow does a massive pop star releasing what feels like an indie folk album allow other artists to feel less confined by genre?\n\nTaylor has opened the door for artists to not feel pressure to have “the bop.” To make the record that she made, while running against what is programmed in radio at the highest levels of pop music — she has kind of made an anti-pop record. And to have it be one of the most, if not the most, successful commercial releases of the year, that throws the playbook out. I hope it gives other artists, especially lesser-known or more independent artists, a chance at the mainstream. Maybe radio will realize that music doesn’t have to sound as pushed as it has. Nobody was trying to design anything to be a hit. Obviously Taylor has the privilege of already having a very large and dedicated audience, but I do feel like it’s having a resonance beyond that.\n\nMusic is already moving in that direction with artists like Billie Eilish. Why did that approach appeal to Swift?\n\nI think for people to hear what she’s capable of. That song “peace” — when she wrote that, it was just a harmonized bass and a pulse. She wrote this incredible love song to it that’s one vocal take. I definitely felt like I was exposed to a truly great artist in that moment, just to see her to carve into this sketch in a substantive way. Billie Eilish is a great point: There are people who are pushing the boundaries of what is and isn’t popular or mainstream music. To have been part of it and see it actually happen, I almost felt like, “Is it really going to come out? Is somebody going to come tell us that we’re ridiculous?”\n\n\nWas there any anxiety over fan and media reactions eclipsing the work itself?\n\nI had moments of self doubt, for sure, but I think that’s part of Taylor’s brilliance and kind-heartedness is to make me and others around her feel confident. She repeatedly would say, “There’s no hierarchy. This is as special and great as anything I’ve done before, if not greater, so don’t worry.” She has dealt with so much spotlight in her life, too much probably, so she knows better than anyone the kind of whims of the zeitgeist, so she was leading in that sense. We were on the phone when it came out, and it was a really special experience… We were just on the phone as people around the world were listening and reviews were coming in and the truth is, it went so well, that I have never thought about it again. It could have been the opposite.\n\nIn 2016, you and your brother Bryce, Justin Vernon and others launched a week-long Berlin residency called People that evolved into an online community for artists to self-publish work in real time. What’s the status of that platform now?\n\nAt some point People magazine told us that they own the word people in any media context, so we changed it to 37d03d, which is people upside down spelled with numbers and letters. We decided to start a proper record label in partnership with Secretly Group, and we put out as much music as we possibly can with the idea that — and this is very much a part of folklore — eventually there’s a large community of people feeding into the music and making it as great as it can be. [We’re] trying to create a label that really embraces that, and where decisions aren’t commercially driven. If somebody comes to us with this crazy noise record, we’re as interested in that as hit songs on some other record.\n\nYou and Swift made folklore without ever being in the same room. How do you see the pandemic changing the music industry?\n\nI do think the way that we’ve had to embrace collaborating remotely and being open to it is a powerful thing. Everything is on pause, and everyone is listening in a different way. I’d like to believe that this is a chance for some shifts to happen.\n\nA version of this article originally appeared in the Sept. 19, 2020, issue of Billboard.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Meet the photographer behind Taylor Swift's folklore artwork\nBeth Garrabrant talks us through her work – including the artwork for lockdown's biggest surprise album.\n\n|\nby Zoe Whitfield\n|\n24 September 2020, 9:00am\n\nBeth Garrabrant has been obsessed with making pictures since childhood. Back in high school, she landed her first gig photographing her science teacher’s kids. Before long she was cleaning the school’s darkroom in exchange for a little extra printing time.\n\nThis same devotion continued throughout college. But, graduating during a financial collapse meant forging a career as a photographer seemed near impossible, and instead she took work as a photo editor. “I wasn’t the most organised,” she says, “but I did meet photographers and friends who continue to inspire me, so I’m thankful for the detour.”\n\nAfter returning to the medium full-time, today Beth draws links between the work she makes and her formative years in and out of the high school dark room. Her pictures centre on America and the youth occupying it. Her subjects, often teens and tweens, play dress up in prom gowns, hang out in the lunch hall and eat snacks on the couch. It’s a world we’re familiar with, but Beth’s images display an affinity and respect that elevates the spaces she foregrounds beyond their conventional trappings in culture. As she tells it, she manages this by commemorating her own girlhood.\n\nBeth Garrabrant photography\nIt’s perhaps fitting then, that she grew up living on the same street as a formative director in capturing American adolescence. “John Hughes lived just down the road. The imaginary town of Shermer, IL, where most of his movies take place, is based on the suburbs where I grew up,” she says.\n\nIt’s a different icon of pop culture, however, with whom Beth will henceforth be bound to. Tapped by Taylor Swift to collaborate, she shot the artwork for quarantine’s most popular album, folklore.\n\n“A sweater-weather record released on a whim in the blue heat of this lonely summer,” according to Pitchfork, folklore was the surprise drop of the summer that no one, not even Taylor, saw coming. Announced via Instagram with Beth’s images posed in grid-formation, it spent five weeks at number one on the Billboard 100 and, almost two months on, fans continue to flood social media with their interpretations of the black-and-white pictures.\n\nBeth Garrabrant photography\nYour pictures seem to speak to your surroundings, but who are some of your photographic influences?\nTarrah Krajnak was a professor of mine at the University of Notre Dame [Indiana], and both her work and teachings were a great influence, particularly her use of alternative processes and exploration of personal history and archive. Other early influences include Esther Kroon, Emmet Gowin, and Rineke Dijkstra. As of late there are three Texan artists at the top of my list: Kennedi Carter, Rahim Fortune, and Adraint Bereal.\n\nYou grew up in Connecticut and Illinois. How have these places informed your work?\nIt’s a continuation of a series that I started in high school after a close friend passed away very unexpectedly. I’ve been staging, memorialising and archiving my girlhood experience. For now, I’ve moved away from the girl portraits and I’m focusing more on the setting of this experience. The town where we lived in Illinois was very insular. If I had to depict that place in one image I could easily use one of those pastel watercolor vignettes from the covers of The Baby-Sitters Club books. It was very traditional, very conservative, and very adverse to change: neon signs were not allowed and the town even tried to ban McDonalds in the 90s. In the TV show Eerie, Indiana there is an episode where you find out that the diabolical Stepford Wife next door is preserving her sons in Tupperware so that they remain teenagers forever. I’m fascinated by extreme preservation in suburbia.\n\nBeth Garrabrant photography\nYou live in Texas today. What inspired the move?\nI was on assignment photographing the Miss Rodeo Texas Pageant in San Antonio when the idea was born, though I’m not sure it would qualify as an idea. I love New York but I couldn’t save a dime and I missed having a car. I just happened to be going to Texas a lot for work one year so my husband and I thought, alright, Texas! Central Texas reminds me a lot of the Midwest, minus the cold.\n\nWhen did you learn you’d got the folklore gig?\nI was at my studio in Austin, when my phone rang. I work in an old 1940s house that was converted into artist studios, it sits on about seven acres of land, and I was taking a walk around the property with our neighbour's dog, Jolene, when I got the call. One week later I was in the woods with Taylor.\n\nBeth Garrabrant photography\nThis is your first album cover right? \nYes, this is the first album cover that I’ve worked on. I've photographed musicians before but I've never been part of the album process, and certainly couldn't have imagined the first to be of this magnitude.\n\nWhat were your references going into the project?\nFrom the very beginning Taylor had a clear idea of what she wanted for the album's visuals. We looked at Surrealist work, imagery that toyed with human scale in nature. We also looked at early autochromes, ambrotypes, and photo storybooks from the 1940s.\n\nBeth Garrabrant photography\nMuch of your published work is in colour, but you shot black-and-white for folklore_**. Can you speak on this?**\nI was thrilled when Taylor said that she envisioned the series in black-and-white and that she was keen on having everything shot on film. Since moving to Texas I've started shooting more black-and-white than colour. At first this was because I couldn't find a colour darkroom in Texas and I was anxious to print. There's a fantastic black-and-white darkroom in Austin that’s owned by a local artist; all of the _folklore film was hand developed in that little darkroom!\n\nThe record’s been out for several weeks now, only recently leaving the number one spot on the Billboard chart. What have been your personal highlights since the images were released?\nMy proud mom emailing me every time she saw folklore pictures online, in the newspaper, etc. But I also love seeing Taylor's fans recreate photos from the series.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift broke all her rules with Folklore—and gave herself a much-needed escape\nThe pop star, one of EW's 2020 Entertainers of the Year, delves deep into her surprise eighth album, Rebekah Harkness, and a Joe Biden presidency.\n\nBy Alex Suskind  Published on December 8, 2020 12:00PM EST\n\"He is my co-writer on 'Betty' and 'Exile,'\" replies Taylor Swift with deadpan precision. The question Who is William Bowery? was, at the time we spoke, one of 2020's great mysteries, right up there with the existence of Joe Exotic and the sudden arrival of murder hornets. An unknown writer credited on the year's biggest album? It must be an alias.\n\nIs he your brother?\n\n\"He's William Bowery,\" says Swift with a smile.\n\nIt's early November, after Election Day but before Swift eventually revealed Bowery's true identity to the world (the leading theory, that he was boyfriend Joe Alwyn, proved prescient). But, like all Swiftian riddles, it was fun to puzzle over for months, particularly in this hot mess of a year, when brief distractions are as comforting as a well-worn cardigan. Thankfully, the Bowery... erhm, Alwyn-assisted Folklore—a Swift project filled with muted pianos and whisper-quiet snares, recorded in secret with Jack Antonoff and the National's Aaron Dessner—delivered.\n\n\"The only people who knew were the people I was making it with, my boyfriend, my family, and a small management team,\" Swift, 30, tells EW of the album's hush-hush recording sessions. That gave the intimate Folklore a mystique all its own: the first surprise Taylor Swift album, one that prioritized fantastical tales over personal confessions.\n\n\"Early in quarantine, I started watching lots of films,\" she explains. \"Consuming other people's storytelling opened this portal in my imagination and made me feel like, Why have I never created characters and intersecting story lines?\" That's how she ended up with three songs about an imagined love triangle (\"Cardigan,\" \"Betty,\" \"August\"), one about a clandestine romance (\"Illicit Affairs\"), and another chronicling a doomed relationship (\"Exile\"). Others tell of sumptuous real-life figures like Rebekah Harkness, a divorcee who married the heir to Standard Oil—and whose home Swift purchased 31 years after her death. The result, \"The Last Great American Dynasty,\" hones in on Harkness' story, until Swift cleverly injects herself.\n\nAnd yet, it wouldn't be a Swift album without a few barbed postmortems over her own history. Notably, \"My Tears Ricochet\" and \"Mad Woman,\" which touch on her former label head Scott Borchetta selling the masters to Swift's catalog to her known nemesis Scooter Braun. Mere hours after our interview, the lyrics' real-life origins took a surprising twist, when news broke that Swift's music had once again been sold, to another private equity firm, for a reported $300 million. Though Swift ignored repeated requests for comment on the transaction, she did tweet a statement, hitting back at Braun while noting that she had begun re-recording her old albums—something she first promised in 2019 as a way of retaining agency over her creative legacy. (Later, she would tease a snippet of that reimagined work, with a new version of her hit 2008 single \"Love Story.\")\n\nLike surprise-dropping Folklore, like pissing off the president by endorsing his opponents, like shooing away haters, Swift does what suits her. \"I don't think we often hear about women who did whatever the hell they wanted,\" she says of Harkness—something Swift is clearly intent on changing. For her, that means basking in the world of, and favorable response to, Folklore. As she says in our interview, \"I have this weird thing where, in order to create the next thing, I attack the previous thing. I don't love that I do that, but it is the thing that has kept me pivoting to another world every time I make an album. But with this one, I still love it.\"\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: We've spent the year quarantined in our houses, trying to stay healthy and avoiding friends and family. Were you surprised by your ability to create and release a full album in the middle of a pandemic?\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT: I was. I wasn't expecting to make an album. Early on in quarantine, I started watching lots of films. We would watch a different movie every night. I'm ashamed to say I hadn't seen Pan's Labyrinth before. One night I'd watch that, then I'd watch L.A. Confidential, then we'd watch Rear Window, then we'd watch Jane Eyre. I feel like consuming other people's art and storytelling sort of opened this portal in my imagination and made me feel like, \"Well, why have I never done this before? Why have I never created characters and intersecting story lines? And why haven't I ever sort of freed myself up to do that from a narrative standpoint?\" There is something a little heavy about knowing when you put out an album, people are going to take it so literally that everything you say could be clickbait. It was really, really freeing to be able to just be inspired by worlds created by the films you watch or books you've read or places you've dreamed of or people that you've wondered about, not just being inspired by your own experience.\n\nIn that vein, what's it like to sit down and write something like \"Betty,\" which is told from the perspective of a 17-year-old boy?\n\nThat was huge for me. And I think it came from the fact that my co-writer, William Bowery [Joe Alwyn], is male—and he was the one who originally thought of the chorus melody. And hearing him sing it, I thought, \"That sounds really cool.\" Obviously, I don't have a male voice, but I thought, \"I could have a male perspective.\" Patty Griffin wrote this song, \"Top of the World.\" It's one of my favorite songs of all time, and it's from the perspective of this older man who has lived a life full of regret, and he's kind of taking stock of that regret. So, I thought, \"This is something that people I am a huge fan of have done. This would be fun to kind of take this for a spin.\"\n\nWhat are your favorite William Bowery conspiracies?\n\nI love them all individually and equally. I love all the conspiracy theories around this album. [With] \"Betty,\" Jack Antonoff would text me these articles and think pieces and in-depth Tumblr posts on what this love triangle meant to the person who had listened to it. And that's exactly what I was hoping would happen with this album. I wrote these stories for a specific reason and from a specific place about specific people that I imagined, but I wanted that to all change given who was listening to it. And I wanted it to start out as mine and become other people's. It's been really fun to watch.\n\nTaylor Swift's Entertainer of the Year cover reunites the pop star with her 'Folklore' photographer, Beth Garrabrant.\nTaylor Swift's Entertainer of the Year cover reunites the pop star with her 'Folklore' photographer, Beth Garrabrant. BETH GARRABRANT FOR EW\nOne of the other unique things about Folklore—the parameters around it were completely different from anything you'd done. There was no long roll out, no stadium-sized pop anthems, no aiming for the radio-friendly single. How fearful were you in avoiding what had worked in the past?\n\nI didn't think about any of that for the very first time. And a lot of this album was kind of distilled down to the purest version of what the story is. Songwriting on this album is exactly the way that I would write if I considered nothing else other than, \"What words do I want to write? What stories do I want to tell? What melodies do I want to sing? What production is essential to tell those stories?\" It was a very do-it-yourself experience. My management team, we created absolutely everything in advance—every lyric video, every individual album package. And then we called our label a week in advance and said, \"Here's what we have.\" The photo shoot was me and the photographer walking out into a field. I'd done my hair and makeup and brought some nightgowns. These experiences I was used to having with 100 people on set, commanding alongside other people in a very committee fashion—all of a sudden it was me and a photographer, or me and my DP. It was a new challenge, because I love collaboration. But there's something really fun about knowing what you can do if it's just you doing it.\n\nDid you find it freeing?\n\nI did. Every project involves different levels of collaboration, because on other albums there are things that my stylist will think of that I never would've thought of. But if I had all those people on the photo shoot, I would've had to have them quarantine away from their families for weeks on end, and I would've had to ask things of them that I didn't think were fair if I could figure out a way to do it [myself]. I had this idea for the [Folklore album cover] that it would be this girl sleepwalking through the forest in a nightgown in 1830 [laughs]. Very specific. A pioneer woman sleepwalking at night. I made a moodboard and sent it to Beth [Garrabrant], who I had never worked with before, who shoots only on film. We were just carrying bags across a field and putting the bags of film down, and then taking pictures. It was a blast.\n\nFolklore includes plenty of intimate acoustic echoes to what you've done in the past. But there are also a lot of new sonics here, too—these quiet, powerful, intricately layered harmonics. What was it like to receive the music from Aaron and try to write lyrics on top of it?\n\nWell, Aaron is one of the most effortlessly prolific creators I've ever worked with. It's really mind-blowing. And every time I've spoken to an artist since this whole process [began], I said, \"You need to work with him. It'll change the way you create.\" He would send me these—he calls them sketches, but it's basically an instrumental track. The second day—the day after I texted him and said, \"Hey, would you ever want to work together?\"—he sent me this file of probably 30 of these instrumentals and every single one of them was one of the most interesting, exciting things I had ever heard. Music can be beautiful, but it can be lacking that evocative nature. There was something about everything he created that is an immediate image in my head or melody that I came up with. So much so that I'd start writing as soon as I heard a new one. And oftentimes what I would send back would inspire him to make more instrumentals and then send me that one. And then I wrote the song and it started to shape the project, form-fitted and customized to what we wanted to do.\n\nIt was weird because I had never made an album and not played it for my girlfriends or told my friends. The only people who knew were the people that I was making it with, my boyfriend, my family, and then my management team. So that's the smallest number of people I've ever had know about something. I'm usually playing it for everyone that I'm friends with. So I had a lot of friends texting me things like, \"Why didn't you say on our everyday FaceTimes you were making a record?\"\n\nWas it nice to be able to keep it a secret?\n\nWell, it felt like it was only my thing. It felt like such an inner world I was escaping to every day that it almost didn't feel like an album. Because I wasn't making a song and finishing it and going, \"Oh my God, that is catchy.\" I wasn't making these things with any purpose in mind. And so it was almost like having it just be mine was this really sweet, nice, pure part of the world as everything else in the world was burning and crashing and feeling this sickness and sadness. I almost didn't process it as an album. This was just my daydream space.\n\nDoes it still feel like that?\n\nYeah, because I love it so much. I have this weird thing that I do when I create something where in order to create the next thing I kind of, in my head, attack the previous thing. I don't love that I do that but it is the thing that has kept me pivoting to another world every time I make an album. But with this one, I just still love it. I'm so proud of it. And so that feels very foreign to me. That doesn't feel like a normal experience that I've had with releasing albums.\n\nWhen did you first learn about Rebekah Harkness?\n\nOh, I learned about her as soon as I was being walked through [her former Rhode Island] home. I got the house when I was in my early twenties as a place for my family to congregate and be together. I was told about her, I think, by the real estate agent who was walking us through the property. And as soon as I found out about her, I wanted to know everything I could. So I started reading. I found her so interesting. And then as more parallels began to develop between our two lives—being the lady that lives in that house on the hill that everybody gets to gossip about—I was always looking for an opportunity to write about her. And I finally found it.\n\n\nI love that you break the fourth wall in the song. Did you go in thinking you'd include yourself in the story?\n\nI think that in my head, I always wanted to do a country music, standard narrative device, which is: the first verse you sing about someone else, the second verse you sing about someone else who's even closer to you, and then in the third verse, you go, \"Surprise! It was me.\" You bring it personal for the last verse. And I'd always thought that if I were to tell that story, I would want to include the similarities—our lives or our reputations or our scandals.\n\nHow often did you regale friends about the history of Rebekah and Holiday House while hanging out at Holiday House?\n\nAnyone who's been there before knows that I do \"The Tour,\" in quotes, where I show everyone through the house. And I tell them different anecdotes about each room, because I've done that much research on this house and this woman. So in every single room, there's a different anecdote about Rebekah Harkness. If you have a mixed group of people who've been there before and people who haven't, [the people who've been there] are like, \"Oh, she's going to do the tour. She's got to tell you the story about how the ballerinas used to practice on the lawn.\" And they'll go get a drink and skip it because it's the same every time. But for me, I'm telling the story with the same electric enthusiasm, because it's just endlessly entertaining to me that this fabulous woman lived there. She just did whatever she wanted.\n\nThere are a handful of songs on Folklore that feel like pretty clear nods to your personal life over the last year, including your relationships with Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun. How long did it take to crystallize the feelings you had around both of them into \"My Tears Ricochet\" or \"Mad Woman\"?\n\nI found myself being very triggered by any stories, movies, or narratives revolving around divorce, which felt weird because I haven't experienced it directly. There's no reason it should cause me so much pain, but all of a sudden it felt like something I had been through. I think that happens any time you've been in a 15-year relationship and it ends in a messy, upsetting way. So I wrote \"My Tears Ricochet\" and I was using a lot of imagery that I had conjured up while comparing a relationship ending to when people end an actual marriage. All of a sudden this person that you trusted more than anyone in the world is the person that can hurt you the worst. Then all of a sudden the things that you have been through together, hurt. All of a sudden, the person who was your best friend is now your biggest nemesis, etc. etc. etc. I think I wrote some of the first lyrics to that song after watching Marriage Story and hearing about when marriages go wrong and end in such a catastrophic way. So these songs are in some ways imaginary, in some ways not, and in some ways both.\n\nHow did it feel to drop an F-bomb on \"Mad Woman\"?\n\nF---ing fantastic.\n\nAnd that's the first time you ever recorded one on a record, right?\n\nYeah. Every rule book was thrown out. I always had these rules in my head and one of them was, You haven't done this before, so you can't ever do this. \"Well, you've never had an explicit sticker, so you can't ever have an explicit sticker.\" But that was one of the times where I felt like you need to follow the language and you need to follow the story line. And if the story line and the language match up and you end up saying the F-word, just go for it. I wasn't adhering to any of the guidelines that I had placed on myself. I decided to just make what I wanted to make. And I'm really happy that the fans were stoked about that because I think they could feel that. I'm not blaming anyone else for me restricting myself in the past. That was all, I guess, making what I want to make. I think my fans could feel that I opened the gate and ran out of the pasture for the first time, which I'm glad they picked up on because they're very intuitive.\n\nTaylor Swift\nThe stories behind Swift's 2020 album were further illuminated in Disney+'s Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions.. DISNEY+\nLet's talk about \"Epiphany.\" The first verse is a nod to your grandfather, Dean, who fought in World War II. What does his story mean to you personally?\n\nI wanted to write about him for awhile. He died when I was very young, but my dad would always tell this story that the only thing that his dad would ever say about the war was when somebody would ask him, \"Why do you have such a positive outlook on life?\" My grandfather would reply, \"Well, I'm not supposed to be here. I shouldn't be here.\" My dad and his brothers always kind of imagined that what he had experienced was really awful and traumatic and that he'd seen a lot of terrible things. So when they did research, they learned that he had fought at the Battles of Guadalcanal, at Cape Gloucester, at Talasea, at Okinawa. He had seen a lot of heavy fire and casualties—all of the things that nightmares are made of. He was one of the first people to sign up for the war. But you know, these are things that you can only imagine that a lot of people in that generation didn't speak about because, a) they didn't want people that they came home to to worry about them, and b) it just was so bad that it was the actual definition of unspeakable.\n\nThat theme continues in the next verse, which is a pretty overt nod to what's been happening during COVID. As someone who lives in Nashville, how difficult has it been to see folks on Lower Broadway crowding the bars without masks?\n\nI mean, you just immediately think of the health workers who are putting their lives on the line—and oftentimes losing their lives. If they make it out of this, if they see the other side of it, there's going to be a lot of trauma that comes with that; there's going to be things that they witnessed that they will never be able to un-see. And that was the connection that I drew. I did a lot of research on my grandfather in the beginning of quarantine, and it hit me very quickly that we've got a version of that trauma happening right now in our hospitals. God, you hope people would respect it and would understand that going out for a night isn't worth the ripple effect that it causes. But obviously we're seeing that a lot of people don't seem to have their eyes open to that—or if they do, a lot of people don't care, which is upsetting.\n\nYou had the Lover Fest East and West scheduled this year. How hard has it been to both not perform for your fans this year, and see the music industry at large go through such a brutal change?\n\nIt's confusing. It's hard to watch. I think that maybe me wanting to make as much music as possible during this time was a way for me to feel like I could reach out my hand and touch my fans, even if I couldn't physically reach out or take a picture with them. We've had a lot of different, amazing, fun, sort of underground traditions we've built over the years that involve a lot of human interaction, and so I have no idea what's going to happen with touring; none of us do. And that's a scary thing. You can't look to somebody in the music industry who's been around a long time, or an expert touring manager or promoter and [ask] what's going to happen and have them give you an answer. I think we're all just trying to keep our eyes on the horizon and see what it looks like. So we're just kind of sitting tight and trying to take care of whatever creative spark might exist and trying to figure out how to reach our fans in other ways, because we just can't do that right now.\n\nWhen you are able to perform again, do you have plans on resurfacing a Lover Fest-type event?\n\nI don't know what incarnation it'll take and I really would need to sit down and think about it for a good solid couple of months before I figured out the answer. Because whatever we do, I want it to be something that is thoughtful and will make the fans happy and I hope I can achieve that. I'm going to try really hard to.\n\nIn addition to recording an album, you spent this year supporting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the election. Where were you when it was called in their favor?\n\nWell, when the results were coming in, I was actually at the property where we shot the Entertainment Weekly cover. I was hanging out with my photographer friend, Beth, and the wonderful couple that owned the farm where we [were]. And we realized really early into the night that we weren't going to get an accurate picture of the results. Then, a couple of days later, I was on a video shoot, but I was directing, and I was standing there with my face shield and mask on next to my director of photography, Rodrigo Prieto. And I just remember a news alert coming up on my phone that said, \"Biden is our next president. He's won the election.\" And I showed it to Rodrigo and he said, \"I'm always going to remember the moment that we learned this.\" And I looked around, and people's face shields were starting to fog up because a lot of people were really misty-eyed and emotional, and it was not loud. It wasn't popping bottles of champagne. It was this moment of quiet, cautious elation and relief.\n\nDo you ever think about what Folklore would have sounded like if you, Aaron, and Jack had been in the same room?\n\nI think about it all the time. I think that a lot of what has happened with the album has to do with us all being in a collective emotional place. Obviously everybody's lives have different complexities and whatnot, but I think most of us were feeling really shaken up and really out of place and confused and in need of something comforting all at the same time. And for me, that thing that was comforting was making music that felt sort of like I was trying to hug my fans through the speakers. That was truly my intent. Just trying to hug them when I can't hug them.\n\nI wanted to talk about some of the lyrics on Folklore. One of my favorite pieces of wordplay is in \"August\": that flip of \"sipped away like a bottle of wine/slipped away like a moment in time.\" Was there an \"aha moment\" for you while writing that?\n\nI was really excited about \"August slipped away into a moment of time/August sipped away like a bottle of wine.\" That was a song where Jack sent me the instrumental and I wrote the song pretty much on the spot; it just was an intuitive thing. And that was actually the first song that I wrote of the \"Betty\" triangle. So the Betty songs are \"August,\" \"Cardigan,\" and \"Betty.\" \"August\" was actually the first one, which is strange because it's the song from the other girl's perspective.\n\nYeah, I assumed you wrote \"Cardigan\" first.\n\nIt would be safe to assume that \"Cardigan\" would be first, but it wasn't. It was very strange how it happened, but it kind of pieced together one song at a time, starting with \"August,\" where I kind of wanted to explore the element of This is from the perspective of a girl who was having her first brush with love. And then all of a sudden she's treated like she's the other girl, because there was another situation that had already been in place, but \"August\" girl thought she was really falling in love. It kind of explores the idea of the undefined relationship. As humans, we're all encouraged to just be cool and just let it happen, and don't ask what the relationship is—Are we exclusive? But if you are chill about it, especially when you're young, you learn the very hard lesson that if you don't define something, oftentimes they can gaslight you into thinking it was nothing at all, and that it never happened. And how do you mourn the loss of something once it ends, if you're being made to believe that it never happened at all?\n\nTaylor Swift\n\"I almost didn't process it as an album,\" says Taylor Swift of making Folklore. \"And it's still hard for me to process as an entity or a commodity, because [it] was just my daydream space.\". BETH GARRABRANT FOR EW\nOn the flip side, \"Peace\" is bit more defined in terms of how one approaches a relationship. There's this really striking line, \"The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me/Would it be enough if I can never give you peace?\" How did that line come to you?\n\nI'm really proud of that one too. I heard the track immediately. Aaron sent it to me, and it had this immediate sense of serenity running through it. The first word that popped into my head was peace, but I thought that it would be too on-the-nose to sing about being calm, or to sing about serenity, or to sing about finding peace with someone. Because you have this very conflicted, very dramatic conflict-written lyric paired with this very, very calming sound of the instrumental. But, \"The devil's in the details,\" is one of those phrases that I've written down over the years. That's a common phrase that is used in the English language every day. And I just thought it sounded really cool because of the D, D sound. And I thought, \"I'll hang onto those in a list, and then, I'll finally find the right place for them in a story.\" I think that's how a lot of people feel where it's like, \"Yeah, the devil's in the details. Everybody's complex when you look under the hood of the car.\" But basically saying, \"I'm there for you if you want that, if this complexity is what you want.\"\n\nThere's another clever turn of phrase on \"This is Me Trying.\" \"I didn't know if you'd care if I came back/I have a lot of regrets about that.\" That feels like a nod toward your fans, and some of the feelings you had about retreating from the public sphere.\n\nAbsolutely. I think I was writing from three different characters' perspectives, one who's going through that; I was channeling the emotions I was feeling in 2016, 2017, where I just felt like I was worth absolutely nothing. And then, the second verse is about dealing with addiction and issues with struggling every day. And every second of the day, you're trying not to fall into old patterns, and nobody around you can see that, and no one gives you credit for it. And then, the third verse, I was thinking, what would the National do? What lyric would Matt Berninger write? What chords would the National play? And it's funny because I've since played this song for Aaron, and he's like, \"That's not what we would've done at all.\" He's like, \"I love that song, but that's totally different than what we would've done with it.\"\n\nWhen we last spoke, in April 2019, we were talking about albums we were listening to at the time and you professed your love for the National and I Am Easy to Find. Two months later, you met up with Aaron at their concert, and now, we're here talking about the National again.\n\nYeah, I was at the show where they were playing through I Am Easy to Find. What I loved about [that album] was they had female vocalists singing from female perspectives, and that triggered and fired something in me where I thought, \"I've got to play with different perspectives because that is so intriguing when you hear a female perspective come in from a band where you're used to only hearing a male perspective.\" It just sparked something in me. And obviously, you mentioning the National is the reason why Folklore came to be. So, thank you for that, Alex.\n\n[Laughs] I'm here for all of your songwriting muse needs in the future.\n\nI can't wait to see what comes out of this interview.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Aaron Dessner on the ‘Weird Avalanche’ That Resulted in Taylor Swift’s ‘Evermore’\nThe prolific multi-hyphenate reveals how the Folklore sister album came to be, and why he and Swift will \"make music together forever.\"\n\nBy Lyndsey Havens \n\n12/18/2020\n\nOne day this fall, Taylor Swift walked into Aaron Dessner’s home to wish his daughter a happy 9th birthday — but that wasn’t the only reason Swift was there.\n\nShe was mostly there to film the Disney+ special, Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, in which she was meeting up with her primary Folklore collaborators — The National’s Dessner and Jack Antonoff. They had all gathered for the first time at Dessner’s upstate New York studio to play her record-breaking album live.\n\n EXPLORE\nSEE LATEST VIDEOS, CHARTS AND NEWS\n\n\nAaron Dessner\n\nTaylor Swift\n RELATED\nTaylor Swift\n11 Things We Learned From Taylor Swift's 'Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions'\n11/25/2020\nThe indie-folk project — which was created remotely, with the multi-hyphenate Dessner putting the pieces together at Long Pond — became Swift’s only album to spend its first six weeks atop the Billboard 200. It earned Dessner two Grammy nominations, both in Big Four categories, for album of the year and song of the year (for “Cardigan”). It also ushered in a new songwriting style for Swift: first-person fiction.\n\nOn the last night of filming the special (a process that was done while following CDC guidelines, with a limited crew and COVID-19 testing), Dessner recalls how he, Antonoff and Swift stayed up until 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. — drinking and celebrating the more-than-warm embrace Folklore had received. But in the days that followed, Swift ended up staying, and she and Dessner unexpectedly continued working. Eventually, they had 17 more songs, all of which became the sister album, Evermore, released on Dec. 11.\n\n RELATED\nAaron Dessner Interview: 'Evermore' & Taylor Swift\nTaylor Swift, Dua Lipa and More Innovated In the Pandemic — But What Strategies Will Stick?\n12/18/2020\n“Folklore almost immediately was treated as a classic or a masterpiece,” says Dessner. “It was elevated fairly quickly and had been commercially really successful, so obviously it’s hard to follow something like that up. But one of the things I love about [Evermore] is the ways in which [Taylor] was jumping off different cliffs. The ability she has to tell these stories, but also push what she’s doing musically, is really kind of astonishing. It’s like I went to some crash course, some masters program, for six months.”\n\nBelow, Dessner tells Billboard all about the work that went into his second album in five months with one of the world’s biggest pop stars.\n\nWith Folklore a lot of the production and arrangements came from a folder you had sent Taylor. Did you continue to pull from there, or was Evermore made from scratch?\n\nA lot more of it was made from scratch. After Folklore came out, I think Taylor had written two songs early on that we both thought were for Big Red Machine, “Closure” and “Dorothea.” But the more I listened to them, not that they couldn’t be Big Red Machine songs, but they felt like interesting, exciting Taylor songs. “Closure” is very experimental and in this weird time signature, but still lyrically felt like some evolution of Folklore, and “Dorothea” definitely felt like it was reflecting on some character.\n\nAnd I, sort of in celebration of Folklore, had written a piece of music that I titled “Westerly,” that’s where she has the house that she wrote “Last Great American Dynasty” about. I’ll do that sometimes, just make things for friends or write music just to write it, but I didn’t at all think it would become a song. And she, like an hour later, sent back “Willow” written to that song, and that sort of set [things in motion] and we just started filling this Dropbox again. It was kind of like, “What’s happening?”\n\nAnd then it just kept going. She wrote “Gold Rush” with Jack [Antonoff] and by the end there were 17 songs, and it was only a couple months after Folklore came out, so it’s pretty wild. Each time we would just be in disbelief and kind of like, “How is this possible?” Especially because we didn’t need to talk much about structure or ideas or anything — it was just this weird avalanche.\n\nConsidering how industry-shaking Folklore was, what pressure did that introduce this time around?\n\nI think because of how we made it, it really wasn’t like producing some giant record or something, it still had this very homespun feeling to it. There may have been a moment or two when I think Taylor was wondering when and how to put out Evermore, but I think the stronger it became, and as each song came together, it just started to feel like, “This is a sister record — it’s part of the same current of creativity and collaboration and the stories feel inter-related.”\n\nAnd aesthetically, to me, Evermore is wilder and has more of a band dynamic at times. You can feel her songwriting sharpen even more on it, in terms of storytelling, and also just this freedom to make the kinds of songs that were coming. When she started to write in a less diaristic way and tell these stories, I think she found she had this incredible wealth of experience and depth to her storytelling that was quite natural. She could easily make these songs more reflective or blur the lines of what’s autobiographical and what’s not in interesting ways. It felt like the most natural thing in the world.\n\n\n\nFolklore was made entirely remotely, how did that process change for Evermore? \n\nThis was both. Some of it was remote, but then after the Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, [Taylor] stayed for quite a while and we recorded a lot. She actually wrote “‘Tis the Damn Season” when she arrived for the first day of rehearsal. We played all night and drank a lot of wine after the fireside chat — and we were all pretty drunk, to be honest — and then I thought she went to bed. But the next morning, at 9:00 a.m. or something, she showed up and was like, “I have to sing you this song,” and she had written it in the middle of the night. That was definitely another moment [where] my brain exploded, because she sang it to me in my kitchen, and it was just surreal.\n\nThat music is actually older — it’s something I wrote many years ago, and hid away because I loved it so much. It meant something to me, and it felt like the perfect song finally found it. There was a feeling in it, and she identified that feeling: That feeling of… “The ache in you, put there by the ache in me.” I think everyone can relate to that. It’s one of my favorites.\n\nDid you watch the Disney+ special?\n\nI’m not a big fan of watching myself — but I did watch it, and I thought it was beautiful. It’s funny, because it was very DIY in a sense; a tight little small crew was there to do it, nobody was styling us or fixing our hair or anything like that, it’s very authentic. I rehearsed a little bit before, but both of us — Jack and I — were pretty much figuring it out as we went.\n\nAnd I think the nice thing is that all of the songs could work like that, and that’s partly a testament to the strength of the album. Without big production tricks or backing vocals or anything like that, the songs stand up, and Taylor just sang the crap out of them. And hanging out with them was so much fun. They’re kind of like siblings almost; they’ve known each other a long time, there’s this quick humor between them.\n\nWould you like to do something like that again with Evermore?\n\nI don’t know if you can recreate exactly what we did with Folklore. I haven’t actually talked to anyone about that. But to me, the songs of Evermore would be even more fun to play, because more of them feel like band songs. But, that being said, I won’t be disappointed if we don’t — there is no plan afoot right now to do that.\n\nDuring an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live! Jimmy asked Taylor about the rumors behind Woodvale and if there’s a third album coming, to which she said she’s exhausted. How are you feeling energy wise?\n\nI think we both feel like it was Mission: Impossible — and we pulled it off. I imagine that we’ll make music together in some ways forever, because it was that sort of chemistry, and I’m so thankful and grateful for what happened, but I think there’s a lot there. It’s not just the two albums, there’s also bonus tracks, and two of my favorite songs aren’t even on this record. We’re not pouring into another one now.\n\nI’m going to finish the Big Red Machine album — I was really very close to finishing it when all of a sudden the Folklore and Evermore vortex opened up, and actually Taylor has been really helpful and involved with that as well — and The National is starting to talk about making music, and I think she’ll probably take a break. But I’m so excited for any future things we might do — it’s definitely a lifelong relationship. And I’d say the same for all the people who worked on these records, including my brother and everybody who contributed. It’s a really special legacy.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Aaron Dessner on How His Collaborative Chemistry With Taylor Swift Led to ‘Evermore’\n\"I've rarely had this kind of chemistry with anyone in my life — to be able to write together, to make so many beautiful songs together in such a short period of time,\" National member says\n\nBY CLAIRE SHAFFER\n\nDECEMBER 18, 2020\nAaron Dessner Talks Taylor Swift's 'Evermore'\nAARON GOODWIN*; BETH GARRABRANT*\nTaylor Swift and Aaron Dessner didn’t expect to make another record so soon after Folklore. As they were putting the final touches on Swift’s album this past summer, the two artists had been collaborating remotely on possible songs for Big Red Machine, Dessner’s music project with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver (who also dueted with Swift on the Folklore track “Exile”).\n\n“I think I’d written around 30 of those instrumentals in total,” Dessner recalls. “So when I started sharing them with Taylor over the months that we were working on Folklore, she got really into it, and she wrote two songs to some of that music.”\n\nOne was “Closure,” an experimental electronic track in 5/4 time signature that was built over a staccato drum kit. The other song was “Dorothea,” a rollicking, Americana piano tune. The more Dessner listened to them, the more he realized that they were continuations of Folklore‘s characters and stories. But the real turning point came soon after Folklore‘s surprise release in late July, when Dessner wrote a musical sketch and named it “Westerly,” after the town in Rhode Island where Swift owns the house previously occupied by Rebekah Harkness.\n\n“I didn’t really think she would write something to it — sometimes I’ll name songs after my friends’ hometowns or their babies, just because I write a lot of music and you have to call it something, and then I’ll send it to them,” Dessner says. “But, anyway, I sent it to her, and not long after she wrote ‘Willow’ to that song and sent it back.”\n\nIt was a moment not unlike when Swift first sent him the song “Cardigan” back in the spring, where both she and Dessner felt an instant creative spark — and then just kept writing. Before long, they were creating even more songs with Vernon, Jack Antonoff, Dessner’s brother Bryce, and “William Bowery” (the pseudonym of Swift’s boyfriend Joe Alwyn) for what would eventually lead to Folklore‘s wintry sister record, Evermore.\n\nEven more spontaneous than the album that preceded it, Evermore features more eclectic production alongside Swift’s continued project of character-driven songwriting, and includes an even wider group of collaborators, like Haim and Dessner’s own band the National. Dessner spoke to Rolling Stone about the album’s experimentation, how it was recorded during the making of the doc The Long Pond Studio Sessions, and how he sees his collaboration with Swift continuing in the future.\n\nEDITOR’S PICKS\nEvery Awful Thing Trump Has Promised to Do in a Second Term\nThe 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\nThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\nThe 50 Worst Decisions in Movie History\nWhen did you realize this was going to end up being another album?\n\nIt was after we’d written several [songs], seven or eight or nine. Each one would happen, and we would both be in this sort of disbelief of this weird alchemy that we had unleashed. The ideas were coming fast and furiously and were just as compelling as anything on Folklore, and it felt like the most natural thing in the world. At some point, Taylor wrote “Evermore” with William Bowery, and then we sent it to Justin, who wrote the bridge, and all of a sudden, that’s when it started to become clear that there was a sister record. Historically, there are examples of this, of records which came in close succession that I love — certain Dylan records, Kid A and Amnesiac. I secretly fell in love with the idea that this was part of the same current, and that these were two manifestations that were interrelated. And with Taylor, I think it just became clear to her what was happening. It really picked up steam, and at some point, there were 17 songs — because there are two bonus tracks, which I love just as much.\n\nEvermore definitely sounds more experimental than Folklore, and has more variety — you have these electronic songs that sound like Bon Iver or Big Red Machine, but you also have the closest thing Taylor has written to country songs in the last decade. Was there a conscious effort on her part to branch out more with this album?\n\nSonically, the ideas were coming from me more. But I remember when I wrote the piano track to “Tolerate It,” right before I sent it to her, I thought, This song is intense. It’s in 10/8, which is an odd time signature. And I did think for a second, “Maybe I shouldn’t send it to her, she won’t be into it.” But I sent it to her, and it conjured a scene in her mind, and she wrote this crushingly beautiful song to it and sent it back. I think I cried when I first heard it. But it just felt like the most natural thing, you know? There weren’t limitations to the process. And in these places where we were pushing into more experimental sounds or odd time signatures, that just felt like part of the work.\n\nRELATED\nWatch Taylor Swift Debut 'The Tortured Poets Department' Title Track in Lisbon\nSee Taylor Swift Perform 'Fresh Out the Slammer' for First Time in Lisbon\nIt was really impressive to me that she could tell these stories as easily in something like “Closure” as she could in a country song like “Cowboy Like Me.” Obviously, “Cowboy Like Me” is much more familiar, musically. But to me, she’s just as sharp and just as masterful in her craft in either of those situations. And also, just in terms of what we were interested in, there is a wintry nostalgia to a lot of the music that was intentional on my part. I was leaning into the idea that this was fall and winter, and she’s talked about that as well, that Folklore feels like spring and summer to her and Evermore is fall and winter. So that’s why you hear sleigh bells on “Ivy,” or why some of the imagery in the songs is wintery.\n\nI can hear that in the guitar on “‘Tis the Damn Season,” too. It almost sounds like the National with that very icy guitar line.\n\nI mean, that is literally like, me in my most natural state. [laughs] If you hand me a guitar, that’s what it sounds like when I start playing it. People associate that sound with the National, but that’s just because I finger-pick an electric guitar like that a lot — if you solo the guitar on “Mr. November,” it’s not unlike that.\n\nThat song, to me, has always felt nostalgic or like some sort of longing. And the song that Taylor wrote is so instantly relatable, you know, “There’s an ache in you put there by the ache in me.” I remember when she sang that to me in my kitchen — she had written it overnight during The Long Pond Studio Sessions, actually.\n\nDid she record all her Evermore vocals at Long Pond while you were filming the Studio Sessions documentary?\n\nNot all of them, but most of them. She stayed after we were done filming and then we recorded a lot. It was crazy because we were getting ready to make that film, but at the same time, these songs were accumulating. And so we thought, “Hmm, I guess we should just stay and work.”\n\nOn “Closure,” there are parts where Taylor’s vocals are filtered through the Messina, which is this vocal modifier that Justin Vernon uses a lot in his work with Bon Iver. How were you able to modify her vocals with it, if she was never in the same room as Justin?\n\nI went to see Justin at one point — that’s the one trip I’ve made — and we worked together at his place on stuff. He plays the drums on “Cowboy Like Me” and “Closure,” and he plays guitar and banjo and sings on “Ivy,” and sings on “Marjorie” and “Evermore.” And then we processed Taylor’s vocals through his Messina chain together. He was really deeply involved in this record, even more so than the last record. He’s always been such a huge help to me, and not just by getting him to play stuff or sing stuff — I can also send him things and get his feedback. We’ve done a ton of work together, but we have different perspectives and different harmonic brains. He obviously has his own studio set up at home, but it was nice to be able to see him and work on this stuff.\n\n“No Body, No Crime” is also really interesting, just because I don’t think I’ve ever heard you produce a song like that. How did this country murder ballad featuring Haim end up on the record?\n\nTaylor wrote that one alone and sent me a voice memo of her playing guitar — she wrote it on this rubber-bridge guitar that I got for her. It’s the same kind I play on “Invisible String.” So she wrote “No Body, No Crime” and sent me a voice memo of it, and then I started building on that. It’s funny, because the music I’ve listened to the most in my life are things that are more like that — roots music, folk music, country music, old-school rock & roll, the Grateful Dead. It’s not really the sound of the National or other things I’ve done, but it feels like a warm blanket.\n\nThat song also had a lot of my friends on it — Josh Kaufman, who played harmonica on “Betty,” also plays harmonica on this one and some guitar. JT Bates plays the drums on that song — he’s an amazing jazz guitarist, but he also has an incredible feel [for rhythm] when it comes to a song like that. He also played the drums on “Dorothea.” And then Taylor had specific ideas from the beginning about references and how she wanted it to feel, and that she wanted the Haim sisters to sing on it. We had them record the song with Ariel Reichshaid, they sent that from L.A., and then we put it together when Taylor was here [at Long Pond]. They’re an incredible band, and it was another situation where we were like, “Well, this happened.” It felt like this weird little rock & roll history anecdote.\n\nYou also brought on the National to record “Coney Island.” What was that process like, where you’re recording a song with your band that’s for a different artist?\n\nI had been working on a bunch of music with my brother [Bryce Dessner], some of which we were sending to Taylor also. At that stage, “Coney Island” was all the music except the drums. And as I was writing it, I don’t think I was ever thinking, “This sounds like the National or this sounds like Big Red Machine or this sounds like something totally different.” But Taylor and William Bowery wrote this incredible song, and we first recorded it with just her vocals. It has this really beautiful arc to the story, and I think it’s one of the strongest, lyrically and musically. But listening to the words, we all collectively realized that this does feel like the most related to the National — it almost feels like a story Matt [Berninger] might tell, or I could hear Bryan [Devendorf] playing the drum part.\n\nSo we started talking about how it would be cool to get the band, and I called Matt and he was excited for it. We got Bryan to play drums and we got Scott [Devendorf] to play bass and a pocket piano, and Bryce helped produce it. It’s weird, because it does really feel like Taylor, obviously, since she and William Bowery wrote all the words, but it also feels like a National song in a good way. I love how Matt and Taylor sound together. And it was nice because we haven’t played a show in a year, and I don’t know when we will again. You kind of lose track of each other, so in a way, it was nice to reconnect.\n\nWhen working on Folklore, you had to keep most of your collaborators in the dark about who you were working with. What was the process like this time around, now that everyone knew it was Taylor? How did you keep it a secret?\n\nIt was hard. We had to be secretive because of how much people are consuming every shred of information they can find about her, and that’s been an oppressive reality she’s had to deal with. But the fact that no one in the public knew allowed for more freedom of enjoying the process. A lot of the same musicians that played on Folklore played on Evermore. Again, it was a situation where I didn’t tell them what it was, and they couldn’t hear her vocals, but I think a lot of them assumed, especially because of the level of secrecy. [laughs] But as funny as this is, I think everyone who’s been involved has been grateful for these records to play on this year and is proud of them. It kind of just doesn’t happen, to make two great records in such a short period of time. Everyone’s a little bit like, “How did this happen?” and nobody takes it for granted.\n\nTaylor has mentioned that you recorded “Happiness” just a week before the album was released. Was that something you guys wrote, recorded, and produced all at the last minute, or was it something you’d been sitting on for a while before you finally cracked the code?\n\nThere were two songs like that. One is a bonus track called “Right Where You Left Me,” and the other one was “Happiness,” which she wrote literally days before we were supposed to master. That’s similar to what happened with Folklore, with “The 1” and “Hoax,” which she wrote days before. We mixed all the tracks here, and it’s a lot to mix 17 songs, it’s like a Herculean task. And it was funny, because I walked into the studio and Jon Low, our engineer here, was mixing and had been working the whole time toward this. And I came in and he’s in the middle of mixing and I was like, “There are two more songs.” And he looked at me like, “…We’re not gonna make it.” Because it does take a lot of time to work out how to finish them.\n\nBut she sang those remotely. And the music for “Happiness” is something that I had been working on since last year. I had sang a little bit on it, too — I thought it was a Big Red Machine song, but then she loved the instrumental and ended up writing to it. Same with the other one, “Right Where You Left Me” — it was something I had written right before I went to visit Justin, because I thought, “Maybe we’ll make something when we’re together there.” And Taylor had heard that and wrote this amazing song to it. That is a little bit how she works — she writes a lot of songs, and then at the very end she sometimes writes one or two more, and they often are important ones.\n\nMy favorite song on the album is “Marjorie,” and I feel like, for most artists, the instinct would be to present a song like that as a somber piano ballad. But “Marjorie” has this lively electronic beat that runs through it — it literally sounds alive. How did you come up with that?\n\nIt’s interesting, because with “Marjorie,” that’s a track that actually existed for a while, and you can hear elements of it behind the song “Peace.” This weird drone that you hear on “Peace,” if you pay attention to the bridge of “Marjorie,” you’ll hear a little bit of that in the distance. Some of what you hear is from my friend Jason Treuting playing percussion, playing these chord sticks, that he actually made for a piece that my brother wrote called “Music for Wooden Strings.” They’re playing these chord sticks, and you can hear those same chord sticks on the National song “Quiet Light.”\n\nI collect a lot of rhythmic elements like that, and all kinds of other sounds, and I give them to my friend Ryan Olson, who’s a producer from Minnesota and has been developing this crazy software called Allovers Hi-Hat Generator. It can take sounds, any sounds, and split them into identifiable sound samples, and then regenerate them in randomized patterns that are weirdly very musical. There’s a lot of new Big Red Machine songs that use those elements. But I’ll go through it and find little parts that I like and loop them. That’s how I made the backing rhythm of “Marjorie.” Then I wrote a song to it, and Taylor wrote to that. In a weird way, it’s one of the most experimental songs on the album — it doesn’t sound that way, but when you pick apart the layers underneath it, it’s pretty interesting.\n\nI do have to ask: How did you come to find out about William Bowery’s real identity as Joe Alwyn? Or did you know all along?\n\nI guess I can say now that I’ve sort of known all along — I was just being careful. Although we never really explicitly talked about it. But I do think it’s been really special to see a number of songs on these albums that they wrote together. William plays the piano on “Evermore,” actually. We recorded that remotely. That was really important to me and to them, to do that, because he also wrote the piano part of “Exile,” but on the record, it’s me playing it because we couldn’t record him easily. But this time, we could. I just think it’s an important and special part of the story.\n\nDo you have a personal favorite song or a moment that you’re proudest of?\n\n“‘Tis the Damn Season” is a really special song to me for a number of reasons. When I wrote the music to it, which was a long time ago, I remember thinking that this is one of my favorite things I’ve ever made, even though it’s an incredibly simple musical sketch. But it has this arc to it, and there’s this simplicity in the minimalism of it and the kind of drum programming in there, and I always loved the tone of that guitar. When Taylor played the track and sang it to me in my kitchen, that was a highlight of this whole time. That track felt like something I have always loved and could have just stayed music, but instead, someone of her incredible storytelling ability and musical ability took it and made something much greater. And it’s something that we can all relate to. It was a really special moment, not unlike how it felt when she wrote “Peace,” but even more so.\n\nDo you see this collaboration with Taylor continuing onward, to more albums or Big Red Machine projects?\n\nIt’s kind of the thing where I have so many musicians in my life that I’ve grown close to, and make things with, and are just part of my life. And I’ve rarely had this kind of chemistry with anyone in my life — to be able to write together, to make so many beautiful songs together in such a short period of time. Inevitably, I think we will continue to be in each other’s artistic and personal lives. I don’t know exactly what the next form that will take, but certainly, it will continue.\n\nI do think this story, this era, has concluded, and I think in such a beautiful way with these sister records — it does kind of feel like there’s closure to that. But she’s definitely been very helpful and engaged with Big Red Machine, and just in general. She feels like another incredible musician that I’ve gotten to know and am lucky to have in my life. It’s this whole community that moves forward and takes risks and, hopefully, there will be other records that appear in the future.",

I asked my friend if I could use her name as the lead character, and she agreed, and then it hit me that it would be so cool if HAIM would sing on the song – Este’s band that she’s in with her sisters, Danielle and Alana. And so, it just turned into this very fun mission to create a true crime revenge song.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "“The story behind writing Coney Island - Aaron Dessner had sent me this track that he had created with his brother Bryce and I wrote the lyrics and the melody with William Bowery. I think I might have been coming from a place of somebody who’s been in a relationship for decades and wakes up one day and realizes that they have taken their partner completely for granted. So whether you wanna look at it from the perspective of somebody who’s in a new relationship or very long-standing relationship, I think it just really speaks to if people are trying to communicate but they’re two ships passing in the night, they’re trying to love each other but their signals are somehow missing each other - I just found that really interesting... and yeah, we’re really proud of this one. There were elements of it that immediately reminded me of Matt Berninger‘s vocal stylings and his writing, and I kind of targeted some of the lyrics of the second verse to sound sort of like what he might do - cause I hoped that he might sing on it. Because, you know, we already had two members of The National on the song, with Aaron and Bryce. So we got our wish and Matt sang on this song. I think he did an amazing job, I’m such a huge fan of the band and I’m really honored this was able to come together with The National.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript & Adaptation] Interviewer: We kind of glossed over a white whale with Taylor Swift, so I think you kind of gotta give the people at least a little five or ten minutes on that, like what was that experience like? That's like the greatest selling female artist currently.\n\nAaron Chmielewski: Yeah, it was super strange because it's just thought of her as, \"Okay, here comes another rich girl doing an album\", you know? Because she showed up the first day in a sixty-thousand dollar Lexus, and that was her first car her parents bought her around her 16th birthday. What I remember most about that was how focused she was and how much she knew herself already. For a 16 year old girl to be telling a musician, \"No don't play like that, play like this is, that's the way I want it to sound.\" Making choices like that was what really stuck. For a 16-year-old that was amazing that she had that vision and she was able to speak up and get what she wanted out of it.\n\nInterviewer: So in doing that record you worked with Nathan Chapman?\n\nAaron Chmielewski: Yeah, correct.\n\nInterviewer: So can you talk a little bit about who he is, because he's a famous producer-\n\nAaron Chmielewski: He got his big start with Taylor, just writing songs with Taylor and producing tracks just for demos. They would write a song together and he would produce a track so they could show the record label what they recorded that day. He told me this one time, \"Never make anything sound like a demo, always make it sound like a record\", and because of that he actually got the record because they were interviewing other producers in town, big name producers, like the guys who produce Faith Hill, Dann Huff and [the label wanted] Taylor to work with those guys. Taylor would do one or two songs with those guys and she just didn't like it, the label didn't like, it just wasn't working. And then they're like, \"We love what Nathan is doing, maybe Nathan should produce it.\" So Nathan ended up producing it and now we know of Nathan Chapman.\n\nInterviewer: I remember two things vividly from that point. I remember when I first saw Taylor, I was up on top of the stairs, she came in the door, she said hi, and I was like, \"Wwho is that?\" and they you guys made sure I stayed out of the studio and out of sight. The other thing I remember vividly was, I was at the desk and then Nathan was in studio A mixing one of her songs he comes out and he's like, \"There's no signal, I don't know what's going on\" and I go in there and I look and the mute button's on.\n\nAaron Chmielewski: It's always the tiny bit of things right? But yeah, Taylor was great, her family were just really sweet people. It was so strange walking down the street with them, getting pizza, hanging out with them then going back to the studio and then a year a year later it's like, \"Oh my God it's Taylor Swift!\" and everything's blowing up and I'm like, \"I was grabbing pizza with her last year!\"\n\nInterviewer: She was the first person and I think maybe one of the only people in my life that I've seen recording and then just blow up. \n\nAaron Chmielewski: Yeah, it's like capturing lightning in a bottle. It's rare that it happens, very rare, but it's cool to see, you know?",

      "Transcript/Content": "Aaron Dessner: Producing folklore And evermore\nTaylor Swift's Lockdown Albums\nMixing / Production\nBy Tom Doyle\n\nThe pandemic gave Taylor Swift a chance to explore new musical paths, with two lockdown albums co‑written and produced by the National’s Aaron Dessner.\n\nFew artists during the pandemic have been as prolific as Taylor Swift. In July 2020, she surprise‑released folklore, a double‑length album recorded entirely remotely and in isolation. It went on to become the biggest global seller of the year, with four million sales and counting. Then, in December, she repeated the trick with the 15‑song evermore, which quickly became Swift’s eighth consecutive US number one.\n\nIn contrast to her country‑music roots and the shiny synth‑pop that made her a superstar, both folklore and evermore showcased a very different Taylor Swift sound: one veering more towards atmospheric indie and folk. The former album was part‑produced by Swift and her regular co‑producer Jack Antonoff (St Vincent, Lana Del Rey), while the other half of the tracks were overseen by a new studio collaborator, Aaron Dessner of the National. For evermore, aside from one Antonoff‑assisted song, Dessner took full control of production.\n\nGood Timing\nAlthough his band are hugely popular and even won a Grammy for their 2017 album Sleep Well Beast, Aaron Dessner admits that it initially felt strange for an indie‑rock guitarist and keyboard player to be pulled into such a mainstream project. Swift had already declared herself a fan of the National, and first met the band back in 2014. Nonetheless, Dessner was still surprised when the singer sent him a text “out of the blue” last spring.\n\n“I mean, I didn’t think it was a hoax,” he laughs. “But it was very exciting and a moment where you think it’s like serendipity or something, especially in the middle of the pandemic. When she asked if I would ever consider writing with her, I just happened to have a lot of music that I had worked really hard on. So, the timing was sort of lucky. It opened up this crazy period of collaboration. It was a pretty wild ride.”\n\nLong Pond’s WSW/Siemens console is thought to be one of only three in the USA.\nLong Pond’s WSW/Siemens console is thought to be one of only three in the USA.\nPhoto: Jonathan Low\nSince 2016, Aaron Dessner has been based at his self‑built rural facility, Long Pond Studio, in the Hudson Valley, upstate New York. The only major change to the studio since SOS last spoke to Dessner in October 2017 has been the addition of a vintage WSW Siemens console built in 1965. “It had been refurbished by someone,” he says, “and I think there’s only three of them in the United States. I heard it was for sale from our friend [and the National producer/mixer] Peter Katis. That’s a huge improvement here.”\n\nAlthough the National made Sleep Well Beast and its 2019 successor I Am Easy To Find at Long Pond, the band members are scattered around the US and Europe, meaning Dessner is no stranger to remote working and file sharing. This proved to be invaluable for his work with Swift. Dessner spent the first six weeks of lockdown writing music that he believed to be for Big Red Machine, his project with Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon. Instead, many of these work‑in‑progress tracks would end up on folklore. Their first collaboration (and the album’s first single), ‘cardigan’, for instance, emerged from an idea Dessner had been working on backstage during the National’s European arena tour of Winter 2019.\n\n“I sent her a folder and in the middle of the night she sent me that song,” Dessner explains. “So, the next morning I was just listening to it, like, ‘Woah, OK, this is crazy.’”\n\nOn The Move\nAs work progressed, it quickly became apparent that Swift and Dessner were very much in tune as a songwriting and producing unit. There was very little Dessner had to do, he says, in terms of chopping vocals around to shape the top lines. “I think it’s because I’m so used to structuring things like a song, with verses and choruses and bridges,” he reckons. “In most cases, she sort of kept the form. If she had a different idea, she would tell me when she was writing and I would chop it up and send it to her. But, mostly, things kind of stayed in the form that we had.”\n\nDessner and Swift were working intensively and at high speed throughout 2020, so much so that on one occasion the producer sent the singer a track and went out for a run in the countryside around Long Pond. By the time he got back, Swift had already written ‘the last great american dynasty’ and it was waiting for him in his inbox.\n\n“That was a crazy moment,” he laughs. “One of the astonishing things about Taylor is what a brilliant songwriter she is and the clarity of her ideas and, when she has a story to tell, the way she can tell it. I think she’s just been doing it for so long, she has a facility that makes you feel like you could never do what she’s capable of. But we were a good pair because I think the music was inspiring to her in such a way that the stories were coming.”\n\nTaylor Swift finally made it to Long Pond in person in September 2020, where they recorded songs from folklore live and laid down vocals for many of the songs on evermore.\nTaylor Swift finally made it to Long Pond in person in September 2020, where they recorded songs from folklore live and laid down vocals for many of the songs on evermore.\n\nSwift’s contributions to folklore were recorded in a makeshift studio in her Los Angeles home. Laura Sisk engineered the sessions as the singer recorded her vocals, using a Neumann U47, in a neighbouring bedroom. Live contact between Swift, Sisk, Dessner and Long Pond engineer Jonathan Low was done through real‑time online collaboration platform Audiomovers.\n\n“We would listen in remotely and kind of go back and forth,” says Dessner. “We used Audiomovers and then we would have Zoom as a backup. But mainly we were just using Audiomovers, so we could actually be in her headphones. It’s powerful, it’s great. I’ve used it a lot with people during this time. Then, later on, when we recorded evermore, a lot of the vocals were done here at the studio actually when Taylor was visiting when we did the [Disney+ documentary] Long Pond Sessions. But Taylor’s vocals for folklore were all done remotely.”\n\nKeeping Secrets\nGiven the huge international interest in Swift, the team had to work with an elaborate file‑sharing arrangement to ensure that the tracks didn’t leak online. Understandably, Dessner won’t be drawn on the specifics. “Yeah, I mean we had to be very careful, so everything was very secretive,” he says. “There were passwords on both ends and we communicated in a specific way when sharing mixes and everything. There was a high level of confidentiality and data encryption. It was sort of a learning curve.\n\n“I’m not used to that,” he adds, “’cause usually we’re just letting files kind of fly all over the internet [laughs]. But I think with someone like her, there’s just so many people that are paying attention to every move that she makes, which can be a little, I think, oppressive for her. We tried to make it as comfortable as possible and we got used to how to get things to her and back to us. It worked pretty well.”\n\nDrums & Guitars\nFor the generally minimalist beat programming on the records, Dessner would sometimes turn to his more expensive new analogue drum generators — Vermona’s DRM1 and Dave Smith’s Tempest — but more often used the Synthetic Bits iOS app FunkBox. “There’s just a lot of great vintage drum machine sounds in there, and they sound pretty cool, especially if you overdrive it,” he says. “Often I send that through an amplifier, or through effects into an amplifier. Then I have a [Roland] TR‑8 and a TR‑8S that I use a lot. I also use the drum machine in the [Teenage Engineering] OP‑1. So, a song like ‘willow’, that’s just me tapping the OP‑1.”\n\nElsewhere, Dessner’s guitar work appears on the tracks, with the intricate melodic layering on ‘the last great american dynasty’ from folklore having been inspired by Radiohead’s In Rainbows. “Almost all of the electric guitar on Taylor’s records is played direct through a REDDI DI into the Siemens board,” he says. “It’s usually just my 1971 Telecaster played direct and it just sounds great. Oftentimes I just put a little spring reverb on it and sometimes I’ll overdrive the board like it’s an amplifier, ’cause it breaks up really beautifully.\n\n“I have a 1965 [Gibson] Firebird that I play usually through this 1965 Fender Deluxe Reverb. So, if I am playing into an amp, that’s what it is. But on ‘the last great american dynasty’, those little pointillistic guitars, that’s just played direct with the Telecaster through the board.”\n\nElsewhere, Aaron Dessner took Taylor Swift even further out of her sonic comfort zone. A key track on folklore, the Cocteau Twins‑styled ‘epiphany’, features her voice amid a wash of ambient textures, created by Dessner slowing down and reversing various instrumental parts in Pro Tools. “I created a drone using the Mellotron [MD4000D] and the Prophet and the OP‑1 and all kinds of synth pads,” he says. “Then I duplicated all the tracks, and some of them I reversed and some of them I dropped an octave. All manner of using varispeed and Polyphonic Elastic Audio and changing where they were sitting. Just to create like this Icelandic glacier of sounds was my idea. Then I wrote the chord progression against that.\n\n“The [Pro Tools] session was not happy,” he adds with a chuckle. “It kept crashing. Eventually I had to print the drone but I printed it by myself and there was some crackle in it. It was distorting. And then I couldn’t recreate it so Jon Low, who was helping me, was kind of mad at me ’cause he was like, ‘You can’t do that.’ And I was like, ‘Well, I was working quickly. I didn’t know it’d become a song.’”\n\nOrchestra Of Nowhere\nMeanwhile, the orchestrations that appear on several of the tracks were scored by Aaron’s twin brother and National bandmate, Bryce Dessner, who is located in France. “I would just make him chord charts of the songs and send them to him in France,” Aaron says. “Then he would orchestrate things in Sibelius and send the parts to me. I would send the parts and the instrumental tracks to different players remotely and they would record them literally in their bedrooms or in their attics. None of it was done as a group, it was all done separately. But that’s how we’ve always worked in the National so it’s quite natural.”\n\nCabin Fever\nOn folklore standout track ‘exile’, Justin Vernon of Bon Iver delivered his stirring vocal for the duet remotely from his home in Eaux Claires, Wisconsin. “He’s renovating his studio, so he has a little home studio in his garage,” says Dessner. “It was Taylor’s idea to approach him. I sent him Taylor’s voice memo of her singing both parts, and he got really excited and loved the song and then he wrote the extra part in the bridge.\n\n“I do a lot of work remotely with Justin also, so it was easy to send him tracks and he would track to it and send back his vocals. I was sending him stems, so usually it’s just a vocal stem of Taylor and an instrumental stem and then if he wants something deeper, I’ll give him more stems. But generally, he’s just working with the vocal layers and an instrumental.”\n\nVernon also provided the grainy beat that kicks off ‘closure’, one of two tracks on evermore that started life as a sketch for the second Big Red Machine album. “It was this little loop that Justin had given me in this folder of ‘Starters’, he calls them. I had heard that and been playing the piano to it. But I was hearing it in 5/4, although it’s not in 5/4. ‘Closure’ really opened everything up further. There were no real limits to where we were gonna try to write songs.”\n\nGiven the number of remote players, Dessner says there were surprisingly few problems with the file swapping and that it was a fairly painless technical process. “It was pretty smooth, but there were issues,” he admits. “Sometimes sample‑rate issues, or if I happened to give someone an instrumental that was an MP3, that sometimes lines up differently than if you send them an actual WAV that’s bounced on the grid. So, sometimes I’d have to kinda eyeball things.\n\n“If there was trouble it started to be because of track counts. I probably only used 20 percent of what was actually recorded, ’cause we would try a lot of things, y’know. So, eventually the sessions got kinda crazy and you’d have to deactivate a lot of things and print things. But we got used to that.”\n\nKeeping Warm\nOn both folklore and evermore, Taylor Swift’s voice is very much front and centre and high in the mix, and generally sounds fairly dry. “I think the main thing was I wanted her vocals to have a more full range than maybe you typically hear,” Dessner explains. “’Cause I think a lot of the more pop‑oriented records are mixed a certain way and they take some of the warmth out of the vocal, so that it’s very bright and it kinda cuts really well on the radio. But she has this wonderful lower warmth frequency in her voice which is particularly important on a song like ‘seven’. If you carved out that mud, y’know, it wouldn’t hit you the same way. Or, like, ‘cardigan’, I think it needs that warmth, the kind of fuller feeling to it. It makes it darker, but to me that’s where a lot of emotion is.”\n\nEffects‑wise, almost all of the treatments were done in the box. “There’s no outboard reverbs printed,” says Dessner. “The only things that we did print would be like an [Eventide] H3000 or sometimes the [WEM] CopiCat tape delay for just a really subtle slap. But generally, it’s just different reverbs in the box that Jon was using. He uses the Valhalla stuff quite a bit and some other UAD reverbs, like the [Capitol] Chambers. I often just use Valhalla VintageVerb and the [Avid] Black Spring and simple things.”\n\nIn some instances, the final mix ended up being the never‑bettered rough mix, while other songs took far more work. “‘cardigan’ is basically the rough, as is ‘seven’. So, like the early, early mixes, when we didn’t even know we were mixing, we never were able to make it better. Like if you make it sound ‘good’, it might not be as good ’cause it loses some of its weird magic, y’know. But songs like ‘the last great american dynasty’ or ‘mad woman’, those songs were a little harder to create the dynamics the way you want them, and the pay‑off without going too far, and with also just keeping in the kind of aesthetic that we were in. Those were harder, I would say.\n\n“On evermore, I would say ‘willow’ was probably the hardest one to finish just because there were so many ways it could’ve gone. Eventually we settled back almost to the point where it began. So, there’s a lot of stuff that was left out of ‘willow’, just because the simplicity of the idea I think was in a way the strongest.”\n\nThe subject of this month’s Inside Track article, ‘willow’ was the first song written for evermore, immediately following the release of folklore. “It almost felt like a dare or something,” Dessner laughs. “We were writing, recording and mixing all in one kind of work stream and we went from one record to the other almost immediately. We were just sort off to the races. We didn’t really ever stop since April.”\n\nAaron Dessner: “One of the astonishing things about Taylor is what a brilliant songwriter she is and the clarity of her ideas and, when she has a story to tell, the way she can tell it.”\nRubber & Vinyl\nSometimes, Dessner and Swift drew inspiration from unlikely sources; ‘no body, no crime’, for instance, started when he gave her a ‘rubber bridge’ guitar made by Reuben Cox of the Old Style Guitar Shop in LA. “He’s my very old friend,” says Dessner of Cox. “He buys undervalued vintage guitars. Stuff that was made in the ‘50s and ‘60s as sort of learner guitars, like old Silvertones and Kays and Harmonys. These kinds of guitars which now are quite special, but they’re still not valued the same way that vintage Fenders or Gibsons are valued. Then, he customises them.\n\n“Recently he started retrofitting these guitars with a rubber bridge and flatwound strings. He’ll take, like, an acoustic Silvertone from 1958 and put a bridge on it that’s covered in this kind of rubber that deadens the strings, so it really has this kind of dead thrum to it. And he puts two pickups in there, one that’s more distorted and one that’s cleaner. They’re just incredible guitars. I thought Taylor would enjoy having one ’cause she loves the sound. So, I had Reuben make one for her and she used it to write ‘no body, no crime’.”\n\nAnother friend of Dessner’s, Ryan Olsen, has developed a piece of software called the Allovers Hi‑Hat Generator which helped create the unusual harmonic loops that feature on ‘marjorie’. “It’s not available on the market,” Dessner says of the software. “It’s just something that he uses personally, but I think hopefully eventually it’ll come out. I wouldn’t say it’s artificial intelligence software but there’s something very intelligent about it [laughs]. It basically analyses audio information and is able to separate audio into identifiable samples and then put them into a database. You then can design parameters for it to spit out sequences that are incredibly musical.\n\n“When Ryan comes here, he’ll just take all kinds of things that I give him and run it through there and then it’ll spit out, like, three hours of stuff. Then I go through it and find the layers that I love, then I loop them. You can hear it also on the song ‘happiness’, the drumming in the background. It’s not actually played. That’s drums that have been sampled and then re‑analysed and re‑sequenced out of this Allovers Hi‑Hat Generator.”\n\nThe song ‘marjorie’ is named after Swift’s opera‑singer grandmother and so, fittingly, her voice can be heard flitting in and out of the mix at the end of the track. “Taylor’s family gave us a bunch of recordings of her grandmother,” Dessner explains. “But they were from old, very scratchy, noisy vinyl. So, we had to denoise it all using [iZotope’s] RX and then I went in and I found some parts that I thought might work. I pitch‑shifted them into the key and then placed them. It took a while to find the right ones, but it’s really beautiful to be able to hear her. It’s just an incredibly special thing, I think.”\n\nMeet At The Pond\nTaylor Swift finally managed to get together with Aaron Dessner and Jack Antonoff in September 2020 for the filming of folklore: the long pond studio sessions, featuring the trio live‑performing the album. It also provided an opportunity for Swift to add her vocals to some of the evermore tracks.\n\nCabin Fever\n“It did allow us to have more fun, I think,” says Dessner. “Y’know, drink more wine and just kinda be in the same place and have the feeling of blasting the music here and dancing around and just enjoying ourselves. She’s really a lovely person to hang out with, so in that sense I’m glad that we had that chance to work together in person.\n\n“We were using a [Telefunken] U47 to record Taylor here,” he adds. “Either we were using one of the Siemens preamps on the board, which are amazing. Or I have Neve 1064s [preamps/EQs] and we use a Lisson Grove [AR‑1] tube compressor generally.”\n\nOne entirely new song, ‘tis the damn season’, came out of this face‑to‑face approach, which Swift wrote in the middle of the night after the team had stayed up late drinking. “We had a bunch of wine actually,” Dessner laughs, “and then everybody went to sleep, I thought. But I think she must have had this idea swimming around in her head, ’cause the next morning when she arrived, she sang ‘tis the damn season’ for me in my kitchen. It’s maybe my favourite song we’ve written together. Then she sang it at dinner for me and my wife Stine and we were all crying. It’s just that kind of song, so it was quite special.”\n\nNo Compromise\nfolklore and evermore have been both enormous critical and commercial successes for Taylor Swift. Aaron Dessner reckons that making these anti‑pop records has freed the singer up for the future. “I think it was very liberating for her,” he says. “I think that the thing that’s been probably the biggest change for her has just been being able to make songs without compromise and then release them without the promotional requirements that she’s used to from the past. Obviously, it comes at this time when we’re all in lockdown and nobody can tour or go on talk shows or anything. But I think for her, probably it will impact what she does in the future.\n\n“But I also think she can shapeshift again,” he concludes. “Who knows where she’ll go? She’s had many celebrated albums from the past, but to release two albums of this quality in such a short time, it really did shine a light on her songwriting talent and her storytelling ability and also just her willingness to experiment and collaborate. Somehow, I ended up in the middle of all that and I’m very grateful.”\n\nSoft Piano\nAaron Dessner’s characteristic dampened upright piano sound, familiar from the National’s albums, is much in evidence throughout both folklore and evermore. “The upright is a Yamaha U1 that I’ve had for more than a decade. Usually, I play it with the soft pedal down and that’s the sound of ‘hoax’ or ‘seven’ or ‘cardigan’, y’know, that felted sound. It kind of almost sounds like an electric piano.\n\n“I always mic it the same way, just with two [AKG] 414s, and they’re always the same distance off the wall. I had a studio in Brooklyn for 10 years and then when I moved here, I copied the same [wooden] pattern on the wall. And the reason I did that is ’cause of how much I love how this piano sounds bouncing off that wall. It just does something really special for the harmonics.”\n\nWhen on other folklore songs, such as ‘exile’ or ‘the 1’, where the piano was the main sonic feature of the track, Dessner played his Steinway grand. “A lot of times we use a pair of Coles [4038s] on the Steinway, just cause it’s darker. But sometimes we’ll have the 414s there as well and choose.”\n\nNational Unity\nOne key track on evermore, ‘coney island’, features all of the members of the National and sees Swift duetting with their singer Matt Berninger. “My brother [Bryce] actually originated that song,” says Aaron Dessner. “I sent him a reference at one point — I can’t remember what it was — and then he was sort of inspired to write that chord progression. Then we worked together to sort of develop it and I wrote a bunch of parts and we structured it.\n\n“Taylor and William Bowery [the songwriting pseudonym of Swift’s boyfriend, actor Joe Alwyn] wrote ‘coney island’ and she sang a beautiful version. It felt kind of done, actually. But then I think we all collectively thought — Taylor and myself and Bryce — like this was the closest to a National song.”\n\nDessner then asked the brothers who make up the National’s rhythm section, drummer Bryan and bassist Scott Devendorf, to play on ‘coney island’. Matt Berninger, as he often does with the band’s own tracks, recorded his vocal at home in Los Angeles. “It was never in the same place, it was done remotely,” says Dessner, “except Bryan was here at Long Pond when he played. It was great to collaborate as a band with Taylor.”",

Low is the engineer, mixer and general right‑hand man at Long Pond Studios in upstate New York, where he and Dessner spent most of 2020 working on folklore and evermore, with Swift in Los Angeles for much of the time.\n\n“In the beginning it did not feel real,” recalls Low. “There was this brand‑new collaboration, and it was amazing how quickly Aaron made these instrumental sketches and Taylor wrote lyrics and melodies to them, which she initially sent to us as iPhone voice memos. During our nightly family dinners in lockdown, Aaron would regularly pull up his phone and say, ‘Listen to this!’ and there would be another voice memo from Taylor with this beautiful song that she had written over a sketch of Aaron’s in a matter of hours. The rate at which it was happening was mind‑blowing. There was constant elevation, inspiration and just wanting to continue the momentum.\n\n“We put her voice memos straight into Pro Tools. They had tons of character, because of the weird phone compression and cutting midrange quality you just would not get when you put someone in front of a pristine recording chain. Plus there was all this bleed. It’s interesting how that dictates the attitude of the vocal and of the song. Even though none of the original voice memos ended up on the albums, they often gave us unexpected hints. These voice memos were such on‑a‑whim things, they were really telling. Taylor had certain phrasings and inflections that we often returned to later on. They became our reference points.”\n\nPond Life\nThe making of the National’s 2017 album Sleep Well Beast and the setup at Long Pond were covered in SOS October 2017; today the studio remains pretty much the same, with the exception of a new desk. “The main space is really big, and the console sits in the middle,” says Low. “In 2019, I installed a 1965 WSW/Siemens, which has 24 line‑in and microphone channels and another 24 line channels. WSW is the Austrian branch of Siemens usually built for broadcast. It’s loaded with 811510B channels. The build quality is insane, the switches and pots feel like they were made yesterday. To me it hints at the warm haze of a Class‑A Neve channel but sits further forward in the speakers. The midrange band on the passive EQ is a huge part of its charm, it really does feel like you’re changing the tone of the actual source rather than the recording. Most microphones go through the desk on their way into Pro Tools, though we sometimes use outboard Neve 1064 mic pres. Occasionally I use the Siemens to sum a mix.\n\n“We have a pair of ATC SCM45 monitors, which sound very clear in the large room. The ceiling is very high, and the front wall is about 25 feet behind the monitors. There are diffusers on the sidewalls and the back walls are absorbing, so there are very few reflections. Aaron and I will be listening in tons of different ways. I’ll listen in my home studio with similar ATC SCM20 monitors or on my ‘70s Marantz hi‑fi setup. Aaron is always checking things in his car, and if there’s something that is bugging him, I’ll join him in his car to find out what he hears.”\n\nThe WSW/Siemens console takes pride of place at Long Pond.

When lockdown started in Spring 2020, Low stacked up on supplies and “had a bunch of mixes lined up”. Meanwhile, on the West Coast, Swift had seen her Lover Fest tour cancelled. With help from engineer Laura Sisk, she set up a makeshift studio which she dubbed Kitty Committee in a bedroom in her Los Angeles home, and began working with long‑term producer and co‑writer Jack Antonoff. At the end of April, however, Swift also started working with Dessner, which took the project in a different direction. The impressionistic, atmospheric, electro‑folk instrumentals Dessner sent her were mostly composed and recorded by him at Long Pond, assisted by Low.\n\nSketching Sessions\n“The instrumental sketches Aaron makes come into being in different ways,” elaborates Low. “Sometimes they are more fleshed‑out ideas, sometimes they are less formed. But normally Aaron will set himself up in the studio, surrounded by instruments and synths, and he’ll construct a track. Once he feels it makes some kind of sense I’ll come in and take a listen and then we together develop what’s there.\n\n“I don’t call his sketches demos, because while many instruments are added and replaced later on, most of the original parts end up in the final version of the song. We try to get the sketches to a place where they are already very engaging as instrumental tracks. Aaron and I are always obsessively listening, because we constantly want to hear things that feel inspiring and musical, not just a bed of music in the background. It takes longer to create, but in this case also gave Taylor more to latch onto, both emotionally and in terms of musical inspiration. Hearing melodies woven in the music triggered new melodies.”\n\nNot long after Dessner and Low sent each sketch to Swift, they would receive her voice memos in return, and they’d load them into the Pro Tools session of the sketch in question. Dessner and Low then continued to develop the songs, in close collaboration with Swift. “Taylor’s voice memos often came with suggestions for how to edit the sketches: maybe throw in a bridge somewhere, shorten a section, change the chords or arrangement somewhere, and so on. Aaron would have similar ideas, and he then developed the arrangements, often with his brother Bryce, adding or replacing instruments. This happened fast, and became very interactive between us and Taylor, even though we were working remotely. When we added instruments, we were reacting to the way my rough mixes felt at the very beginning. Of course, it was also dictated by how Taylor wrote and sang to the tracks.”\n\nDessner supplied sketches for nine and produced 10 of folklore’s 16 songs, playing many different types of guitars, keyboards and synths as well as percusion and programmed drums. Instruments that were added later include live strings, drums, trombone, accordion, clarinet, harpsichord and more, with his brother Bryce doing many of the orchestrations. Most overdubs by other musicians were done remotely as well. Throughout, Low was keeping an overview of everything that was going on and mixing the material, so it was as presentable and inspiring as possible.\n\nMixing folklore\nAlthough Dessner has called folklore an “anti‑pop album”, the world’s number‑one pop mixer Serban Ghenea was drafted in to mix seven tracks, while Low did the remainder.\n\n“It was exciting to have Serban involved,” explains Low, “because he did things I’d never do or be able to do. The way the vocal sits always at the forefront, along with the clarity he gets in his mixes, is remarkable. A great example of this is on the song ‘epiphany’. There is so much beautiful space and the vocal feels effortlessly placed. It was really interesting to hear where he took things, because we were so close to the entire process in every way. Hearing a totally new perspective was eye‑opening and refreshing.\n\n“Throughout the entire process we were trying to maintain the original feel. Sometimes this was hard, because that initial rawness would get lost in large arrangements and additional layering. With revisions of folklore in particular we sometimes were losing the emotional weight from earlier more casual mixes. Because I was always mixing, there was also always the danger of over‑mixing.\n\n“We were trying to get the best of each mix version, and sometimes that meant stepping backwards, and grabbing a piano chain from an earlier mix, or going three versions back to before we added orchestration. There were definitely moments of thinking, ‘Is this going to compete sonically? Is this loud enough?’ We knew we loved the way the songs sounded as we were building them, so we stuck with what we knew. There were times where I tried to keep pushing a mix forward but it didn’t improve the song — ‘cardigan’ is an example of a song where we ended up choosing a very early mix.”\n\nOnward & Upward\nfolklore was finished and released in July 2020. In a normal world everyone might have gone on to do other things, but without the option of touring, they simply continued writing songs, with Low holding the fort. In September, many of the musicians who played on the album gathered at Long Pond for the shooting of a making‑of documentary, folklore: the long pond studio sessions, which is streamed on Disney+.\n\nThe temporary presence of Swift at Long Pond changed the working methods somewhat, as she could work with Dessner in the room, and Low was able record her vocals. After Swift left again, sessions continued until December, when evermore was released, with Dessner producing or co‑producing all tracks, apart from ‘gold rush’ which was co‑written and co‑produced by Swift and Antonoff. Low recorded many of Swift’s vocals for evermore, and mixed the entire album. The lead single ‘willow’ became the biggest hit from the album, reaching number one in the US and number three in the UK.\n\n“Before Taylor came to Long Pond,” remembers Low, “she had always recorded her vocals for folklore remotely in Los Angeles or Nashville. When I recorded, I used a modern Telefunken U47, which is our go‑to vocal mic — we record all the National stuff with that — going straight into the Siemens desk, and then into a Lisson Grove AR‑1 tube compressor, and via a Burl A‑D converter into Pro Tools. Taylor creates and lays down her vocal arrangements very quickly, and it sounds like a finished record in very few takes.”\n\n\nDevils In The Detail\nIn his mixes, Low wanted listeners to share his own initial response to these vocal performances. “The element that draws me in is always Taylor’s vocals. The first time I received files with her properly recorded but premixed vocals I was just floored. They sounded great, even with minimal EQ and compression. They were not the way I’m used to hearing her voice in her pop songs, with the vocal soaring and sitting at the very front edge of the soundscape. In these raw performances, I heard so much more intimacy and interaction with the music. It was wonderful to hear her voice with tons of detail and nuances in place: her phrasing, her tonality, her pitch, all very deliberate. We wanted to maintain that. It’s more emotional, and it sounds so much more personal to me. Then there was the music...”\n\nThe arrangements on evermore are even more ‘chamber pop’ than on folklore, with instruments like glockenspiel, crotales, flute, French horn, celeste and harmonium in evidence. “As listeners of the National may know, Aaron’s and Bryce’s arrangements can be quite dense. They love lush orchestration, all sorts of percusion, synths and other electronic sounds. The challenge was trying to get them to speak, without getting in the way of the vocals. I want a casual listener to be drawn in by the vocal, but sense that something special is happening in the music as well. At the same time, someone who really is digging in can fully immerse themselves and take in all the beauty deeper in the details of the sound and arrangement. Finding the balance between presenting all the musical elements that were happening in the arrangement and this really beautiful, upfront, real‑sounding vocal was the ticket.\n\n“A particular challenge is that a lot of the detail that Aaron gravitates towards happens in the low mids, which is a very warm part of our hearing spectrum that can quickly become too muddy or too woolly. A lot of the tonal and musical information lives in the low mids, and then the vocal sits more in the midrange and high mids. There’s not too much in the higher frequency range, except the top of the guitars, and some elements like a shaker and the higher buzzy parts of the synths. Maintaining clarity and separation in those often complex arrangements was a major challenge.”\n\nJonathan Low: I will use hardware when mixing in the box, though mainly just two units: the Eventide H3000, because I have not found any plug‑ins that do the same thing, and the [Thermionic] Culture Vulture, for its very broad tone shaping and distortion properties.\nIn & Out The Box\nAccording to Low, the final mix stage for evermore was “very short. There was a moment in the final week or so leading up to the release where the songs were developed far enough for me to sit down and try to make something very cohesive and final, finalising vocal volume, overall volume, and the vibe. There’s a point in every mix where the moves get really small. When a volume ride of 0.1dB makes a difference, you’re really close to being done. Earlier on, those little adjustments don’t really matter.\n\n“I often try to mix at the console, with some outboard on the two‑bus, but folklore was mixed all in the box, because we were working so fast, plus initially the plan was for the mixes to be done elsewhere. I ran a couple of mixes for evermore through the console, and ‘closure’ was the only one that stuck. It was summed through the Siemens, with an API 2500 compressor and a Thermionic Culture Phoenix and then back into Pro Tools via the Burl A‑D. I will use hardware when mixing in the box, though mainly just two units: the Eventide H3000, because I have not found any plug‑ins that do the same thing, and the [Thermionic] Culture Vulture, for its very broad tone shaping and distortion properties.\n\n“The writing and the production happened closely in conjunction with the engineering and mixing, and the arrangements were dense, making many of the sessions super hefty and actually quite messy. Sounds would constantly change roles in the arrangement and sometimes plug‑ins would just stack up. So final mixing involved cleaning up the sessions and stemming large groups down.”\n\nAcross The Rubber Bridge\nDownload the detailed view Pro Tools session screenshot:\nPackage icon insidetrack0321taylorswiftprotoolssession.jpg.zip\n\nThis composite screen capture shows the entire Pro Tools Edit window for ‘willow’.\nThis composite screen capture shows the entire Pro Tools Edit window for ‘willow’.\nThe Pro Tools mix session of ‘willow’ has close to 100 tracks, though there’s none of the elaborate busing that’s the hallmark of some modern sessions. At the top are six drum machine tracks in green from the Teenage Engineering OP‑1, an instrument that was used extensively on the album. Below that are five live percusion tracks (blue), three bass tracks (pink), and an ‘AUX Drums’ programming track. There’s a ‘rubber bridge’ guitar folder and aux, OP‑1 synth tracks, piano tracks, ‘Dream Machine’ (Josh Kaufman’s guitar) and E‑bow tracks, Yamaha, Sequential Prophet X, Moog and Roland Juno synth tracks, and Strings and Horns aux stem tracks.\n\n“Most of the drum tracks were performed on the OP‑1 by Aaron. These are not programmed tracks. Bryan Devendorf, drummer of the National, programmed some beats on a Roland TR‑8S. I ran those though the Fender Rumble bass amp, which adds some woofiness, like an acoustic kit room mic. There’s an acoustic shaker, and there’s an OP‑1 backbeat that’s subtle in the beginning, and then gets stronger towards the end of the song. I grouped all the drum elements and the bass, and sent those out to a hardware insert with the Culture Vulture, for saturation, so it got louder and more and more harmonically rich. There is this subtle growing and crescendo of intensity of the rhythm section by the end.\n\n“The ‘rubber bridge’ guitars were the main anchor in the instruments. These guitars have a wooden bridge wrapped in rubber, and sound a bit like a nylon‑string guitar, or a light palm mute. They’re very percusive and sound best when recorded on our Neumann U47 and a DI. On many of those DI tracks I have a [SPL] Transient Designer to lower the sustain and keep them punchy, especially in the low end. There’s a folder with five takes of ‘rubber bridge’ guitar in this session, creating this wall of unique guitar sound.\n\nThis lengthy chain of plug‑ins was used to process the ‘rubber bridge’ guitars.\nThis lengthy chain of plug‑ins was used to process the ‘rubber bridge’ guitars.\n\n“I treated the ‘rubber bridge’ guitars quite extensively. There’s a FabFilter Pro‑Q3 cutting some midrange frequencies and some air around 10kHz. These guitars can splash out in the high end and have a boominess that’s in the same range as the low end of Taylor’s vocal, so I had to keep these things under control. Then I used a SoundToys Tremolator, with a quarter‑note tremolo that makes the accents in the playing a bit more apparent. I like to get the acoustic guitars a little bit out of the way for the less important beats, so I have the Massey CT5 compressor side‑chained to the kick drum. I also used the UAD Precision K‑Stereo to make the guitars a bit wider. The iZotope Ozone Exciter adds some high mids and high‑end harmonic saturation sparkly stuff, and the SoundToys EchoBoy delay is automated, with it only coming on in the bridge, where I wanted more ambience.”\n\nGrowing Pains\n“Once we had figured out how to sit the ‘rubber bridge’ guitars in the mix, the next challenge was to work out the end of the song, after the bridge. Taylor actually goes down an octave with her voice in the last chorus, and at the same time the music continues to push and grow. That meant using a lot of automation and Clip Gain adjustment to make sure the vocal always stayed on top. There also are ambient pianos playing counter‑melodies, and balancing the vocals, guitars and pianos was the main focus on this song. We spent a lot of time balancing this, particularly as the track grows towards the end.\n\n“The vocal tracks share many of the same plug‑ins and settings. On the main lead vocal track I added the UAD Pultec EQP‑1A, with a little bit of a cut in the low end at 30Hz, and a boost at 8kHz, which adds some modern air. The second plug‑in is the Oeksound Soothe, which is just touching the vocal, and it helps with any harsh resonance stuff in the high mids, and a little in the lower mids. Next is the UAD 1176AE, and then the FabFilter Pro‑Q3, doing some notches at 200Hz, 1kHz, 4kHz and close to 10kHz. I tend to do subtractive EQ on the Q3, and use more analogue‑sounding plug‑ins, like the Pultec or the Maag, to boost. After that is the FabFilter Pro‑DS [de‑esser], taking off a couple of decibels, followed by the FabFilter Saturn 2 [saturation processor], on a warm tape setting.\n\nTaylor Swift’s vocal went through a number of plug‑ins, though most were not making radical changes to the sound.\nTaylor Swift’s vocal went through a number of plug‑ins, though most were not making radical changes to the sound.\n\n“Below the vocal tracks are three aux effects tracks, for the vocals. ‘Long Delay’ has a stereo EchoBoy going into an Altiverb with a spring reverb, for effect throws in the choruses. ‘Chamber’ is the UAD Capitol Chamber, which gives the vocal a nice density and size, without it being a long reverb. The ‘Plate’ aux is the UAD EMT140, for the longer tail. These two reverbs work in conjunction, with the chamber for the upfront space determining where the vocal sits in the mix, and the plate more for the depth behind that.\n\n“At the bottom of the session is a two‑bus aux, which mimics the way I do the two‑bus on the desk. The plug‑ins are the UAD Massive Passive EQ, UAD API 2500 compressor, and the UAD Ampex ATR102. Depending on the song, I will choose 15ips or 30ips. In this case it was set to 15ips, half‑inch GP9. That has a nice, aggressive, midrange push, and the GP9 bottom end goes that little bit lower. There’s also a PSP Vintage Warmer, a Sonnox Oxford Inflator, plus a FabFilter Pro‑L2 [limiter]. None of these things are doing very much on their own, but in conjunction give me the interaction I expect from an analogue mix chain.”\n\nThe Low Down\n“I’m originally from Philadelphia,” says Jonathan Low, “and played piano, alto saxophone and guitar when growing up. My dad is an electrical engineer and audiophile hobbyist, and I learned a lot about circuit design and how to repair things. I then started building guitar pedals and guitar amps, and recorded bands at my high school using a minidisc player and some binaural microphones. After that I did a music industry programme at Drexel University, and spent a lot of time working at the recording facilities there.\n\n“This led to me meeting Brian McTear, a producer and owner of Miner Street Studios, which became my home base from 2009 to 2014. I learned a lot from him, from developing an interest in creating sounds in untraditional ways, to how to see a record through to completion. The studio has a two‑inch 16‑track Ampex MM1200 tape machine and a beautiful MCI 400 console which very quickly shaped the way I think about routing and signal flow. I’m lucky to have learned this way, because a computer environment is like the Wild West: there are no rules in terms of how to get from point A to point B. This flexibility is incredible, but sometimes there are simply too many options.\n\n“I met Aaron [Dessner] because singer‑songwriter Sharon van Etten recorded her second album, Epic [2010] at Miner Street, with Brian producing. Her third album, Tramp [2012] was produced by Aaron. They came to Philly to record drums and I ended up mixing a bunch of that record. After that I would occasionally go to work in Aaron’s garage studio in Brooklyn, and this became more and more a regular collaboration. I then moved from Philly up to the Hudson Valley to help Aaron build Long Pond. We first used the studio in the spring of 2016, when beginning to record the National’s album Sleep Well Beast.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift’s ‘Fearless’: How She Made Her Pop Breakthrough\nWith her second album in 2008, Swift’s music started getting more personal — and much more popular\nBy Jonathan Bernstein \n\nTaylor Swift is re-recording her first six albums as a way of reasserting control over her master recordings. First up is Fearless: Taylor’s Version, due out April 9th — a new recording of the 2008 album that set her on a course to being one of the biggest pop acts of her generation. In this story, originally published in 2018, we spoke with the people who helped Swift make that breakthrough.\n\nTaylor Swift spent the year following the release of her 2006 debut on the road as the opening act for country stars like George Strait, Tim McGraw, and Faith Hill. Her relentless new touring schedule left her alone for long periods of time. After spending several years in Nashville co-writing sessions, she suddenly found herself seizing the chance to create on her own. “If you’re in Arkansas, who’s there to write with?” she said.\n\nThe album that eventually came out of this process — including “Love Story” and “You Belong With Me,” her first two Top 10 crossover pop hits — would introduce Swift to the pop mainstream. But when sessions first began, Swift was simply trying to build off her trailblazing debut. “There was definitely an unwritten stress,” says studio engineer Chad Carlson. “We knew we could make a monster record, but we put a lot of pressure in ourselves.”\n\nOne of Swift and producer Nathan Chapman’s reference points for the album’s sound was the bright 2007 hit “Bubbly,” by Colbie Caillat, who would end up co-writing and guesting on the Fearless track “Breathe.” “There was a certain honesty and commitment to keeping the arrangements simple that that record had,” says Justin Niebank, who mixed Fearless. “Taylor and Nathan loved the fact that on ‘Bubbly’ you could really sense that it was just an honest person sitting in a room surrounded by musicians.”\n\nSwift, who co-produced the album, worked on Fearless throughout 2006 and 2007, in short spurts during time off between touring — this time, with a newfound focus on de-emphasizing country signifiers. “We wrote ‘You Belong With Me’ in one or two hours,” said Liz Rose. “When she’s writing something, she’s already producing in her head.” Ultimately, it was Swift’s rapidly progressing, increasingly personal songwriting that made Fearless feel pivotal, as heard on songs like the empathetic “Fifteen” and the downcast “White Horse.”\n\n“When I knew something was going on in someone’s personal life and they didn’t address it in their music, I was always very confused by that,” Swift said at the time. “I owe it to people from letting them in from Day One.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "I have this idea,” Taylor Swift says near the end of Miss Americana, director Lana Wilson’s documentary about the singer’s life and career. Moments later, casually holding her iPhone and reclining on a sofa in her studio, Swift performs the chorus for what will become “Only the Young,” sounding as if she’s reciting an old favorite rather than something new. Swift tells Vanity Fair via email:\n\n“This particular song, and the process of creating it, was a perfect example of how visceral writing a song can be. With songwriting, you try to transport yourself back to a time you felt intense emotion and write from that place. Every once in a blue moon, you end up in the studio at the exact moment you’re feeling that raw emotion.”\nThat kind of passion is present throughout Miss Americana. Rather than opt for mere hagiography to further buttress the Swift myth, Wilson focused on the singer during a transitional phase, as she wrapped up her Reputation tour and began creating her 2019 album, Lover. Through it all, Wilson captures Swift in not just confessional interviews, but in the recording studio as well. \n\n“It was the hardest thing to get access to - which is saying something, I think, because there’s obviously so many emotional and raw moments in the film,” the director says. “Filming her writing songs in the studio took the longest - to get the trust to film that - because the studio and writing songs is Taylor’s happy place.”\n“Only the Young” was written in 2018, shortly after Swift had broken her long silence about politics. She had endorsed Democratic candidate Phil Bredesen in the Tennessee Senate race against Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn. But though Swift was credited with inspiring a surge in voter registration, Blackburn emerged as the winner. Miss Americana captures Swift’s devastation vividly. Upon hearing the news, she expresses her disgust with Blackburn by describing her as “Trump in a wig.”\n\n“Almost the entire process of creating that song, I was fighting back tears because I was so sad about the results of the midterm elections in my state and the losses faced by superb Democratic candidates in states like Georgia and Texas. I didn’t want the defeat and hopelessness I felt for our country’s future to get the best of me. I didn’t want to weep. I wanted to have hope. Writing ‘Only the Young’ helped me push through that moment in my life and gave me the hope to keep fighting for what I believe is right.”\nThe act of songwriting has long had an undeniable cinematic appeal. The difference, however, is this film wasn’t a narrative features. Miss Americana is a work of nonfiction.\n\n“It’s the kind of thing you always hope for when you’re making a film, but it’s never guaranteed that that kind of magic will happen in front of you, in front of the camera,” Wilson says of recording the creation of “Only the Young.” “I remember leaving the room at the end of that night and feeling like, This is why I do what I do.”\nSwift wrote the song to motivate young people, but Wilson sees power in the songwriting process itself: \n\n“The best feedback I’ve got has been from young kids starting to make art for the first time and not being afraid of it because they’ve seen an example of it in front of their eyes.”\nNine turbulent months after Swift released “Only the Young,” she gave gratis license for it to be used in a voter-turnout video from California congressman Eric Swalwell. The video blended a year’s worth of headlines, including the global pandemic and mass protests for social justice, with her song and words from a speech by Kamala Harris. \n\n“As a country musician, I was always told it’s better to stay out of [politics]. The Trump presidency forced me to lean in and educate myself. I found myself talking about government and the presidency and policy with my boyfriend [actor Joe Alwyn], who supported me in speaking out. I started talking to my family and friends about politics and learning as much as I could about where I stand. I’m proud to have moved past fear and self-doubt, and to endorse and support leadership that moves us beyond this divisive, heartbreaking moment in time.”\nThis year, the Oscars could provide one more twist in the song’s journey, but the singer is not ready to talk too much about what would be her first nomination from the Academy. Even global superstars get superstitious, it turns out. \n\n“It would mean a great deal to me, especially since ‘Only the Young’ immortalizes such a pivotal moment in my life and our country’s mobilization to move together toward change. I would be incredibly honored to be included. But I am absolutely terrified to go further into the daydream for fear of jinxing it.”  ",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Shares the Advice She'd Give Her Younger Self Ahead of 2021 GRAMMYs (Exclusive)\nET spoke with the singer during a break from GRAMMY rehearsals this week.\nIt's been 13 years since Taylor Swift earned her first-ever GRAMMY nomination, for Best New Artist.\n\nAlthough she didn't take home that trophy in 2008 (the accolade went to Amy Winehouse), the singer has racked up a number of impressive GRAMMY wins over the years, including two for Album of the Year -- Fearless and 1989 -- and Best Music Video for \"Bad Blood.\" Now, at age 31, Swift is up for six more GRAMMYs, including Album of the Year for Folklore (which she wrote and released last year amid the coronavirus pandemic) and Song of the Year for \"Cardigan,\" at the upcoming ceremony on Sunday.\n\nAhead of show day, ET spoke with Swift about what it's like to be re-recording her songs on the 13th anniversary of her first nomination. She also reflected on her career, sharing the advice she'd give her younger self, knowing what she knows now.\n\n\"It's pretty wild how much time has passed since my first GRAMMY nomination. I still feel pretty lucky to still be a part of this night,\" Swift told ET's Keltie Knight, during a break from rehearsals this week. \"I think the advice I would give myself when I was younger is probably to, when things get hard, always focus in on how much I love music.\"\n\n\"That has been the thing that, no matter what, has protected me from any of the other outside things that have made me feel strange,\" she continued. \"I've never had a problem with the general fact of making music or playing music. I've never stopped loving it. It's been the outside stuff that has made me feel down at times.\"\n\nSwift said there are two things in particular that have helped protect her over the course of her career: 1.) enthusiasm and 2.) how much she loves music.\n\n\"As soon as you fail, enthusiasm tells you that the next great idea is around the corner,\" she explained. \"And your love of music will always center you, if you’re doing this for that, and that alone, because that is hard to take away.\"\n\n\"People can reduce and criticize other elements,\" she added. \"It sounds really, really simple, but loving the actual making of music and the playing of music is what I think has really helped me balance things.\"\n\nIn addition to her GRAMMY nominations, Swift will also be taking the stage Sunday night to perform a few of her hits.\n\n\"One thing I can tell you about my GRAMMY performance that's not highly confidential is that my GRAMMY performance includes my collaborators Aaron Dessner and Jack Antonoff,\" she teased during a CBS News appearance. \"Which is really exciting, because this has been an adventure that the three of us have gone on since the very beginning of quarantine and lockdown.\"\n\nBen Winston, executive producer of the GRAMMY Awards, also talked to ET this week about what fans can expect from Swift's much-anticipated return to the GRAMMYs stage.\n\n\"It's an amazing performance. It's genuinely like, magical. I was grinning ear to ear,\" he said, shortly after watching Swift rehearse. \"Her and her team have got the most ambitious concept for her performance, but it's brilliant and it's beautiful and I think it's gonna be one of the moments of the night, no doubt.\"",

      "Transcript/Content": "[My Transcript] Hi, I'm Liz Rose, and today we're talking about \"White Horse\" by Taylor Swift. I think if you'd never heard the song \"White Horse\" before, I would describe it to you as every young teenage girl's dream song of everything she ever wished from a boy. Taylor just, she just has this way of describing her feelings and painting this picture, and it was so amazing to help paint that picture. \nI was actually introduced to Taylor at a writer's round, and they wanted me to sing a couple of songs, and she was there and just walked up to me and said, \"I love your songs, and I was wondering if you would write with me sometime.\" And she kinda knocked me off my feet. (chuckling)\nShe was like, \"I've got this idea, and here's this melody.\" And she started playing it, and I'll never forget feeling so foolish. Like, she did not need me. When we wrote it, she came to the table with the beginning of the song. The- ♪ Say your sorry / that face of angel comes out just when you need it to ♪. Our co-writing situation was so different, because it was such a team.\nIt was such a volley back and forth, and it was always so fast. Everything that we wrote, we probably never spent more than hour and a half on.\nIt always just flowed, because she trusted me. And I trusted her. I trusted her to know what she wanted to say, and know what her future fans would wanna hear, and I was very careful to let Taylor say that Taylor would say.\nThat was a song written during the beginnings of the first record for the second record, and that was the beautiful thing about Taylor is that Taylor never stopped writing songs. When \"White Horse\" was done, I loved it. I thought it was a great song, and I loved it so much. She was just putting out the first Taylor Swift album, so I always knew that anything that I wrote with Taylor was a Taylor song. So you didn't go out and pitch it.\nYou just calmly sat back and waited, and watched things come together. Believe it or not, I was picking up dog poop when someone called me and said, \"Guess what? You have two Grammy nominations.\" I'll never forget that as long as I live. I was like, what? Well, that's cool. You know? (laughing) I swear. And it was so awesome when we won the Grammy, because Taylor was so sweet to say, \"If we win, I want you to talk.\"\nThe beautiful thing to me about \"White Horse\" is that it speaks to young people, but it also speaks to almost any age. That's what was always so amazing to me about that song is that you can be 12, or 13, or 16, or 30, or 50, and that song \"White Horse\" will still speak to you. You'll still get it.",

I think she's good and we're gonna sign her. I want you to consider getting with her, and showing her the ropes and all this stuff.\" He was gonna play something for me, he gave me a picture and and I was like, \"How old is she?\" He says whatever she was at the tim, fourteen or fifteen. It turns out it was Taylor Swift and I passed. I passed. I said, \"I don't know. I just don't know if I have anything to ?, I don't think I could do that.\" And the truth is I was right. I remember kids always said, \"Dad, you screwed up!\" And man, what are you doing? None of my songs would have made her records anyway. She knows what she's doing, she knows her audience, she knows who she is. And I would have gone in there and tried to bully her. And now you can't say that. You gotta do you know whatever.",

We kept all the same parts that I initially dreamed up for these songs. But if there was any way that we could improve upon the sonic quality, we did.\"\n\n\"We just kind of took all the knowledge that we've acquired over decades of playing this music and applied that to it,\" she adds. \"But yeah, I did go in line by line and listen to every single vocal and think, you know, what are my inflections here. If I can improve upon it, I did. But I really did want this to be very true to what I initially thought of and what I had initially written. But better. Obviously.\"\n\nOn Friday, Swift released the first re-recording of her six albums with her previous label Big Machine Group. The new album's version includes six never-before-released tracks that Swift wrote during the same time but were scrapped from the original album.\n\nThe day before release, Swift shared snippets of five of her tracks through several outlets, including the album's title track \"Fearless\" on Good Morning America. From the new album, Swift had already released \"Love Story (Taylor's Version)\" and two \"From the Vault\" tracks, \"You All Over Me\" and \"Mr. Perfectly Fine.\"\n\n\"I'm so ecstatic that my album Fearless (Taylor's Version) will be out tonight. It's crazy that it's finally here,\" she said on the morning show.\n\nIn November 2020, Swift was legally allowed to re-record her first five albums, which Scooter Braun gained ownership of last year following his $330 million deal with Big Machine Label Group. Swift previously spoke out after Braun sold her masters to a company called Shamrock Holdings for $300 million.\n\nSince leaving Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records and Universal Music Group in an agreement to own the rights to her music going forward. In 2019, she released Lover, followed by her two pandemic albums folklore and evermore in 2020.",

After recently dropping Fearless (Taylor's Version) — a re-recording of the hit album with six never-before-released tracks — the newly-released album debuted at No. 1 as well, becoming her ninth album to do so, according to Billboard.\n\nAdditionally, the outlet reports that this is the biggest week for an album so far in 2021 as Fearless (Taylor's Version) is the only re-recorded album in history to reach No. 1.\n\nSwift, 31, is also the first woman to release three new No. 1 albums in under a year, with Folklore, Evermore and Fearless (Taylor's Version) spanning eight months and two weeks, per Billboard.\n\nReacting to Fearless (Taylor's Version) reaching its chart-topping status, Swift took a minute to thank fans on Twitter and also shared that she's busy on the next re-recording. \"Been in the studio all day recording the next one - it's really so amazing what you all have done here,\" she wrote.\n\nTaylor Swift Releases Fearless (Taylor's Version): Breaking Down All 6 New Songs from the Vault\n\nWant to get the biggest stories from PEOPLE every weekday?

The popstar is currently remaking all of her past albums up to 2017’s ‘Reputation’ after the rights to the records were sold by her former record label Big Machine without her permission.\n\n\n‘Fearless (Taylor’s Version)’ was released worldwide on April 9. In a four-star review, NME said the new album “both celebrates and stays true to Swift’s ‘Fearless’-era.”\n\nIn a recent interview, Swift said of the album’s re-recording process: “We really did go in and try to create a ‘the same but better’ version. We kept all the same parts that I initially dreamed up for these songs. But if there was any way that we could improve upon the sonic quality, we did.”",

There is a boundless enthusiasm in the way Jack makes music, and it’s an absolutely irresistible quality to find in a collaborator. The excitement he exudes in the studio is just so contagious, and he never seems overworked because he genuinely, hopelessly, deeply loves what he’s doing.”\n\n‘Holy S–t’ Moments: Antonoff On Three Memorable Creative Breakthroughs\n1. On one of my favorite songs on [Swift’s] folklore, “The Lakes,” there was this big orchestral version, and Taylor was like, “Eh, make it small.” I had gotten lost in the string arrangements and all this stuff, and I took everything out. I was just like, “Oh, my God!” We were not together because that record was made [remotely], but I remember being in the studio alone like, “Holy s–t, this is so perfect.”",

During this time where most of us hunkered down and watched Netflix, you produced not one, but two surprise albums with Taylor Swift. Prior to this you were already an acclaimed producer, but what did it give you to work with a name like Taylor Swift? During a pandemic even?\n\n[Aaron]: I never expected that to happen. I was sitting at dinner one night in upstate New York where my wife Stine and I live with our kids, then I got a text from Taylor saying “would you ever consider collaborating remotely?” And then I sent her music and it happened really quickly, we just wrote, and wrote and wrote, and suddenly we finished folklore and then evermore. I never expected anything like that to happen, but I realize looking back, that maybe I had been preparing myself because of the way that I work. I often work by myself and I have a studio at home, and we live in the countryside, and in a way we were well-suited or situated to be in a situation where we were isolated and I could work remotely. Finally The National wasn’t on tour because we’d toured off and on for 20 years, and suddenly being at home and not having to go somewhere I realized could be more prolific and create a lot of music. It was a wild year and a half.\n\n[Andy]: Besides your work with Swift, you’ve produced more than a dozen albums, including for The National, Frightened Rabbit and Ben Howard. How does your role as a producer change from project to project? How do you approach each album differently?\n\n[Aaron]: Well sometimes I have a sound in my head, or kind of an aesthetic that I pursue. But really I just think it’s doing what’s right for the song. Each artist is so different, and I feel like I’m learning as much from them as they’re learning or maybe benefiting from working with me. But I don’t know, I think it’s a mystery every time you start a new project. Something changes or you change or there’s new processes. I guess I like to make a lot of music without really being critical of it, and sort of just go through the process, and then once you get to a certain point, to look and take a birds-eye view of it and see where you are and you can be critical. I’ve been lucky to be able to evolve as a musician and I feel like part of that is just working with a lot of different artists. They all come from a different place and all have a different way of relating to music, so you learn from them as much as they maybe learn from me.\n\n[Andy]: Big Red Machine began as a collaboration between you and Justin Vernon. I’ve sometimes seen it described more as collaborative project rather than a band given the nature of your work. How would you characterize the music you make with Big Red Machine as opposed to your other projects?\n\n[Aaron]: Well I think Big Red Machine is… A Justin Vernon, who, you know, people know him as Bon Iver but he’s an old very close friend of mine, and we’ve often collaborated. I think Big Red Machine for us is almost like a… a laboratory or something where we can experiment without the pressure of our main projects. The National and Bon Iver are bands that everyone knows, and those bands change and evolve, but maybe it’s easier sometimes in a project like Big Red Machine… That is more open-ended or almost like a laboratory with the windows and doors are all open and anybody can fly in, or anybody can collaborate. It’s very free, it’s freeing in a way as an artist to have something where you can work without expectations. We’ve made some of our favorite music for this project. It definitely just started as something for us to while were hanging out, just as friends. I think the best music I have made is when you really don’t know it’s for and it’s just kinda making stuff. So that’s kind of how it started.\n\n \n\n[Andy]: Yeah, I also think there’s something to add to that with songs like “Dorothea” and “Closure” which were actually Big Red Machine songs, right? Until they made it onto evermore?\n\n \n\n[Aaron]: You know, when we were making evermore… Taylor had heard all the new Big Red Machine music, and she’s a fan of the first album, and I think… She wanted to write something for Big Red Machine, so those, you know that music, was maybe gonna be part of Big Red Machine, but then it made more sense as part of evermore. But after we finished evermore, Taylor and I wrote ‘Renegade’ for Big Red Machine, and she also joined Justin on the song ‘Birch’. In a way she just felt like part of the crew or part of the band or something. That’s the nature of when you’re working on stuff, most of the people on this Big Red Machine album are people I’ve produced records for or are close friends with. It becomes sort of a family, and everybody is making it work together, exchanging ideas… So she was just very much excited to participate.\n\n \n\n[Andy]: Right, and I think that’s one of the cool things in following you as an artist and a producer. Listening to how your music intertwines. Like I heard the song you made for Bob’s Burgers actually made it into evermore, I actually think it was the instrumental for ‘Dorothea’.\n\n \n\n[Aaron]: Yeah that actually funny that you mention it, it was kind of an accident! I didn’t know that Matt Berninger from The National had used that music. I only realized it after somebody pointed it out. But yeah, that is funny and I think I write music, a lot of music, not really knowing what it’s for and share it with friends and it ends up as different things. The lines between a National song or a Big Red Machine song or other things sometimes get blurry.\n\n \n\n[Andy]: Right, right. And I suppose that’s the hallmark of a good producer. [chuckles]\n\n \n\n[Aaron]: Hopefully it’s a good hallmark! [laughs] The main thing is that I make music from an emotional place and I try to make music that I personally would wanna listen to, even before there’s a vocal melody or a song written to it. It’s sort of, almost, an emotional outlet for me and I just make this music and it’s exciting to see where it ends up.\n\n \n\n[Andy]: Right, see where it fits.\n\n \n\n[Aaron] Yup!\n\n \n\n[Andy]: So in this big music laboratory that Big Red Machine is, how do you choose which artists your wanna collaborate with when making music?\n\n \n\n[Aaron]: I think Justin describes it as I’m the pilot and he’s my wingman or my co-pilot and we just… Over the last three years we’ve been making a lot of these ideas. I usually start all the music and then he would bounce off of it. But I think over time, one important thing is that we wanted it to be a community of voices who, not just his voice or my voice, we wanted it to be almost like a book with different chapters and different characters and they interweave. So maybe the themes are related in the music feels very cohesive, but there’s different voices. A lot of the people that ended up singing on this record are people that are either ones where I’ve produced their records and we’ve become close friends, so like Sharon Van Etten, Ben Howard, Taylor Swift, Kate Stables, Lisa Hannigan. These artists who I’ve worked with before and kind of understand the nature of their voices and that’s easy often for me to reach out. And then there’s other singers where we had finished something and we just thought, ‘oh what if we had Naeem on Easy To Sabotage’, so he wrote his verse after the song already kind of existed. Or there’s this amazing singer from LA, Ilsey, she writes a lot for different big artists, but she has this really cool interesting voice, so she joined us on a song. It’s really just like anything is possible with this project because it doesn’t need to fit into a tiny little box. So I think that’s what’s fun for us.\n\n \n\n[Andy]: Yeah, and that must really give an artistic freedom, in some sense?\n\n \n\n[Aaron]: It does. I think you… You know, when you’ve been making music for as long as I have, because now I’m in my mid-40’s and I have been making records since I was 16 or 17. Something like this where it can change, you can different kinds of songs sitting next to each other, I think it’s interesting and it’s unlike a record certainly that I’ve made or heard before. It’s not a band, it’s not a super-group, it’s some weird combination of those things. It’s fun to see how different songwriters react to different music or my music coming from, maybe it’s a similar place emotionally, but everyone has a different reaction.\n\n \n\n[Andy]: Speaking of singers, there’s a wide variety of singers on “How Long Do You Think It’s Gonna Last”, including, for the first time, you on the lead vocal. We’ve been hearing you on backing before, but on this album you’re singing on “Magnolia”, “Brycie” and on “The Ghost Of Cincinnati.” What prompted you to sing on this record, and how was your experience being in front of the microphone, not behind it?\n\n \n\n[Aaron]: Well yeah, I mean the truth is whenever I write music I’m always singing to myself or under my breath. I can sing obviously, but because I’ve been in a band for so long with Matt Berninger who in The National has had such a big charismatic voice, and I love what he brings to it. Or working with Justin Vernon or Taylor Swift or any of these people that have these special well-known voices. I have obviously not been eager to step out into that role. I think what happened was I finished the song “Brycie” which is really almost like a love-letter to my twin brother for looking after me when we were younger. When I was in high school I was depressed and he made sure I didn’t fall through the cracks. I wrote that song and played it for Justin, and he was really moved by it. He was really pushing me to make that a Big Red Machine song, and I also sent it to Taylor and she also felt like this is beautiful, like ‘why are you hiding your voice?’ was the question she asked. I thought about it, and we just started. Not long after, Justin he invited me to open the next Bon Iver tour, the arena tour he was gonna do in Europe which actually has been cancelled and rescheduled a few times, because of the pandemic. He wanted me to open for him in these spaces by myself. I’ve never played a solo show like that, but he, knowing how I work and the music I’ve been making, I think he thought it would be interesting. That kind of just accelerated the process where I started to finish songs by myself and I was writing a ton of music, and I was singing more, actually finishing songs and melodies and really liking what I was doing. Justin was giving me so much encouragement, and he just kept saying ‘keep going, this is the interesting time where you really don’t know what you’re doing or you’re sort of discovering your voice’. Obviously I’m an accomplished musician, but I’m not known for my voice. It was interesting. Then we included some of these songs on the Big Red Machine record. I think it does make sense. It connects it all, I guess, to hear the person that’s making the music actually sing also.\n\n \n\n[Andy]: It does, and as a long time fan of you it’s really a pleasure hearing your vocal on a track like “The Ghost Of Cincinnati”.\n\n \n\n[Aaron]: Thank you! That was actually a song that I didn’t even know… I didn’t really write it for Big Red Machine, but I finished it, and it’s just me playing the guitar and singing, and I played it for Taylor actually when I was in L.A for the Grammys. She was the one who was like ‘this should be on the Big Red Machine record’, even though it is different stylistically, it kind of makes a lot of sense. So we put that on and there’s other songs like “Mimi” or “Hoping Then” where I sing with Justin, or we trade vocals and that is also kind of interesting. I’m lucky that I had a lot of encouragement and I think that’s also what I try to do for other artists. Really be supportive of the vulnerable moment when you… Anytime you have any idea no matter how much music you’ve made, anytime you present something, it’s like a vulnerable moment, like ‘is anyone gonna like this?’ [laughs] So I appreciate all the support I’ve had.\n\n \n\n[Andy]: Well of course! In previous interviews, you’ve mentioned that this album touches upon themes such as childhood, family dynamics and mental health. Looking at the album cover, it depicts you, your twin brother Bryce and your sister Jessica visiting your grandmother in the 80’s. It really highlights the family aspect. How did the theme of family find its way to this album?\n\n \n\n[Aaron]: Well I think it started with that song that I wrote for my brother, Bryce, the song “Brycie”. But then I think we realized that a lot the songs were touching on childhood and looking back at your life and searching for remedies or a time before you’ve lost your innocence or before you’ve made mistakes or lost people or hurt people or been hurt. Maybe it’s my age or something as you get older you see families disintegrate, marriages disintegrate or friendships end. It’s the wreckage of life… when you think about it, you search for a time before all of that. Music for me, I guess, is this emotional outlet and therapy. Maybe it was just what I was writing about or thinking about. I think Justin was also thinking about that, and then Anaïs Mitchell who is this incredible folksinger who joins us on the song “Latter Days” and also on “New Auburn”, she heard the song “Brycie” and she wrote the words to those two songs, and they’re very connected. That’s where you get the album title, “How long do you think it’s gonna last”. Maybe we were all just thinking about, as adults now, thinking about when you first discover the joy of making music, you’re usually a kid. Maybe we’re all realizing that Big Red Machine is a way to re-discover that, also in term of the themes in the songs, it’s looking back at your childhood or your life. Being reflective.\n\n \n\n[Andy]: Right. I think there’s a profoundly beautiful point about that. It correlates well with another prevalent theme of the album, which I can gather is mental health. It’s something you’ve talked openly about in The Long Pond Sessions, and it’s represented through songs such as “Renegade” and the tribute to the late and great Scott Hutchison on the song “Hutch”. Why is the subject of mental health important for you to address artistically?\n\n \n\n[Aaron]: In general I think mental health doesn’t get enough attention, or you could never put too much attention on it. Because if you break your leg or if you have the flu, or if you cut yourself you go to the hospital and get help. Whereas when you’re struggling mentally, I think there’s still this stigma in terms of getting help and reaching out and telling someone that you are having bad thoughts or that you’re in a dark place. I’ve had that tendency in my life, to struggle with depression. I’m always scared of it. Even when I’m in a good place. There’s a feeling that you could very easily go into a tailspin if you don’t take care of yourself, don’t exercise, don’t focus on having a healthy life. For me it’s just… I’ve also lost friends to depression, including Scott, I produced the last Frightened Rabbit record and Frightened Rabbit had been a band that had opened for The National for many years, and they were good friends and I really respected him as an artist, but he struggled with depression. Eventually he succumbed to it. Like many of his friends or his band-mates, I’m haunted by the feeling of ‘did I not pay enough attention to his depression?’ or ask enough questions, and sort of check in enough. It’s something that I feel is very important. I’m not disadvantaged in any way, I have a good life and I’ve never really struggled with… I don’t have big issues that haunt me, but that doesn’t mean I can’t sometimes feel depressed. It can come on like a flu or something. I think it’s just important to open about it, and I think music is one way to be open about it for me anyways.\n\n \n\n[Andy]: Right. In a quick personal side-note – after The Long Pond Sessions was released, I saw numerous threads on the internet talking about how inspiring you were as a positive role model for men to talk openly about mental health. So I also just wanna add to that and say thank you for being that.\n\n \n\n[Aaron]: Thank you, I appreciate that! It’s funny, I don’t think I realized how many people would see that film, although I should’ve realized it. But I think it’s important. Almost everyone I know has at some point or another struggled with their mental health and I figured out ways of dealing with mine which was that I go running every day. But I think everyone goes through things and it is important to talk about it and to allow yourself to be vulnerable.\n\n \n\n[Andy]: All in all, this seems to be a very personal album from you in an almost cathartic sense to it. What do you hope the listeners gain from listening to it?\n\n \n\n[Aaron]: Well. I think the record is special in the sense that the music is very hypnotic and experimental at times. But I think compositionally it’s ambitious and we pulled something off in terms of just making a record that… It feels new to me like there is quite a bit going on it that feels like it was pushing somewhere, and we arrived. I think there’s a lot of emotional kind of powerful sentiment in it that feels hopeful but also, there’s this cathartic feeling in it where you can feel… I don’t know. You can feel the pandemic was obviously looming in the background like a twilight, there’s these powerful songs about family and about love, anxiety, and mental health. It doesn’t feel too heavy, there’s something about, I’ve been trying to make an album that might feel a little bit like ‘The Last Waltz’ which is the great American band, when they made their farewell, they brought together all their friends and performed this incredible concert which became a film. I felt like maybe Big Red Machine at this time, I was imagining, ‘what if we never played a concert again?’ [laughs] so I tried to get all my friends together and make a big record that was full of emotion, and I think that’s what it is.\n\n \n\n[Andy]: I think that really reflects well in the music. I’ve had the great fortune of being able to listen to it beforehand. I think it really reflects really well with what you say.\n\n \n\n[Aaron]: Thank you.\n\n \n\n[Andy]: My final question for you is… You’ve seemingly done it all as a producer now. You’ve won Grammys, you play in The National, you’ve worked with Taylor Swift. What’s next?\n\n \n\n[Aaron]: Well I think that’s the amazing thing about any creative pursuit. No matter what you’ve done, basically the next time you do anything you might fall on your face. So it feels like I’ve never done anything at all in a way [chuckles] I don’t know, I think every time I start again, it feels like I might not make it, or I might not make something special, so for me it’s really just trying to stay inspired, try to be a good dad and a good husband. You know, to somehow balance life and stay creative and keep growing as a musician. If that means I make records that win Grammys, great, but if it means I just play the guitar by myself and enjoy that, that’s also fine. I try to take it one day at a time and not think too much.",

And then normally, back then I’d probably just do like a worktape or whatever, and I would throw it into my Garage Band on my computer just to save it and label it. But for some reason, I never labeled it correctly and I just didn't think about it. And then, all of a sudden, Taylor comes out with ‘Tim McGraw’, and all of a sudden she’s a star. My publisher at the time, she’s going, ‘Where is that song you wrote with Taylor!?’ And I was like…'I cannot find it.' I had a Taylo Swift song but I had lost it. Three years later at the BMI Pop Awards in Los Angeles, I go up to say hi to Taylor and she asks, \"What happened to that song we wrote?\" I said I had lost it so she sang the whole chorus and told me the title. I went back that night to where I was staying, found the song, and demo'ed it three years later.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor’s sound has evolved dramatically over the last decade, and among her collaborators, you’ve been one of the few constants through those changes. How did ‘Gold Rush’ come together?\n\nOne of the reasons that I've been able to work with her through many different time periods and sounds and whatnot is a deep belief in her process, that really rubs off on the people around her. It feels like we can continue to take these journeys together. “Gold Rush” was a pretty different sound than what was on “folklore.” Even the movement in the chorus and some of the chord changes, they're very outside of the realm for what we've done together. We have different processes. Sometimes we sit in a room, sometimes she'll send me a song, sometimes I'll send her a track. That was one where I had the track going. And she did the classic thing where you send it to her, and a very short time later, she sent back a voice note with all of these brilliant ideas of what the song is.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Lori McKenna Talks Writing “I Bet You Think About Me” with Taylor Swift\nLori McKenna is known for various hits. She’s written songs that have been recorded by Tim McGraw, George Strait, Little Big Town, Sara Bareilles, Lady Gaga, and many more. With cuts on upcoming projects from Thomas Rhett, Hailey Whitters, and Maren Morris, McKenna was also the only co-writer to pen the song, “I Bet You Think About Me” with superstar Taylor Swift which appears on Swift’s latest release, Red (Taylor’s Version).\n\n\n“That song was about 11 years old,” she pauses before adding, “We think.” Swift happened to be in the Boston area playing two sold-out shows at Gillette Stadium not too far from McKenna’s house. On the day of the second show, she visited Mckenna, they ate lunch and then planned to write together. “She had this little nugget of a song which was ‘I Bet You Think About Me,’ she knew that was the hook,” Mckenna tells us. \n\n\nSwift had asked her if she should lean in the folk direction (which they did) and after that, the rest flowed blissfully as McKenna recalls, “I don’t remember anything other than sitting here watching how incredible she is. She knows what she wants to say and when she says the right thing, she remembers it. She didn’t write anything down. There was no recording of the song.” McKenna was writing the lyrics on her computer but Swift never looked at her screen. “If the line is right, she knows it’s right, and she remembers what it is,” she says.\n\n\nLori McKenna\nLater that night, McKenna attended Swift’s show with her kids and when she was backstage, Swift played the song they had written together. “I’m like, how is this woman gonna get out there, do a completely choreographed show for 60 thousand people, and she’s singing the song that she just wrote two hours ago,” McKenna exclaims as she revisits the memory.\n\n\nWhen Red originally came out in October of 2012, “I Bet You Think About Me” didn’t make the final tracklist; McKenna thinks it might’ve been too country-centric for the direction Swift was moving in. “When they get to the studio, things change. I’ve done it myself. That’s just how music works,” McKenna states, completely understanding the decision that must’ve been made behind the scenes. “But for her to bring back something that was 10 or 11 years old and be true to a song that she had in her heart that long ago is pretty cool. It’s something that a lot of artists don’t get to do.”\n\n\n\nThis past summer Swift contacted McKenna and they spoke over the phone. “I talked to her for like a half an hour on the phone. She was like, ‘Remember this part? And we added this part, and then this part,’ it was like we wrote it yesterday.” The new version features husky backing vocals from country hit-maker Chris Stapleton. “I love the way it came out,” McKenna declares. “It’s so true to that original thought she had. She followed through 11 years later.”\n\n\nMake sure to come back to our site later this week to read our full interview with Grammy Award winner Lori McKenna.",

      "Transcript/Content": "With something like your work with Taylor Swift, where you didn’t know her at first and you started collaborating remotely during the pandemic, was it weird to not have the initial, “Hey, let’s sit in a room together and hash stuff out?”\n\nNo, that was the interesting and serendipitous thing about the collaboration between Taylor and me. It felt like the most natural thing in the world, even from the first hours after I sent her a folder of things I’d been working on. She wrote “Cardigan” so quickly and it felt like we wrote it together somehow, in the room. It was literally just the music that I had made basically as it is. When she sent back “Cardigan,” a few hours after I’d sent her the music, it felt almost like we architected it together in the room because of the progression of it, and the completeness of it, and just structurally, the dynamics. It was surreal to both of us how realized that felt. Then it just kept going.\n\nI think I realized all of the work that I’d done over the years, writing songs, essentially in a similar way with The National maybe prepared me for that. Not to work remotely, and not be in the same space with someone, because with National songs you also have to imagine the song. You know, create something that has a structure that [National vocalist] Matt [Berninger] can carve into.\n\n...\n\nThere’s always one or two songs on a record, whatever record it is, that are the tricky ones, but you see them through. Sometimes there can be these lightning in a bottle moments where it’s somewhat instantaneous and you just accept it. Then there’s other times where it’s this long arduous struggle to find it. I think both are important. Taylor said this to me, numerous times during the period that we worked together, which is that it seemed as though for both, her and for me, everything we had done in the past has prepared us to move at the speed that we were moving. It all felt like all the experiences that we had and techniques were colliding in a way that allowed us to go at this weird light-speed for a year. It was also just the fact that the world had slowed down and there was very little outside distraction because of that.\n\nYou’ve set a precedent of lightning speed with Taylor Swift. If you worked together on something else, would you try to follow that same situation, or was it unique to the fact that it was during quarantine?\n\nI think in a lot of ways it is unique to quarantine, but I also think you have a flow with someone, you understand each other. That’s it again, the thing I love about collaboration, you feel like you know someone in a very deep way, it’s just so personal. So, I don’t know if we did more together, if it would beat that same speed, but there is an understanding and there’s a communication. A shorthand, emotionally.\n\nTaylor Swift’s fans are experts on her output and have specific ideas about her work. They’ve embraced you as a collaborator, because you made records with her that they enjoy. Did you fear, at all, that you’d create a record they hated? You’d have this very large audience of people mad at you.\n\nWhile we were making Folklore, I had moments where I would wonder how it’d be received because she has such a passionate fan base. They’re all encyclopedic about her songs and her collaborators and it was a little scary, but one of my favorite things about Taylor is the way she makes everybody around her feel confident and appreciated and fearless, literally, to quote her own song. But I think first of all, no one outside of the two of us and Jon Low, even the people that played on the record, really knew what it was. So it felt like this cocoon that we were in to be creative. It was very conducive to not having anxiety. It created this environment that didn’t feel anxious and I didn’t worry. And luckily people fell in love with it.\n\nWe were actually on the phone as it came out midnight July 24th or whatever, just drinking wine and enjoying seeing the reaction. She had kept it a secret that she made a video for “Cardigan.” There was a lot of surprises and fun, mystery that that was going on. Whether I knew about things or not. You know, for all of us that worked on it, it felt like we were able to do our best work because we didn’t feel insecure or exposed or anything. It’s a special thing about her. She didn’t make me feel the shadow of her accomplishments.\n\nThat’s something that I’ve been thinking about a lot, music for the sake of making it, or being creative because it makes you feel good or gives you hope or gives you a spring in your step. Don’t think critically or don’t have self-doubt in the moment because it is paralyzing. Later, when you’re done, you can always see what you think is worthy of sharing, and what isn’t.",

That was actually Taylor’s call,” O’Brien says. “After we did just one take of the kitchen scene, she came over and she was like, ‘This is it. I’m going to use this dialogue. We’re going to let this play. You’re right in the pocket. Let’s just do it again.’ And that is such a testament to her instincts as a director, which I found super impressive. So to make that [kitchen fight] call on the fly, she’s the shit.”",

What was your experience like working with Taylor?\n\nFirst of all, it was surreal. She's genuinely such an incredible person that it felt like friends making something. By the time we did it, it was just really fun, really cozy and a really comfortable environment. I trusted her implicitly and not surprisingly at all, she had a fucking plan and knew exactly what she wanted to do. From the second that we first talked, she sent me over her entire lookbook for the film. She had the DP that she wanted to reach out to, she had the aesthetic, she wanted to shoot on film, and she had it all locked in. I thought that it was an incredibly important thing that she was trying to say with the video, too, which I felt like I got and wanted to really take part in executing.\n\nMost Popular\nThe Best Time to Eat Breakfast?

There are people on this earth who fundamentally understand how people work and how dynamics work more than others, and I think that's what makes her such a brilliant writer. She's such a fucking god-given poet. It was automatic that I was gonna say \"yes\" to it.

      "Transcript/Content": "There’s Something About Dylan O’Brien\nHis liberal-leaning tweets regularly go viral. Taylor Swift hand-selected him for her “All Too Well” short film. And he’s starring in some of the most hotly anticipated movies of 2022. What is it about this guy?\n\nby Samantha Leach\nMarch 16, 2022\n\nThis talent caught the eye of another high-profile fan, Taylor Swift, who was re-releasing her first five records after her masters were sold to Scooter Braun in 2019. For Red (Taylor’s Version), she had decided to write and direct a short film to accompany a 10-minute version of what is arguably her most heartbreaking ballad in a discography chock-full of heartbreakers: “All Too Well.” Though she and O’Brien had never met, Swift believed that he was the only actor who could imbue the music video’s de facto villain with the necessary pathos.\n\n“Dylan was my first choice for the ‘All Too Well’ short film because he has that versatility I was looking for,” Swift writes over email. “I’d seen his work and heard nothing but wonderful things about him as a person. Ultimately I want to work with people who love what they do and come at it with enthusiasm, because that’s how I approach creating things too.” Swift sent O’Brien a novella-length text message asking him to do it — he spends over five minutes scrolling through their text thread to show it to me; there are a lot of messages in its wake — and O’Brien agreed without hesitation. “I had a feeling he would be great at ad libbing and adding nuance to his character, which enriched the story tenfold,” Swift writes. “He absolutely blew me away and I feel really lucky that I gained such a great friend from the experience too.”\n\nDylan O'Brien sitting legs-crossed and looking to his right\nFor O’Brien, the most surprising part of the experience of working with Swift was the canonical perfectionist’s ability to cede control. “For someone who’s that meticulous, she’s so trusting. Sometimes we’d do one take, which was so the opposite of neurotic,” he says of the shoot, which took place over two days in New York. Swift also allowed O’Brien and co-star Sadie Sink to contribute to the creative process, which led to one of the film’s most wrenching moments, when the music stops and the two fight after a fraught dinner party. “Everything was planned to be to music. But then when we played out that scene [with dialogue]. [Taylor] immediately marched over and was just like, ‘This is it. I’m going to play this in the video.’ The confidence to just identify that in the moment on set and take in what we were bringing to it [shows how] she’s so sound with relationships and her instincts.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Lori McKenna Shares her “Extraordinary” Experience Songwriting with Taylor Swift\nLori McKenna: \"It's one of those real fun co-writes where you're just the cheerleader\"\nby Cindy Watts 5/4/2022\nLori McKenna has had a hand in writing some of country music’s biggest hits, including Tim McGraw’s “Humble and Kind,” Carrie Underwood’s “Cry Pretty” and Little Big Town’s “Girl Crush.”\n\nBut Taylor Swift might be her most famous collaborator. The pair wrote Swift’s hit “I Bet You Think About Me” before Swift played at Gillette Stadium. The song was on 2021 on “Red (Taylor’s Version).”\n\nMcKenna dropped by to chat with Thomas Rhett on Where We Started Radio about her memories songwriting with Swift.\n\nIt started as a surprise.\n\n“A couple days before she gets here, I’m eating dinner with the kids, and I get a FaceTime from a number I didn’t know,” McKenna said. “This is back 10-something years ago. And I answer it because we were like, ’Who’s FaceTiming me?’ And it’s Taylor like, ’Hey, I’m coming to town. Would you have some time?'”\n\nMcKenna and Swift share a mutual friend – songwriter Liz Rose. McKenna had met Swift once or twice, and McKenna said sure.\n“(She had) two sold-out nights at Gillette Stadium,” McKenna recalled. “And she showed up at my house, day of the first show with this song. She pretty much had the “I Bet You Think…” she had the title. She had what she wanted to say. She kind of just wanted somebody to bounce stuff off of.”\n\nMcKenna said she checked in with Rose to make she remembered the story correctly because Swift has such a unique way of songwriting.\nShe doesn’t take notes.\n\n“I was like, ’Am I crazy? Do I remember this right?'” she remembers asking Rose. “She didn’t write down anything. She just remembers. And it’s one of those real fun co-writes where you’re just the cheerleader. You’re the coffee maker. You’ll get a sandwich if they need to eat or something, but you’re there for moral support.”\n\nMcKenna said she tried to just be there, listen, and be her best friend during the process.\n\n“If there was something that I thought I could add, and she just wrote this song, and we sang it maybe once, and I typed the lyrics, and she jumped in a car, went to the show,” McKenna said.\n\nMcKenna and her kids went to Swift’s sold-out show at Gillette Stadium, too, and she says the singer “took care of us all night long.”\n\n“It was extraordinary,” McKenna said.",

      "Transcript/Content": "The National’s Aaron Dessner: ‘I learned a lot from Taylor Swift – from the focus and the joy she has’\nInterviewAhead of The National’s ninth studio album release, the band’s songwriter explains why the pandemic was a challenging yet incredibly fertile period of creativity for the band\nBy Laura Barton\n\nAugust 19, 2022 7:01 am\n“Sorry for my appearance,” says Aaron Dessner, when his face appears, tanned and bleary, across the Zoom screen one early August afternoon. “I haven’t showered in a while. We’ve been doing a little work…”\n\n“Doing a little work” is Dessner’s default position. Today, he is in the South of France, in the home office of his twin brother, Bryce, kicking back with a spot of light songwriting between tours with their band, The National. In the preceding two months, they have played 21 shows, from Paris to Berlin to Rhode Island.\n\nEven as the world lay landlocked, Dessner ploughed an industrious pandemic, producing two albums for Taylor Swift, and recording a second record with Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon and a cast of luminaries including Sharon Van Etten, Anais Mitchell, and Robin Pecknold of Fleet Foxes, as part of their side-project Big Red Machine.\n\nAlongside, there was further production work with artists such as King Princess, Ben Howard and Indigo Spark, soundtracks for Joe Wright’s Cyrano, and Mike Mills’ C’mon C’mon, and a new National record, scheduled for next year. “It is true, I have a lot of things that I’ve been working on,” Dessner concedes.\n\n“But I feel like we’ve always been busy. Maybe it’s just that people are more aware of it now.”\n\nFor 20 years, across eight album cycles, The National had toured consistently. When the pandemic came, it brought an unprecedented stretch of time at home for Dessner, allowing him to deepen his relationships with his work, and his family, and himself.\n\n“I think we got used to playing shows as being one of our primary creative outlets instead of being home and creating new music and playing around with new ideas and developing new skills, so I think for me the pandemic was this huge growing period,” he says. “I was just making so much music. I learned so much in that time.”\n\nDessner describes the intensity of that period: “It was almost like I was in some crazy boot camp for making a tonne of music really fast and fully producing it and then it would be released quickly,” he recalls.\n\n“And you learn a lot when you’re doing that. Even just working with Taylor, she’s a brilliant musician and so experienced in terms of making records, so I was learning from her – I picked up a focus, and also just the joy that she has.”\n\nIn his work from that time, particularly as a producer and in his evolution to frontman of Big Red Machine, Dessner emerged as an independent creative force. It’s a transition that still seems surprising to him; in conversation he will often focus on the talents of others, or habitually use “we” rather than “I” – referring variously to his band or his brother. It is as if he still can’t quite disentangle an idea of himself as anything other than a team player.\n\nAs an identical twin, this perhaps seems natural. Until they were 18, he and Bryce shared a room, then continued to play in bands together in adulthood, for a long time sharing hotel rooms on tour, and for many years living on the same street in Brooklyn.\n\nWhen the pandemic came, he in the US, Bryce now living in France, it brought about a sudden estrangement of geography.\n\n“It was very emotional for us to be separated, in ways that we didn’t fully understand,” Dessner says. “At first we tried to stay in touch, but as we both got busy with our lives there started to be some angst and even fears of abandonment or something.” He smiles. “Unconscious twin stuff.”\n\n“It’s such a great thing to be a twin, but also it’s complex, because your centre of gravity is your twin,” he continues. “So when you’re apart you’re unbalanced in some weird way. It’s more natural for us to be in the same place. That feels better.” He recalls the day he was finally able to fly to see Bryce in France. “And he picked me up and took me to the beach,” he remembers. “And we jumped into the ocean together, and it felt like life was starting again.”\n\nThis summer, the return to touring ruffled the steady work routine Dessner had established at home. “When you’re on tour you get back into that weird rhythm of suspended reality,” he says. To counteract the stupor roadlife can encourage, the band has taken along a mobile recording studio and the company of their long-time engineer, Bella Blasko. “It feels important to stay in a creative mode and not just atrophy after playing for two hours – as fun as that is,” he says.\n\nIt’s a tangibly different experience to recording at Long Pond, his home studio in upstate New York, which Dessner designed and built to cater specifically to his own way of working. Still, there are rewards to be found in the mobile set-up.\n\n“On tour, you wake up in a different place every day,” he says. “And there’s something exciting about that, because you hear things differently, and I think limitations can be good. You’re forced to be industrious and resourceful in a way that maybe you wouldn’t be if you had everything at your fingertips. It’s also fun just to feel that engine again of The National. I think all of us didn’t realise how much we missed it.”\n\nIt was late May in Pamplona, Spain, when the band took to the stage for the first time in two and a half years. “We were a little bit frozen up there or something,” he smiles. “It kind of took a second, but as the tour went on I actually feel like we’re playing better than we ever have.”\n\nDessner believes the new album to be a “major work” for The National, sitting easily alongside the band’s most acclaimed records such as Boxer, High Violet, and the Grammy-winning Sleep Well Beast.\n\n“It’s interesting – I would say you can hear elements of all of our records in these new songs,” he says. “There is the ferocity of Alligator, but there’s also the experimentalism of Sleep Well Beast, and the beauty and directness of Boxer, and I feel that maybe also comes with [having had] some space.”\n\nThe band’s last record, 2019’s I Am Easy To Find, was the closest The National had ever come to making a concept album, with a host of female guest vocalists, released in tandem with a short film by director Mike Mills. “I love that record, but it does feel more like an idea than we achieved somehow,” Dessner says.\n\nOSLO, NORWAY - JUNE 09: Aaron Dessner (L) and Scott Devendorf from The National perform on stage at the Loaded Festival on June 09, 2022 in Oslo, Norway.

But now it’s about writing songs that feel very personal, and very connected.”\n\nMusically, Dessner says the writing of new material has reminded him of earlier albums, “when we would really throw the table over sometimes. Some things feel effortless, and in others you can hear The National stretching into new places – there’s new processes and new sounds. So that’s very exciting, I think.”\n\nFamously, the in-studio dynamics of The National have often been fraught. Vincent Moon’s 2008 documentary A Skin, A Night captured some of the tensions of making Boxer, while the band have spoken openly about the intense negotiations that enable their fine balance of musical complexity and crowd-charming directness. In the writing of their track “Lemonworld”, they famously drafted 80 versions of the song, squabbling over lyrics, title, and whether or not the guitar riff sounded too much like U2.\n\nThis time, Dessner insists, has been better. “It’s been a nice process,” he says – the result, perhaps, of the feeling of running on the fumes of touring. “Everyone had their own experiences during the time away, and coming back into it you naturally lean into each other,” he explains.\n\nBryan and Scott Devendorf spent much of the last two years making music with other musicians. Singer and lyricist Matt Berninger released a solo record, and is now “in a very prolific mode, and also revising songs, and he’s singing really well”, he says. At his home in France, Bryce met his brother’s prolificacy, working on scores and classical compositions.\n\n“So I think everyone seems changed in a way,” Dessner says. “And there’s definitely a full tank of creative energy. It feels like we’re trusting each other more. I think famously we were this embattled, dysfunctional but obviously great band. It was not easy. But right now there’s a divide and conquer feeling where everyone’s just doing what they do best.”\n\nThe National headline All Points East on Friday 28 August",

      "Transcript/Content": "The first time we worked together, we did a few songs — Taylor works with several producers on records and they do lots of songs and they narrow it down to 12, whatever they are. And a lot of songs don’t end up on the record. So that one did, and it was a duet that she brought Ed Sheeran to sing on.\n\nWe did it in my studio and of course, a lot of the way I work is I’ll be building a track quickly to put the song together, whether it’s a demo or a final recording. It’s usually “to be determined,” but I try to make it sound as much as I want it to in my head and like a record from the get-go, and that was essentially just the raw version of the demo that I did. I would go back in and spruce things up and replace sounds with other things, but she felt like the magic was in the initial recording, which I respected and loved her for that. So that’s the version that’s on the first record.\n\nI also respect her for doing what she did, which is re-recording her entire catalog verbatim, emphasizing that we needed to recreate it exactly. So [with Red (Taylor’s Version)], I hadn’t heard those tracks since I did them, which would have been over a decade ago, and of course, it was the pandemic, so we had to literally do it remotely — I didn’t even see or talk to Taylor or Ed once, It was all over email. I got the vocal from Ed, re-sung, I got the background vocals re-sung, and then I got vocals from Gary Lightbody from Snow Patrol as well, and then I got the lead vocal re-cut by Taylor.\n\nThey all did it at their own studios, their own technology. They sent me their files and I recreated it completely from scratch, the recording I had done anyway. And luckily, I had played everything on the original version anyway, all the instruments, so I was able to do it by muscle memory because otherwise, if I had to play someone else’s part during the pandemic, it would have been a time-consuming nightmare because I would’ve had to sub out and find other players, maybe those same players.\n\nBut luckily, historically, I’ve always been with solo artists and the only guy in the room making the music, so I’m the band guy. So I re-cut the drums, I re-cut the bass, I re-cut the guitars around Ed giving me one acoustic track that he did, and I did the rest, including strings and stuff. To say it was “deja-vu” is an understatement. It was like, “Oh my god, it’s so weird, I’m hearing this all over again.” And there’s something fun about that challenge of having to match something that you had done before, so that was fun. Obviously, I was glad to be apart of it. I’m glad she called me back, she didn’t call every producer back.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Named Songwriter-Artist of the Decade by NSAI: Read Her Speech\nShe accepted the designation from the Nashville Songwriters Association International’s honor at the historic Ryman Auditorium\nBy Evan Minsker\nSeptember 20, 2022\n\n\nAhead of the release of her new album Midnights next month, Taylor Swift was named the Songwriter-Artist of the Decade by the Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI). She gave a speech tonight at the NSAI 2022 Nashville Songwriter Awards, which took place at the historic Ryman Auditorium. She discussed her history as a songwriter, the way she categorizes the songs she writes, and her process of re-recording her first albums. Read her speech below.\n\nWell, hi.\n\nI want to say thank you to Bart for introducing me in such a generous way and I want to say thank you to the NSAI for getting us all together for this event. For me, tonight feels brimming with a genuine camaraderie between a bunch of people who just love making stuff. Who love the craft. Who live for that rare, pure moment when a magical cloud floats down right in front of you in the form of an idea for a song, and all you have to do is grab it. Then shape it like clay. Prune it like a garden. And then wish on every lucky star or pray to whatever power you believe in that it might find its way out into the world and make someone feel seen, feel understood, feel joined in their grief or heartbreak or joy for just a moment.\n\nI’ve learned by being in the entertainment industry for an extended period of time that this business operates with a very new, new, new, next, next, next mentality. For every artist or songwriter, we’re all just hoping to have one great year. One great album cycle. One great run at radio. And, these days, one song that goes viral on TikTok. One glorious moment in the sun. Because on your next project you’ll probably have to invent a new thing to be. Think of all new things to say, and fresh ways to say them. You will have to entertain people. And the fact is that what entertains us is either seeing new artists emerge or established artists showing us a new side to themselves. If we are very, very lucky, life will say to us, “Your song is great.” The next thing life will say is, “What else can you do?”\n\nTrending Now\n\nI say all of this because I’m up here receiving this beautiful award for a decade of work, and I can’t possibly explain how nice that feels. Because the way I see it, this is an award that celebrates a culmination of moments. Challenges. Gauntlets laid down. Albums I’m proud of. Triumphs. Strokes of luck or misfortune. Loud, embarrassing errors and the subsequent recovery from those mistakes, and the lessons learned from all of it. This award celebrates my family and my co-writers and my team. My friends and my fiercest fans and my harshest detractors and everyone who entered my life or left it. Because when it comes to my songwriting and my life, they are one in the same. As the great Nora Ephron once said, “Everything is copy.”\n\nTwenty years ago I wrote my first song. I used to dream about one day getting to bounce around the different musical worlds of my various sonic influences, and change up the production of my albums. I hoped that one day, the blending of genres wouldn’t be such a big deal. There’s so much discussion about genre and it always usually leads back to a conversation about melody and production. But that leaves out possibly my favorite part of songwriting: lyricism.\n\nAnd I’ve never talked about this publicly before, because, well, it’s dorky. But I also have, in my mind, secretly, established genres categories for lyrics I write. Three of them, to be exact. They are affectionately titled Quill Lyrics, Fountain Pen Lyrics, and Glitter Gel Pen Lyrics.\n\nI know this sounds confusing, but I’ll try to explain. I came up with these categories based on what writing tool I imagine having in my hand when I scribbled it down, figuratively. I don’t actually have a quill. Anymore. I broke it once when I was mad.\n\nI categorize certain songs of mine in the Quill style if the words and phrasings are antiquated, if I was inspired to write it after reading Charlotte Brontë or after watching a movie where everyone is wearing poet shirts and corsets. If my lyrics sound like a letter written by Emily Dickinson’s great grandmother while sewing a lace curtain, that’s me writing in the Quill genre. I will give you an example from one of my songs I’d categorize as Quill.\n\nHow’s one to know\nI’d meet you where the spirit meets the bones\nIn a faith forgotten land\nIn from the snow, your touch brought forth an incandescent glow\nTarnished but so grand\n\nMoving on to Lyricism category number two: Fountain Pen Style. I’d say most of my lyrics fall into this category. Fountain Pen Style means a modern storyline or references, with a poetic twist. Taking a common phrase and flipping its meaning. Trying to paint a vivid picture of a situation, down to the chipped paint on the door frame and the incense dust on the vinyl shelf. Placing yourself and whoever is listening right there in the room where it all happened. The love, the loss, everything. The songs I categorize in this style sound like confessions scribbled and sealed in an envelope, but too brutally honest to ever send.\n\nFor example:\n\n’Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe’re dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer, and we’d swear to remember it all too well\n\nThe third category is called Glitter Gel Pen, and it lives up to its name in every way. Frivolous, carefree, bouncy, syncopated perfectly to the beat. Glitter Gel Pen lyrics don’t care if you don’t take them seriously because they don’t take themselves seriously. Glitter Gel Pen lyrics are the drunk girl at the party who tells you that you look like an Angel in the bathroom. It’s what we need every once in a while in these fraught times in which we live.\n\nExample:\n\nMy ex man brought his new girlfriend\nShe’s like, “Oh my God,” but I’m just gonna shake\nAnd to the fella over there with the hella good hair,\nWon’t you come on over, baby?\nWe can shake, shake, shake\n\nWhy did I make these categories, you ask? Because I love doing this thing we are fortunate enough to call a job. Writing songs is my life’s work and my hobby and my never-ending thrill. I am moved beyond words that you, my peers, decided to honor me in this way for work I’d still be doing if I had never been recognized for it.\n\nLately, I’ve been on a joyride down memory lane. I’ve been re-recording my first six albums. When I go through the process of meticulously recreating each element of my past and revisiting songs I wrote when I was 13, 14, and 15, that path leads me right to music row. How my mom would pick me up from school and drive me to my co-writing sessions with dozens of writers (and some of you are in this very room tonight), who 15 years ago decided to give me their time, their wisdom, their belief before anyone thought writing with me was a productive use of an afternoon. I will never forget you, every last one of you.\n\nPart of my re-recording process has included adding songs that never made the original albums, but songs I hated to leave behind. I’ve gone back and recorded a bunch of them for my version of my albums. Fearless, my version, came out last year and, as I was choosing songs for it, I came across one I’d written with the Warren Brothers when I was 14. I decided to record it as a duet with the brilliant Keith Urban. When I called the the Warrens up to tell them I was cutting our song 17 years after we’d written it, I’ll never forget the first thing they said: “Well, I think that’s the longest hold we’ve ever had.”\n\nIn 2011, just over 10 years ago, my trusted collaborator and confidante Liz Rose came over to my apartment and I showed her a song I’d been working on. I was going through a rough time (as is the natural state of being 21) and had scribbled down verse after verse after verse, a song that was too long to put on an album. It clocked in at around 10 minutes. We set out editing, trimming, cutting out big sections until it was a reasonable 5 minutes and 30 seconds. It was called “All Too Well.” Last year, when I re-recorded my 2012 album Red, I included this 10-minute version with its original verses and extra bridges. I never could’ve imagined when we wrote it that that song would be resurfacing 10 years later or that I’d be about to play it for you tonight.\n\nBut a song can defy logic or time. A good song transports you to your truest feelings and translates those feelings for you. A good song stays with you even when people or feelings don’t. Writing songs is a calling and getting to call it your career makes you very lucky. You have to be grateful every day for it, and all the people who thought your words might be worth listening to. This town is the school that taught me that.\n\nTo be honored by you means more than any genre of my lyrics could ever say.\n\nThank you.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Midnights Co-Producer Sounwave Says ‘Karma’ Was a ‘Last-Minute Hail Mary’ He Sent Taylor Swift\nThe frequent Jack Antonoff collaborator also talks about working on \"Lavender Haze\" with \"creative genius\" Zoë Kravitz.\n\nBy Brittany Spanos\n\nOctober 26, 2022\n\nTaylor Swift’s Midnights has been billed as the first truly collaborative album she’s made with producer Jack Antonoff, but the LP and the extended 3am version feature plenty of other names, both old and new in the Swift realm. One of those is Mark Anthony Spears, a.k.a. Sounwave, who collaborated on three tracks with Swift and Antonoff. \n\nSounwave first cut his teeth as a key member of Top Daw Entertainment, where he worked with Kendrick Lamar and other TDE heavyweights since 2011. He won a Grammy for “Alright” in 2015 and nabbed an Oscar nomination for Black Panther’s “All the Stars.”\n\nSince then, he’s been teaming up with other major names in pop and rap, like Beyoncé, FKA Twigs, and Chloe x Halle. He eventually struck up a friendship with Antonoff, with whom he and fellow producer/songwriter Sam Dew formed the trio Red Hearse. Antonoff ended up pulling Sounwave into the Lover sessions, and they worked on the Britpop-inspired track “London Boy” together.\n\n“Me and Jack, we keep each other informed on any project we’re working on,” Spears tells Rolling Stone. “We usually take at least a week out of the year just to create with no goal in mind. That’s basically how Red Hearse was created.”\n\nBefore Antonoff began to work on Swift’s tenth album, he was cooking up tracks with Spears, Dew, and Zoë Kravitz. (Kravitz revealed earlier this year that she is currently working on her debut solo album with Antonoff). During a brainstorming session, the quartet put together a track that would eventually become “Lavender Haze.”\n\n“It was not specifically meant for anything,” he recalls. “That one was me going through sounds for 15 minutes and eventually hitting one button by accident. Jack’s eyes lit up and was like ‘What was that?’It just happened to be this small little loop that my guy Jahaan [Sweet, fellow TDE producer] sent me a while back.”\n\nSpears twisted up the loop and they added a bunch of effects to make it sound the way it does now. “Sam went in with the melodies. Zoë is actually a creative genius. She’s not just a phenomenal actor. Her ability to create different sonics and find different melodies is next level.” \n\nA few months later, Antonoff reached out to Spears, Dew, and Kravitz to see if he could pitch the song to Swift, who loved it immediately. She wrote lyrics inspired by a Mad Men scene, numerous tabloid rumors and online gossip about her relationship status, and “1950s expectations.”\n\n“When Jack brought us in the hear for the first time, all our mouths dropped. She took it to a whole new world and made it her own. She created different pockets we did not hear.”\n\n“Glitch,” one of the bonus songs on the Midnights (3am) edition, was born from the same studio session as “Lavender Haze.” The bubbly “Karma” came later, when Antonoff reached out to Spears for any other ideas he may have to contribute to the album and its synth-pop vision.\n\n“‘Karma’ was just a last-minute Hail Mary,” Spears says. “I remembered I was working with my guy Keanu [Beats] and had something that was too perfect not to send to her. As soon as I sent it, Jack was instantly like ‘This is the one. Playing it for Taylor now. We’re going in on it.’ The next day, I heard the final product with her vocals on it.”\n\nWhile it’s still too early to tell which songs will be the runaway successes from the album, it’s clear “Karma” has struck a chord on TikTok, nearing 20,000 videos for the official sound with only a few days under its belt.\n\n“Such a fun song! It instantly rings up and you just feel joy inside. And the messaging is so cool,” Spears says.\n\nSpears only heard a few other songs from the LP prior to its officially release; Antonoff had sent over a sampling of what him and Swift had made so Spears had a sense of the sound they were going for when he went to reproduce the beats following the lyric and vocal additions. He was impressed by the sound, concept and surprise drop of seven extra tracks. He even has favorites already.\n\n“Right now I’m going back and forth from ‘Anti-Hero’ and ‘Glitch.’ Not to toot my own horn, but I like the weirdness of ‘Glitch.’ The breakdown part is everything it was meant to be. This is so amazing to me.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "We Appeared in Taylor Swift's Anti-Hero Music Video in Very Unusual Way'\nPublished Oct 28, 2022 at 8:06 PM EDT\nBy Josh Siegel\n\nTaylor Swift is one of the most likable and recognisable artists in the world and extremely talented as a singer and songwriter so, of course, I was very aware of who she is; I have two daughters so her music is often being played in our house. But I never thought she would have any direct involvement in my life.\n\nMy funeral casket company was founded in 2016 and my co-founder, Scott Ginsberg, had been in the casket business for twenty years as a manufacturer and seller. He saw an industry with a series of broken experiences; families who would suffer a loss and go to their local funeral home to purchase a coffin, understandably they aren't educated on the products, so they end up picking what's put in front of them and paying too much money. In our opinion, they weren't getting the experience they should have during a very meaningful time, where they are trying to grieve.\n\nI had been working in selling and shipping when he contacted me with the idea of selling caskets online. I immediately saw a parallel to other companies who had seen a fairly monopolistic industry and had been able to deal with overpricing and create a real benefit for consumers.\n\nTaylor Swift's Anti-Hero Video Featured Joshua's Casket\nTaylor Swift attends the 2022 MTV VMAs at Prudential Center on August 28, 2022 in Newark, New Jersey. Swift's Anti-Hero music video featured a casket from Joshua Siegel's funeral casket brand Titan Casket. Photo by Arturo Holmes/FilmMagic\nI thought we could do something similar in this industry, but also just really help the millions of families who are going through a difficult week. So, I recruited my wife Liz, who is an ex-attorney and had taken some years off to raise our three kids, and the three of us together created our current business.\n\nIn late October, our company had a very big day, with me speaking before the Federal Trade Commission about the \"Funeral Rule,\" which requires funeral homes to accept caskets bought by consumers from a third party.\n\nA \"Swiftie\" shares some surprising news\nWe thought we were settling into a nice quiet Friday, but woke up to one of our employees, who is a big \"Swiftie\", claiming one of our caskets was prominently featured in the music video for the song Anti-Hero.\n\nIn this business, whenever you see a casket on screen, you ask where it's from. So she sent it to my wife, who remembered we had sold a casket to a production company for a music video back in July, but for all we knew it was a local band or used in the background for something.\n\nWe never expected to have one of the most famous people on the planet not only use the casket in the video, but be hugging it and using it as a central part of the video to her most popular song of the album.\n\nRead more\n'I'm a Taylor Swift Lookalike—I Get Thousands of Hate Messages a Day'\n'I'm a Kris Jenner Lookalike, Celebrities Mistake Me For Her'\n'I Host Huge Taylor Swift Dance Parties Across America'\nOur company regularly has production or film companies approach us, because we're one of the few casket companies who operate online. Often they need a casket for a prop, they'll search online and find us. We've done collaborations with TV series' including Interview with the Vampire and Castle Rock.\n\nHow Taylor Swift's team got our casket\nThe production company behind Anti-Hero—although we didn't know they were working on that particular music video at the time— had phoned us three months before the album release and said: \"Hey, we're doing this for a music video, can you sign this release form.\" That was the last we heard of it. It wasn't a major event of the day, so we had forgotten about it until we woke up this Friday.\n\nWe wanted to confirm it was our casket in Taylor Swift's video, even though we as a manufacturer were 95 percent sure, so we reached out to the production company and they said: \"Absolutely, that's what we bought from you, we're the same people.\" So over the day it slowly sunk in.\n\n\nNot only did we recognize the casket, but fans of Swift detected exactly where the coffin was from before we confirmed it. I am absolutely impressed, I don't know how they found out. The casket gained some attention online, but the real thing I was surprised by was the reaction.\n\nThe reaction from Taylor Swift's fans\nOf course, you put a casket out there, people are going to react with puns and funny comments. Many people were there saying: \"omg\" or \"this is ridiculous\", but when I jumped in immediately and said: \"Hey, that's us, and by the way I'm glad you're here,\" and explained what our goal is within the industry, there was this real outpouring of comments saying: \"This is a really positive thing.\" I was happy with the reaction from what is probably a generally younger fanbase, who aren't thinking about these issues but now know.\n\nI think this generation is more used to engaging with brands on a very personal level because of the nature of social media and people were having conversations in the same way they would with any other consumer brand.\n\nThey were asking for gift codes for \"Swifties\", which I am happy to do. A few even called us and asked whether they could buy the actual casket that she was in, which we don't have in stock, but has obviously become a collectors item. There have been a few extra sales of that item than usual, but it's hard to tie that back to the fact that it was in this video.\n\nI think that our company is asking families to take such a leap of faith to buy their caskets outside of their funeral homes, so I think us having this type of coverage can help families make informed decisions in a very difficult time.\n\nI am, one hundred percent, more of a Taylor Swift fan now. I wouldn't typically be listening to the album on repeat, but this has been such a positive experience and I imagine I will be telling this story for the rest of my life.\n\nJosh Siegel is the co-founder of online coffin manufacturer Titan Casket.

But unfortunately FAKE NEWS :(\" he tweeted after a speculative tracklist that contained a 1975 feature made the rounds on social media.\n\nMidnights came out on Oct. 21, and does feature a collab with Lana Del Rey called \"Snow on the Beach.\"\n\nHealy previously expressed interest in working with the 11-time Grammy Award winner, and said on The Green Room podcast in 2019 that he'd be down to produce an acoustic record for her if she wanted.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Taylor Swift Announces Dates for 'Eras' Tour: 'A Journey Through the Musical Eras of My Career'\n\n\n\n\"I would never slag Taylor off, I think Taylor's amazing,\" he said. \"Taylor Swift doing an acoustic record? I can't think of a record that would sell more than that. Like, Taylor Swift's intimate return to country. Of course, you'd wanna produce that! She's [probably] gonna sit on that idea, but Taylor, if you ever want someone to help you set up the mics for your acoustic record, just so you know, I'm there.\"\n\nThe pair were briefly linked in 2015, though the \"About You\" singer described their bond as \"a flirtation\" in a 2016 interview with Q.\n\n The 1975's Matty Healy Calls Out Security in Autotune After Fan Falls at Concert: 'Stop Standing There'\n\"I mean, I got on E! News and people were like, 'Who's Matt Healy?' So that was cool,\" he said. \"But I didn't make a big deal out of it myself. It's not really anything to talk about, because if she wasn't Taylor Swift we wouldn't be talking about her. She wasn't a big impact on my life. It's just interesting to me how interested the world is about Taylor Swift.\"\n\nJack Antonoff is not the only collaborator Swift and Healy have in common; at The 1975's show in Los Angeles on Monday night, Healy brought out Phoebe Bridgers for an acoustic performance of \"Milk,\" an early deep cut off the 1975's second EP. Swift, meanwhile, recruited Bridgers for a feature on \"Nothing New (Taylor's Version),\" a vault track off Fearless.\n\nThe rest of Healy's Audacy interview will debut this Sunday at 8:45 p.m. ET.",

The National previously worked with Swift on Evermore‘s “Coney Island,” and Bryce’s brother Aaron Dessner frequently collaborates with the 11-time Grammy winner. “We’re all big fans of Taylor, and she’s been really generous with us, inviting us to be part of ‘Coney Island,'” Bryce shared. “And obviously my brother’s worked with her a lot, and I’ve done a bunch of orchestration for her albums.”\n\nHe continued, “‘The Alcott’ is a song that she co-wrote with Matt [Berninger], where she co-wrote the lyrics. It’s really amazing to hear her, the way she was able to take what Matt had done and then reinvent the song, and it’s really a special song.”\n\nAs for the inspiration behind The National’s literary album title, Bryce explained that Berninger came up with the name, after the frontman went through a pause in creativity. “I think he was just blocked about what he wanted to sing about, lyrics weren’t coming,” he shared. “And typically in the past, he’ll pick up favorite books, and so apparently he picked up Frankenstein, the [Mary] Shelley book — people know the film and some people don’t realize it’s based on a book — and that helped him get out of his, somehow opened a door for him. I’m not sure why, maybe thinking about monsters or something. But, it helped open the flood gates and in the later stages of the album, he started writing really quickly.”\n\nListen to the full interview on-demand on Apple Music here.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Liz Rose Chats About Writing \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" with Taylor Swift\nLiz Rose is nothing short of a songwriting powerhouse. Having written tracks for Miranda Lambert, Carrie Underwood, Lee Brice, Little Big Town, Dan + Shay, and Zac Brown Band, plus an abundance of others, she’s gone on to win one Country Music Association Award, one Academy of Country Music Award, and two Grammy Awards. Her name might ring a bell as Rose is best known for her work with Taylor Swift on her early projects. Rose has credits on Swift’s eponymous debut, Fearless, and Red.\n\n\nMost recently, Rose’s name has been added to the history books as “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” broke the record for the longest song to reach the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. It was previously held by “American Pie” by Don McLean which has clung to the record since 1972. Speaking of the track, Rose states, “First of all, it just blew my mind that she went back and pulled back all those pieces and put them back in. It was brilliant. I don’t know how she did it but I thought that was pretty amazing to take herself back to that moment.”\n\n\nRose recalls the moment they wrote the heartbreaking fan-favorite together. Swift had an inner monologue that continued to pour and pour. “When we wrote it, she came in and she just said, ‘I have all this stream of consciousness,’” Rose notes. “And she just started singing stuff and we started: what would hit us the hardest is what would go in the song.” When looking at the lyrics that were added to the 10-minute version of the track, Liz tells The Nash News, “Those were things that were in there, in her stream of consciousness, at the beginning when she started writing it.”\n\n\nCompared to previous songs Rose had written, “All Too Well” was a completely different animal due to the fast-paced thoughts Swift was having at the time of penning it and because of the heaviness of the lyricism. “It was such an emotional song and she had so many brilliant things coming out of her brain all at once. It was not a sit-down and look at it and piece it together kind of song,” Rose states. “Taylor sat down with a guitar and just started singing stuff. Then she sat down at the piano and kept singing.” \n\n\nAlthough the song was written a decade ago, Rose can vividly remember the day the two of them crafted it as she reminisces, “It was last minute; she just called me and said ‘I’ve got this thing and there’s so much and can you just come help me figure it out.’ It was a great day; it was a really great day. She’s just brilliant. She’s a genius.”\n\n\nLiz Rose has written other infamous Swift tracks like “You Belong With Me,” “Teardrops On My Guitar,” her debut single from 2006, “Tim McGraw,” and “White Horse” which went on to be both Swift and Rose’s first Grammy win. Rose was also a co-writer on the new vault track from the 2021 re-release of Fearless, “We Were Happy.” When the topic of vault tracks is brought up in our conversation, Rose says through a laugh, “Who does that? Only Taylor Swift. It’s so cool; it’s just so great.”\n\n\nRose is one of the few who have had the chance to watch Swift evolve as an artist from her teenage years at a close distance. When thinking back to earlier times, Rose brings up a past memory. “I remember when she wrote ‘Our Song’ and we had been writing quite a bit and she came in and said, ‘I’d written this song by myself, can I play it for you?’ and I was like, ‘Absolutely.’ I was just like, oh my god that is so brilliant.” She goes on to add, “You know, I think Taylor has gotten better. And what’s so brilliant about her is that she didn’t have to go off the rails and change everything she did. If you hear a Taylor Swift song now, you can go back and go, she’s doing the same thing she always did. She’s just older and talking about older subjects. She’s grown with her material and she’s perfected it. She doesn’t reinvent herself, she just grows. And I don’t think a lot of artists can do that. They try to outsmart themselves and she’s just trying to get better and evolve and she continues to do it.”\n\n\nWhen speaking about Swift, Rose reflects with utmost fervor and youthful exuberance. As excited as she is for Swift and her work, it’s exciting to hear her talk about it. \n\n\nShe concludes her praises for Swift by saying, “She is a singer-songwriter performing artist icon. You can’t put her in a box. She’s a superstar.” With an endearing sweetness she adds, “And it’s so funny ‘cause I used to call her that when she was like 17, I’d go ‘Hey superstar.’ I’m so proud of her; I’m still in awe of her.”",

She is in amazing shape,\" says the insider. \"She loves connecting with her fans again.\"\n\nThe 33-year-old singer-songwriter won't have to spend all her time alone on the road, according to the friend. \"Joe will travel with her when he can,\" the insider adds of Alwyn, 32. \"They are great together. Joe is super supportive of her career.\"\n\nSwift's Eras Tour launched last week in Glendale, Arizona and saw the musician captivate her audience with a massive, career-spanning 44-song setlist, as the show ran for 3 hours and 13 minutes. Throughout the concert, she nodded to each of her respective album eras and saved room at the end for her latest LP: Midnights.\n\nBefore performing \"Betty\" from Folklore — which was co-written by Alwyn under the pseudonym William Bowery — during the set, she opened up about her decision to create characters for the Grammy-winning album.\n\n\"Sort of a running theme in my music is that I love to explain to men how to apologize,\" Swift said. \"I just love it. It's kind of my thing. I love to tell them, step-by-step, here's how simple this is to fix things. If you just follow these easy steps that I'm laying out for you in a three-minute song... Just love the idea of men apologizing. And basically, this is a song about a teenage boy named James who was trying to apologize to the love of his life, and her name is Betty.\"\n\nThe Eras Tour continues in Las Vegas this coming weekend.",

They started dating in late 2016, and a source told ET back in October that they were \"doing great\" and that their \"relationship is super strong.\"\n\nThat update came just hours after Swift dropped her highly anticipated 10th studio album, Midnights, followed by seven additional songs released in her surprise 3am Edition of the album.\n\nWhen Swift dropped her album, ET meticulously broke down all the lyrics, including the opening track, \"Lavender Haze,\" which Swift confirmed was inspired by her and Alwyn's romance, and the lengths they go to quiet the outside noise.\n\n\"I happened on the phrase 'lavender haze' when I was watching Mad Men, and I looked it up because I thought it sounded cool, and it turns out that it's a common phrase used in the '50s where they would just describe being in love,\" she said at the time. \"If you were in the lavender haze that meant you were in that all-encompassing love glow. I thought that was really beautiful.\"\n\n\"I guess, theoretically, when you're in the lavender haze you'll do anything to stay there and not let people bring you down off of that cloud. I think a lot of people have to deal with this now, not just 'public figures,' because we live in the era of social media, and if the world finds out that you're in love with somebody they're going to weigh in on it,\" Swift added. \"Like my relationship for six years, we've had to dodge weird rumors, tabloid stuff and we just ignore it. This song is sort of about the act of ignoring that stuff to protect the real stuff.\"\n\nFor his part, Alwyn, 32, told British Vogue in September 2018 that he's keenly aware fans always want to be in the know when it came to his and Swift's relationship. \n\n\"I’m aware people want to know about that side of things,\" he told the magazine in reference to Swift. \"I think we have been successfully very private, and that has now sunk in for people.\"\n\nHer 2017 track \"Gorgeous\" off her Reputation album was also about Alwyn. Fans will recall a Swiftie revealed on Tumblr that, during a secret Reputation listening session, the songstress \"made us all promise that if anyone made any accusations of who this song is about, we will tell them it is 100 percent about her angel boyfriend of one year. This isn't a secret. She wanted us to tell people.\"\n\nAlwyn is also credited for the track \"Sweet Nothing\" on Midnights, but he's listed on the album under the familiar pseudonym, William Bowery. Alwyn previously contributed to Swift's 2020 albums, Folklore and Evermore, on the tracks \"Exile,\" \"Betty,\" \"Champagne Problems,\" \"Coney Island\" and \"Evermore.\"\n\nAlwyn's secret alias was eventually confirmed by Swift herself in her Disney+ special, Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions. He'd go on to win a GRAMMY in 2021 for his contributions. ",

      "Transcript/Content": "The National Want Their Taylor Swift Duet ‘The Alcott’ Played ‘in Context’\nBy Ryan Leas\n\nPicture going back ten years and telling someone the National and Taylor Swift would make a song together. Even as recently as the band’s last album, 2019’s guest-heavy I Am Easy to Find, the pairing might have come as a shock. But there it was when the National announced their latest collection, First Two Pages of Frankenstein: an opener featuring their old pal and sometimes collaborator Sufjan Stevens, two tracks featuring Phoebe Bridgers, then “The Alcott” with Swift. No matter what else happened with the group’s long-awaited comeback, this song would be an event.\n\n“The Alcott” began as a sparse piano track that Aaron Dessner gave to front man Matt Berninger. After Berninger wrote a vocal, Dessner thought about sending it to his friend and folklore collaborator. He anxiously waited 20 minutes for her to reply, thinking he might have put her in a position where she would have to turn him down. Instead, she sent him a voice note with a fully formed contribution — her vocals wrapped around Berninger’s and new lyrics changing the angle of the song. The band built up an arrangement and finished it from there.\n\n“The Alcott” is one of the most beautiful moments on First Two Pages of Frankenstein, but it also feels like a rupture in reality. This is not like past National features, in which you might have to strain to hear other (quite notable) names such as Sharon Van Etten somewhere in the layers of a song. When Swift’s voice enters, it’s unmistakable and far from buried in the mix. Initially, she follows Berninger’s existing melody, but when they get to the chorus, she swoops around him. What starts as a National song by the end (almost) sounds like Swift’s while still cohering as a proper duet.\n\nAhead of First Two Pages of Frankenstein’s arrival, we called up Dessner to talk about how the song came to be and how his work with Swift has impacted the National.\n\nHow finished was the song when you sent it to Taylor? How much rearranging happened after she contributed her part? \nIt was in the late stage of making First Two Pages of Frankenstein. We had so much music we had been working on. There were, like, 25 ideas. To be honest, it wasn’t the kind of song we intended to write for the record. We had been making a lot of other things — up-tempo or loud rock songs. This was more my version of a Leonard Cohen or a Nick Cave song. Then Matt wrote this beautiful song to it, and it suddenly felt like this might be the one I could share with Taylor.\n\nWe hadn’t even talked about inviting her to be on the record, partially because no one was on the record at that point and, also, I never want to put pressure on anybody unless it really makes sense. But there was something about that song I thought she’d really respond to. She quickly rewrote it as this conversation or dialogue between two lovers. That helped shape where we went with the production of it. We added a lot of the other elements — the orchestration and the drums. We always experiment and try a lot of things. I think when she first heard it, it was just piano and Matt.\n\nHad you gone into the studio thinking about asking her to contribute something? \nWe’ve been collaborating so consistently since folklore that I think it’s natural. She loves the National and had heard a lot of what we were working on. I’d send it to her. I wasn’t openly saying, “I’d love if you could do something,” and she wasn’t saying that either. It’d just depend on the song. Before I sent it to her, I talked to Matt, and he agreed it might be the one to see if she had ideas.\n\nThere’s a long history of the National opening up to other people and benefiting from it. Back to even the very beginning of the band, there’s always been these other people who influence us and help solve riddles. It was like that. You’re lucky when you happen to have a friend who is one of the greatest songwriters ever — and fast.\n\nThe National are no strangers to collaborations. I often perceive it as being one more texture in very dense arrangements. Then on I Am Easy to Find, you went in the other direction, and there were a few songs where Matt ceded lead-vocal duties entirely. This strikes me as a first: a straight-up duet with Taylor’s touch being very prominent.\nThere’s a clarity in her ideation and her lyricism and her sense of melody. It cuts like a knife. Compositionally, it’s very intentional. Her countermelodies in the chorus and the bridge — it’s like two lovers almost talking over each other. It’s something that’s much bolder than someone singing along or just harmonizing. That is her gift: She has a storyteller’s mind and a musical sense of boldness.\n\nSomething about her phrasing … you can hear it even in the original voice note. She’s not coloring it in; she’s fully another character in the story. It makes sense. In the verse, Matt is talking about finding someone and they’re writing in their golden notebook. In a way, I was like, Is that Taylor? Who is it? Or is it some fictional character? She inhabits this story as her own character. That makes it a true feature.\n\nThis is not the first time they sang together — he was on “coney island” on evermore**. She sang on a song from your other band, Big Red Machine, in 2021. Was bringing her into the National’s world different than those other collaborations? Were you more nervous?**\nI wouldn’t say I was more nervous. It does feel like the National is this dysfunctional band of brothers, and I feel like my and Taylor’s work has been much more focused. Big Red Machine is not a typical band dynamic. But in another way, the whole reason I know Taylor is the National and her being a fan. It felt very natural. I think we’re one of her favorite bands, and she has inspired us.\n\nThis is the first time you’re doing a National album after folklore and evermore. Having spent that time in her world, did that experience change your ambition with the National? Did it make you think about what else might be possible with the band? \nWe all went away from it for a long time. I did all this work. I really had such an amazing experience and learned so much. I think, coming back to the National, there was a feeling that everyone was leaning in in a different way, because we were missing it and also because we were appreciating each other. It was a difficult time during the pandemic. To find the thread again … Taylor had said this. Around the time we were working, she was asking me about the National and I was saying, “I don’t know where we are.” She kind of predicted we’d come back and lean on each other and make our best record.\n\nThat’s, to me, how it feels. All the DNA of the band, and some future version of it, the evolution of it — it’s in there. People always debate our records. No matter what, we have collections of ugly ducklings. We’re never going to write a perfect rock song. We’re never going to do the thing we set out to do. All we can do is this uncovering of these awkward songs. They grow on us and grow on other people. It takes a while to hear them, and that’s what makes them special. They feel sculptural eventually, but when we first do it, it’s like, Are we even a good band? [Laughs.] I feel really proud of it, and I feel like we did benefit from things we learned with other people, but I also think the well filled up again and we had a lot of creative energy.\n\nI think the song is one of the most striking, exciting moments on the album, but it also seems like it has the potential to be quite divisive within your fan base. Was that ever a conversation — whether it might be too much for the record and should be a stand-alone single or something instead?\nIn the beginning of the National, the ’90s-era indie bands we idolized … you can’t imagine Pavement or somebody back then collaborating across the pop sphere. But I think that’s changed so radically. Like Taylor, she’s more hands-on and craft oriented than anyone I’ve ever met. I never felt like she was a major-label superstar. Working with her was not unlike working with an indie artist. In actual fact, she’s one of the biggest artists in the world, but the connections and musical chemistry that were organically there make it work and make it make sense. Yeah, it’s great to think her fans might hear our band. I know a lot of our fans fell in love with her music.\n\n\n\nUpvote\n77\n\nDownvote\n\nAward\n\nShare\nShare\n\nSampleswift\n•\n1y ago\nemoji:fearless2021: Fearless (Taylor's Version)\nPart 2 (due to 10,000 character limit)\n\nI’m personally tired of that feeling, indie or alternative — it doesn’t mean anything anymore. A lot of my favorite music is on giant labels. Some indie labels operate like major labels now. It’s a blurry thing. If someone’s making something authentic and is an amazing artist, I would appreciate and collaborate with them regardless of genre walls. I know certain parts of our fan base will maybe … it’s the same thing as our records: It’s never going to be what everybody wants. We have no interest in that. And honestly, it kind of bugs us sometimes. Nobody’s resistant to any of the guests, but I think sometimes people would love it if we’d make exactly the kind of record they want to hear. But the only kind of record we can make is what the five of us manage to create and feel is compelling.\n\nIt took us a little while to figure this interview out. It seemed there was a bit of an aversion to focusing on the Taylor song. I was curious — was there a concern of preserving the mystery of it ahead of release? Or a worry it could overshadow the rest of the album? You’ve set up a comeback era, talking about First Two Pages as an “ultimate” National album. Then a Taylor Swift duet is a pretty loud headline.\nOnly in the sense of like … she is by far the biggest artist that’s part of the record. It’s important to allow the record to be itself and hear the song in context. Of course we had to be careful to not let it leak. It’s just the reality of her life; people constantly try to get her one way or another. Any shred of information about her is catnip for the media. The glare can be quite intense, so as a friend, we do try to be really sensitive to how much, and in what ways, we shine that light. With this song, it made more sense to let it be part of the whole record rather than pulling it out and being like, “Here’s the Taylor song.”\n\nYou mentioned an abundance of music, including more rock-oriented songs. You guys also talked about releasing a double record at one point, before tailoring it down to this incarnation.\nThere’s at least another record’s worth of album-quality songs. Most of them are as good as anything on this record. We will do something with the other material. You can hear bits of it, like “Eucalyptus” or “Grease in Your Hair.” You think it’s going to be rock, or somebody will say something, but in reality it’ll be quite different. It’ll go to a different emotional place. We sound like ourselves, you know what I mean?",

      "Transcript/Content": "Matty Healy's model ex 'blindsided' by Taylor Swift romance just weeks after split\nMatty Healy has been spotted at a number of Taylor Swift's Eras tour gigs since they went public, but their romance was a shock for ex-girlfriend Meredith Mickelson\n\nMatty Healy’s model ex-girlfriend Meredith Mickelson was “blindsided” when he went public with Taylor Swift just four weeks after they split up.\n\nAnd the heartbroken 23-year-old told her pals: “I hope he treats her better than he treated me.”\n\nThe 1975 star Matty, 34, was still dating Meredith in February when he spent several days at a Los Angeles recording studio with Taylor, 33.\n\nThe London-born rocker even stayed at Meredith’s house during the trip Stateside, returning there each night after the music sessions.\n\nBut sources said last night that Meredith had “no idea” Matty and Taylor were growing closer.\n\nFriends revealed that during his time in the US earlier this year, Matty wanted to “hole up” with Meredith at her home and seemed reluctant to go out in public with her.\n\nInstead, he encouraged pals to come to them.\n\nBut Meredith did not see this as a red flag, and their relationship continued until late March.\n\nA source close to her said: “She did not see this coming at all. All the time Matty was in the studio with Taylor, she thought nothing of it. He’d spend the day in the studio and then come home to her.\n\n“Things were going well until around March 29 then, out of the blue, he stopped replying to messages and calls.\n\n“He just ghosted her and that was it. Then, four weeks later, he went public with Taylor.\n\n“She was totally blindsided and, of course, it has stung her a bit. She doesn’t want to play the victim and has no intention of saying anything publicly.\n\n\"But those of us in her inner circle who she has confided in are quite angry about how he treated her, and feel that he is not a good guy.\n\n\"His reluctance to be seen out and about with her in February now appears in a very different light.”\n\nUS superstar Taylor and singer Matty – who have known each other since 2014 – went public with their relationship on May 6 when he supported Taylor during her Eras Tour in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nShe mouthed on stage, “This is about you… you know who you are. I love you” – echoing an on stage comment Matty had previously made.\n\nThe pair are said to have been planning their coming out moment for “a few weeks” after news leaked on April 8 – Matty’s 34th birthday – that Taylor had split from her boyfriend of six years and rumoured fiancé, actor Joe Alwyn.\n\nIn an interview three days later, Matty referred repeatedly to “eras” in an apparent nod to the multi-BRIT and Grammy Award winner’s tour title.\n\nMatty, whose dad is Benidorm actor Tim Healy, 71, said: “Everything happens in eras. The 1975 is a very eras band. The era of me being a f***ing a***hole is coming to an end.”\n\nAnd since going public, Taylor – who met Matty’s mum, ITV’s Loose Women star Denise Welch, backstage in January – and The 1975 star have put on a very united front.\n\nHe has become a regular fixture backstage on her tour, and the couple were seen leaving New York’s Electric Lady Studios hand-in-hand on Thursday.\n\nMeredith’s pal insisted she has no bad blood with the Shake It Off singer.\n\nThe friend said: “Meredith is actually a big fan of Taylor’s – she’s posted her songs on TikTok in the past.\n\n“She respects her as a strong, independent and talented woman and she has no interest in bad-mouthing her. Her attitude is very much, ‘It is what it is’, and she hopes Matty is in love with her enough to treat her well.”\n\nTaylor’s romance with former heroin addict Matty makes him the fifth Brit she has been in a relationship with.\n\nAs well as Joe, she has previously dated former One Direction singer Harry Styles, 29, Scottish DJ and musician Calvin Harris, 39, and The Night Manager star Tom Hiddleston, 42.\n\nThe outspoken feminist, who has sold more than 120 million records worldwide, is well known for penning songs about her break-ups.\n\nShe famously wrote Style about Harry after their 2012 fling.\n\nTaylor went on to date Calvin for 15 months but they split in 2016 and weeks later, she was seen kissing Tom.\n\nThe actor was then spotted wearing an “I heart T.S.” T-shirt – prompting Taylor to use dancers wearing the same T-shirts in her video for revenge track, Look What You Made Me Do.\n\nIn 2010, she also dated Brokeback Mountain actor Jake Gyllenhaal, 42, and has been linked to Twilight heartthrob star Taylor Lautner, 31.\n\nIn 2017, she started dating Joe, 32, – who had writing credits on her albums Midnights, Evermore and Folklore under the name William Bowery.\n\nThe pair moved in together in Hampstead, North London, and were said to have got engaged last year.\n\nBut last month, it emerged they had broken up in February.\n\nMatty split from singer-songwriter FKA Twigs, 35, after three years last June.\n\nIn December, he was linked to Canadian model Charlotte Briar D’Alessio, 25.\n\nWhen approached for comment last night, a representative for Meredith said: “It is Matty who should have to explain himself on these matters, not Meredith.”\n\nRepresentatives for Matty and Taylor both declined to comment.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Jake Owen Says Rumors Taylor Swift's 'Sparks Fly' Is About Him Are 'Funny': 'She's an Amazing Girl' (Exclusive)\n\"I'm happy to even have my name in the discussion around it,\" the country singer said\nDrop everything now — Jake Owen is addressing the rumors that Taylor Swift’s “Sparks Fly” is about him.\n\nThe country star doesn’t seem to mind that many people think he's the subject of one of Swift’s 2010 hit songs, as fans revisit the theory amid the release of Speak Now (Taylor’s Version). Owen, now 41, tells PEOPLE that he has heard the theory for years — but it's never bothered him.\n\n“It’s a great song and the speculation has always been funny to me,” admits Owen, speaking to PEOPLE Wednesday at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course in South Lake Tahoe, Nevada, where he was participating in the American Century Championship. “I’m sure Taylor probably laughs at it all too, but I’m happy to even have my name in the discussion around it.”\n\nThe singer-songwriter — who released his own latest album, Loose Cannon, on June 23 — went on to say that he has “known Taylor since she was 16,” and he has always been a fan of her work.\n\n“She’s an amazing girl and an amazing artist,” Owen says, adding, “It’s been incredible to see how she’s grown as a musician and what a global phenomenon she’s become.”\n\nThe “Midnights” singer, 33, hasn’t shared much about her inspiration behind the track, but fans have pieced together the theory based on past comments and “Easter eggs” Swift often leaves for her followers to look for.\n\nIn the song’s liner notes, she wrote “Portland, OR,” possibly hinting at the city she and Owen played in together 17 years ago. Fans also tracked down an old MySpace post from October 2006, about a year before Swift started performing the song live, in which she recalled an “amazing” night playing in a Portland bar called Duke’s when she opened Owen's show.\n\nShe detailed meeting Owen that night, where he told her he was a fan of her music. Fans took that as a clue that the two might’ve stayed to chat, and that's why the lyrics in “Sparks Fly” refer to “falling in love in an empty bar.”\nA loose concept album about the times she wishes she had spoken up, Swift previously teased to Songwriter Universe magazine that each song is meant to serve as “a different confession to a different person.”\nThe 12-time Grammy winner sparked years-old conversation about the people behind her songs when she released her re-recorded version of her third album — originally released in 2010. Swift’s third album was largely inspired by her growth as a person and artist as she entered adulthood. \n\n“I first made Speak Now, completely self-written, between the ages of 18 and 20,” Swift wrote on Instagram when she announced Speak Now (Taylor’s Version). \n\n“The songs that came from this time in my life were marked by their brutal honesty, unfiltered diaristic confessions and wild wistfulness. I love this album because it tells a tale of growing up, flailing, flying and crashing … and living to speak about it.” ",

This is one of those moments.\n\nOn Monday, April 27, 2009, a 19-year-old Taylor Swift went out in Lawrence while visiting her best friend, Abigail Anderson, a swimmer at KU.\n\nThis is the story of the night the biggest pop star in the world went to The Jayhawk Cafe, aka “The Hawk,” as told by the students who were there that night.\n\nComments have been edited for clarity\n\nJustin Pessetto, KU football player and Hawk doorman: We just weren’t busy, so I’m like ‘Well I’ll just work the door tonight,” — and then someone said, “Hey, I think Taylor Swift is gonna come in.”\n\nDakota Lewis, KU football player: Pessetto was working that night, so we got word that it was gonna go down.\n\nTyler Lawrence, KU football player: Her friend (Abigail) was a swimmer and all that. The athletes, we all run in the same circles. We heard Taylor Swift was gonna go to the Hawk, and we were all like, ‘Wait what? No way. If this is gonna be a real thing, we gotta go check this out.’ There’s no way you’re going to pass up this opportunity.\n\nAnonymous college friend of Abigail: She texted and said, “We’re gonna do a little get together at The Hawk, down in the Martini Room.” I think Taylor wanted to meet people.\n\nJaclyn McAnarney, KU cheerleader: It started going around via text. Through the football players, we got a text that there was an exclusive list. You had to be on a list.\n\nLewis: I don’t think it was campus-wide knowledge that Taylor Swift was going to the Hawk.\n\nPessetto (doorman): I was just posted up on the door that night, not supposed to let anybody in. Only these people were on her list and that was it.\n\nEditor’s Note: The list may have had a few exceptions.\n\nLawrence: We got let in. Pessetto being my best friend, that was a no brainer. So I got to go in.\n\nPessetto (doorman): I got the whole rundown, like ‘you’ll give her the wristband [to get in], and then I was just sitting there casually waiting.\n\nSwift arrives at the Hawk and, like everyone else, needs a wristband to get inside. The famous picture gets taken during this moment.\n\nLawrence: It wasn’t like a big crowd, or mob. It was just a subtle handful of people.\n\nPessetto (doorman): Everything must’ve just gone silent. I don’t remember commotion.\n\nLewis: It was just us hanging outside of the Hawk, nothing crazy. And she just casually walked up.\n\nPessetto (doorman): Up strolls the six-footer herself. I was just blown away. This is Taylor Swift, as advertised. She was just casually coming through acting like a regular co-ed in Lawrence.\n\nEditor’s Note: After years of the photo floating around, Pessetto requested the record reflect that he was sitting on a barstool in the photo and that Swift is NOT taller than him. He mentioned this multiple times.\n\nLawrence: I remember thinking: God damn she’s tall. She’s pretty. Wow, she’s really here. This is a really cool opportunity.\n\nLewis: There she is. She’s here at the Cafe.\n\nPessetto (doorman): I was blown away by her majesticness. It was like a special mallard, you just don’t ever see them again.\n\nEditor’s Note: I have no idea what this means, but it was funny.\n\nLewis: It was just like, ‘Oh, that’s Taylor Swift. OK cool.’ And then she was greeted by Sir Justin Pessetto, pulling the typical Chris Farely introduction to her.\n\nPessetto (doorman): I didn’t even ID her. There were no IDs given. Like, what are you gonna take Taylor Swift’s ID for? You know she’s not 21. Like, why would I even pretend to do that. I was strictly there to put a wristband on her. I asked her ‘How’s your day with Abigail been?’\n\nShe said ‘It’s been fun.’\n\nI said, ‘Good, I hope you enjoy your time at the Jayhawk Cafe. You need anything, you let me know. There’s probably a lot of people here to help you.’ And then she just went on her way. She was gone.\n\nLewis: It’s comical. That’s 100% something Pessetto would say, straight faced, just typical.\n\nPessetto: I got to brush up against her for that two-and-a-half seconds of just pure joy.\n\nSwift went into one of the Hawk’s five bar areas, the Martini Room\n\nMcAnarney: I remember them saying, ‘Listen, everyone gets autographs, pictures, whatever for 15 minutes.’ And then put away your cameras and let her be a college student.\n\nLewis: I was just a dirty hippie going to Kansas playing football. I had a flip phone. That was my least worry to get a pixelated picture with Taylor Swift.\n\nAnonymous college friend of Abigail: I always got the feeling she just wanted to, like, have a normal experience. We introduced ourselves and everybody was trying to ignore the elephant in the room. She was really sweet.\n\nLewis: She was just there to be with her friend and experience a little bit of college life.\n\nLawrence: We all just kind of hung out and chatted. There wasn’t like crazy dancing or shots. We were just enjoying the moment, I guess.\n\nMcAnarney: Obviously a lot of the football boys were talking to her.\n\nLewis: We all got to say hello and introduce ourselves. At some point we spoke a little bit more, just with a group of people. She was just in the group, keeping conversation going and whatnot. It was a pretty casual conversation.\n\nMcAnarney: I didn’t want to crowd her, so we waited our turn. I saw a little opening and asked for a quick pic. She said ‘absolutely!’ and was really sweet.\n\nPasetto: I don’t even know if she drank.\n\nMcAnarney: I never saw her drinking at all.\n\nLewis: She wasn’t drinking. \n\nLawrence: There were a lot of $100 bills passed around to let people in at some point.\n\nAnonymous friend: I think she kind of got overwhelmed and they left pretty quick.\n\nLawrence: I remember a big flash (photo) and everything kind of got shut down at that point.\n\nPasetto: For us at the bar, we were just like, ‘Wow, that really happened. Taylor Swift was in the Martini Room.’\n\nAnd just like that, Swift was gone. Five months later, Kanye West interrupted her acceptance speech at the MTV VMAs. Her stardom continued to take off and hasn’t slowed down since.\n\nFor those few at the Hawk that night, it made for a KU memory that would last forever.\n\n\nMcAnarney and Swift in the Martini Room\n\nMcAnarney: You didn’t really know about it until the next day once people were able to upload their photos [to Facebook]. I definitely got tons of comments.\n\nPesetto: I remember leaving that night saying ‘we’ll be telling that story to our kids.’ And yeah, here we are.\n\nLawrence: Looking back, it’s like, “Holy shit. That was really cool.” You don’t fully appreciate what you’re experiencing in that moment.\n\nPesetto: Every time Swift pops up in Kansas City, I get like 1,000 text messages asking if it’s me in the picture. It’s been a recurring thing for the past 10 years.\n\nLewis: [The picture] comes up once a year, if not more. It always gets brought up somewhere.\n\nLawrence: I get sent that picture every year, somehow. It’s been going on for years.\n\nLewis: My wife makes fun of me. She’s like, ‘yeah, you showed me that picture 10 years ago.’\n\nPesetto: My wife is a 5’11” gal. I wanted a tall girl and Taylor Swift was one of those reasons. On God. When I meant my wife, I was like, ‘This is my Taylor Swift.’\n\nLawrence: My daughter is like the biggest Swiftie of all time. We know all the songs… and she loves the picture.",

      "Transcript/Content": "“It’s a nice song,” Liles said of the track. “It’s like the nicest song you could write about somebody, so that was cool.” \n\nSwift has a history of never naming the subjects of her music — but her first five albums included secret liner notes that provided a glimpse into her inspiration. When Fearless was released, eagle-eyed fans quickly discovered that “Hey Stephen’s” code spelled out “Love and Theft.” \n\nIn a 2008 interview with CMT Radio Live, Swift played coy about the track but revealed that she wrote “Hey Stephen” as a way to express her admiration for “Stephen,” saying, “It’s just like a little musical wink to the guy that I thought was cute … I think that guy’s really cute.”\n\nLiles later confirmed the song was penned about him — and that he heard the track before the Fearless release. \n\n“Me and Taylor really hit it off and became really close when we were on tour together,” Liles told Taste of Country in 2011. “We had a real emotional relationship. We talked on the phone a lot. She was really cool. One day she called me up and was like, ‘Hey, I wrote a song about you.’” \n\nThe musician recalled finding the news “funny” because he had written a song about Swift the week prior. \n\n“She was like, ‘Really!’ She asked how it went and I told her about some of the lines,” he recalled. “I didn’t tell her too much, but I told her about the main tag of the song. She was like, ‘I want to hear it!'”\n\nLove and Theft’s hectic tour schedule kept Liles from recording and sending the song to Swift at the time — “I never really did anything with it,” he told Taste of Country — but the band laid down a raw version of the song, titled “Try to Make It Anyway,” while writing their self-titled fourth album in 2011.\n\n“This is actually one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever written,” Liles shared at the time. “[Taylor] is awesome. I really dig Taylor. I dig what her and her family have done with her career, and I dig the person she is. I hope she’s flattered by it. As far as I know, none of the other dudes she’s been hanging out with have written a song about her.” ",

Shepard’s powerful vocals and soulful melodies touched millions — including, it seems, a young Taylor Swift.\n\nShepard recently shared on Instagram that Swift covered her 1989 ballad, “Baby, Don’t You Break My Heart Slow.” 1989 notably marks the year Swift was born as well as the name of her upcoming re-recorded album, which drops Oct. 27.\n\n\n\"Were you today years old when you found out that @taylorswift covered a Vonda Shepard song? It’s true!\" Shepard captioned a post Oct. 19.\n\nOn her Instagram story, Shepard also posted a link to a YouTube clip of Swift’s karaoke-style version. \n\n“It’s really sweet and heartfelt,” Shepard, 60, tells TODAY.com. \"You can hear how young she was.\"\n\nThe cover, shortened to \"Baby,\" was released as part of Swift's 2006 three-song album \"Napster Live\" and is exclusive to the music platform.\n\nShepard says Swift, now 33, was around 11 when she attended one of the singer's shows with her parents, Scott and Andrea.\n\n“Taylor was a big fan and and apparently my music inspired her to write her own songs, which is very cool,” she says.\n\nIt’s not surprising that Swift, the breakup anthem queen, chose to record “Baby, Don’t You Break My Heart Slow,” which is about ghosting. Lyrics include “I’d rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye / I’d rather take the blow / At least then I would know.”\n\n“It’s a very Taylor song, right?” Shepard says, with a laugh. \"Like, tell me what's going on and don't mess with me.\"\n\nTODAY.com has reached out to representatives for Swift for comment.\n\nShepard, like Swift, was a little girl when she realized what she wanted to do with the rest of her life. \n\n“I started making demos when I was 9 years old, and I’ve been playing clubs since the age of 14,” she says, noting that there are “definitely some parallels” between herself and Swift.\n\nRecommended\n\nBeauty\nExperts share their tips for managing dry hair, plus their favorite products\n\nShop - On the Show\nThese will be the top trends of 2025, according to an expert\nSwift was 11 when she convinced her parents to take her to Nashville, Tennessee, with hopes of landing a recording contract.\n\n“My mom waited in the car with my little brother while I knocked on doors up and down Music Row,” Swift said while speaking with Entertainment Weekly in 2008. “I would say, ‘Hi, I’m Taylor. I’m 11. I want a record deal — call me.’”\n\nShepard, who is on tour promoting her new album, \"Red Light, Green Light,\" says Swift should call her about recording a studio version of “Baby, Don’t You Break My Heart Slow.\"\n\n“That would just be amazing,” she says.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift and Diane Warren Wrote ‘Say Don’t Go’ 9 Years Ago. She Still Thinks It’s a ‘F-cking Hit’\n\nWhen Taylor Swift dropped 1989 in 2014, Diane Warren wondered why the song they wrote together, “Say Don’t Go,” didn’t make it on the LP’s tracklist. So when the famed songwriter heard from her lawyer that Swift would finally release it nearly 10 years later, she was surprised — and more than ready.\n\n“Everything has its time, you know? It took a while to see the light of day, but I’m glad it finally did,” Warren tells Rolling Stone. “It was worth the wait.”\n\nWarren, who typically writes on her own, says the two of them “sat down and wrote the song,” which was released Friday as one of 1989 (Taylor’s Version)‘s vault tracks, “from scratch” during the last few days of 2013. She remembers being impressed with how specific Swift was with her lyricism and how considerate she was about how her fans might receive it.\n\n“She was very particular about how she said certain things. It was a really interesting experience. She gets her audience,” Warren says. “She’s deeply aware of how her fans want to hear something. I can’t explain it, but that’s probably why she’s the biggest fucking star in the world.”\n\nSeveral days after writing the song together, they got into Warren’s office to record a demo, where Swift played it on her acoustic guitar. “We demoed it on New Year’s Day. And I’m a workaholic, and that’s fine for me,” she says. “But I remember being impressed that she did, too. Everybody’s on vacation, but she showed up.”\n\n“I was curious what they would do with the record,” she adds. “And I assume it’s Jack Antonoff who produced the shit out of the song.”\n\nWarren says she was emailed the song just a few hours before it was released on Friday while at dinner with friends. She says she went outside to listen to the song. “I said, ‘Oh my god, this is fucking awesome,'” she says. “It was such a surprise to me that the record version was as good as it was. You know what? I hope they release this as a single because I think it’s a fucking hit.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "From Songwriter to Star \nTAYLOR TALES:\n*Part 1/2\n“I learned a long time ago - never doubt the power of Taylor Swift.” - Scott Borchetta\nGOLD RUSH.\n\nTaylor Swift is a billionaire. Thanks to her ERAS tour and concert film, she's one of the richest self-made women in the U.S.A.\n\nSTRAIGHT UP SONGS,\nNO SIDE HUSTLE.\n\nShe’s one of the few entertainers to reach this status based on income from music alone. (Sans beauty brands, clothing lines, branded bars, restaurants, or beverages.) She's become a billionaire by making songs.\n\nFEARLESS.\n\nI can’t say I’m surprised. She’s earned it. Anyone who ever sat in a writing room with her could see this coming. I worked with Taylor several times early on when we were both just starting out. She always knew what she wanted and she had something many do not:\n\nA SINGULAR FOCUS.\n\n\nPhoto: Trey Strange\n\nLONG STORY SHORT.\n\nThe first write we did was in the Sony Firehouse on Music Row. I had just signed to Sony UK, and Taylor was one of my first cowrites I did for the Nashville office. I was in my mid-twenties at the time. She was 15.\n\nWILDEST DREAMS.\n\nLike most teen songwriters, she was still learning how to sing and find her way around the guitar, but Taylor didn't let that stop her. She had big ideas - and those are worth more than anything.\n\nShe brought titles, concepts and strong opinions. She knew how to say no to what didn’t fit her vision and she didn’t waste time. There wasn't a lot of chit-chat and no distractions.  I was blown away by her certainty. It took me years to learn that. She was truly...\n\nREADY FOR IT.\n\nWe wrote that first song fast; two girls, two guitars, and one true story. We wrote a song about her real life with a great title - that she brought in.\n\nWe made a one-take work tape using a basic laptop recording app. (It was 2004, three years before the iPhone’s debut.) The recording starts out with her laughing and me saying “This is Jodi and Taylor and she’s gonna sing us a good one.\"\n\nIndeed.\n\nANDREA.\n\nTaylor’s mom had dropped her off that morning, then ran some errands. She got back right on time then waited in the lobby until we were done. She was smiling and sweet and stayed in the background. She did that every time we worked together.\n\nShe was no momager. That was refreshing. She was still mama bird, though - met every co-writer when Taylor did, shook every hand - making sure her daughter was with good people. Taylor knew her family had her back and that they believed in her dreams.\n\nBELIEVE IT CAN BE DONE.\n\nThat was key. Like Taylor, they believed beyond a doubt. The gatekeepers who connected us called her \"tween talent\" and \"cute country.\" She knew better. So did I. It was obvious how driven she was, and how far ahead she was thinking - even then.\n\nHer parents believed enough to move to Nashville and invest financially and personally in their daughter’s talent, and Taylor worked hard to make it all worth it.\n\nHer confidence was obvious. Her vision was clear. Her focus was intense. Her work ethic was beyond her years. She was relentless in the pursuit of her future.\n\nThat’s what it takes. No less.\n\nSee you next week for my Taylor Tales Part 2.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Diane Warren was \"really surprised\" to see Taylor Swift bring back their decade-old song, \"Say Don't Go,\" for 1989 (Taylor's Version) — and she's buzzing about it.\n\nOn Thursday, the songwriter, 67, revealed to PEOPLE what it was like to see the song find a new life. She also shared her reaction to the music superstar's decision to send her flowers in October, following the release of her fourth re-recorded album.\n\n\"I was surprised that that became a news story. I mean, what? That was really nice of her. But that shows, she's smart, she's smarter than everybody. That was really beautiful,\" Warren tells PEOPLE at the 2023 Variety Power of Women event in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Look, it was great that the song came out and everybody loves that song, everybody. It's like her fan's favorite song,\" Warren continues. \"And the fact that she used it now when she's bigger than anybody on the planet, it's like, thanks for taking me along for the ride, Taylor. It's awesome.\"\n\nAs for writing the song with the pop star, Warren — who has previously penned hits, such as Aerosmith's \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\" and Cher's \"If I Could Turn Back Time\" — called the overall experience \"interesting.\"\n\n\"Just the way we wrote together was very interesting. I loved the song at the time and then I was kind of surprised that she didn't use it,\" she says of Swift, 33. \"And then really surprised in a way better way when I found [out] she was.\"\n\nWarren previously opened up about the process of collaborating on the Swiftie favorite, telling Rolling Stone that the pair sat down in 2013 to write the ballad \"from scratch.\"\n\nThe songwriter also remembered that Swift was \"very particular about how she said certain things\" in the recording process, and that she was \"deeply aware of how her fans want to hear something.\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n Taylor Swift Says Re-Recording 'Bad Blood' Remix with Kendrick Lamar Felt 'Surreal and Bewildering'\nThe final song was eventually released as part of the 1989 rerecording, and was co-produced by Swift and Jack Antonoff. It was featured as one of five \"From the Vault\" tracks that appeared on the album.\n\n\"Everything has its time, you know? It took a while to see the light of day, but I’m glad it finally did,\" Warren told the publication. \"It was worth the wait.\"\n\nAs for the white flowers that Swift sent her co-writer's way, Warren shared a photo of the sweet gift to X (formerly known as Twitter) in October.\n\nShe wrote in the caption: \"If U want to know why she is the biggest artist on the planet, this kind of kind and classy gesture is one more reason why.\"\n\nThe image also featured a note that Swift wrote to Warren, reading, “Diane, It was a dream come true to write with you. I hope you love ‘Say Don't Go’ as much as I do!! Sending the biggest hug to you! Love, Taylor.”\n\nMost recently the 14-time Oscar nominee made a cameo in the Eva Longoria-directed music video (that dropped Friday) for Becky G's \"The Fire Inside,\" a track Warren wrote that's featured in Flamin' Hot.\n\n“I’ve known Diane for years, long before I ever got the job to direct Flamin’ Hot, and she’s always been adamant that she would write a song for my movie,” said Longoria in a release. “She is a genius, and I was so lucky to receive such a kind offer. When I made the film, she was one of the first people to see it, and instantly had a vision for the perfect song to compliment Richard’s story. To have a Chicana like Becky G help bring it to life and for me to join them on set for this video has been a dream come true.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift's Cowriter Aaron Dessner Recalls Her 'Cooking Everyone Breakfast and Dinner' at Her Home (Exclusive)\nAaron Dessner opens up his collaborations and friendship with Taylor Swift as she covers PEOPLE's 2023 Most Intriguing People of the Year issue\n\nBy Rachel DeSantis  Published on December 5, 2023 02:05PM EST\n\nAfter seven country and pop albums, Taylor Swift embraced a folkier era in 2020 with the help of Aaron Dessner, a founding member of indie rock band The National. With the releases of Folklore and Evermore, Swift found an enlightening producer and songwriting partner in Dessner, 47, expanding her sound and lyrical universe to critical acclaim and commercial success. Now, in honor of Swift, 33, gracing the cover of PEOPLE's 2023 Most Intriguing People of the Year issue, Dessner dives deep on their friendship, future, and Swift's passion for baking.\n\nWhat do you admire most about Taylor's artistry and songwriting?\nI think Taylor is one of the greatest songwriters of all time. The poetic and literary bent of her lyricism, where songs often have elaborately woven narratives and hidden meanings that connect to her earlier or future work, what her fans call \"easter eggs,\" helps to create an entire artistic world that we all get to inhabit and obsess over as her fans. I love the sense of belonging that this creates in Taylor's music, where joy, overcoming adversity, shattering patriarchal structures and celebrating diversity are so prevalent as themes. She is an absolute genius and thankfully also a truly wonderful human being.\n\nThe Reign of Taylor Swift! The Pop Superstar Tops PEOPLE's 2023 Most Intriguing People of the Year List\nDo you have any memories from the studio or a writing session that stick out to you as an example of just why Taylor is so good at her craft?\nThere are so many stories I could share. When I sent Taylor the music for our song \"Willow\" — I think she wrote the entire song from start to finish in less than 10 minutes and sent it back to me. It was like an earthquake. Then Taylor said, \"I guess we are making another album.\"\n\nYou met back in 2014, but you have said that 1989 was the first album you really listened to as a fan. What about it drew you in?\nI think 1989 is a perfect pop record and I used to have so much fun blasting it. I was drawn in by hearing \"Blank Space\" on the radio and just feeling like it was an impossibly perfect pop song. Once I heard the entire record I remember just sensing that Taylor was some kind of incredibly rare unicorn of a singer and songwriter.\n\nTaylor Swift and Aaron Dessner perform onstage during \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" at Raymond James Stadium on April 14, 2023 in Tampa, Florida.\nTaylor Swift and Aaron Dessner performing in Tampa in April on the Eras Tour. OCTAVIO JONES/TAS23/GETTY\nAre there any anecdotes that come to mind that speak to Taylor's work ethic, and how she's able to balance everything from re-records to concerts to award shows to her daily life?\nTaylor is the hardest working artist I've ever encountered. She is involved in every aspect of writing and producing her songs and has an incredible attention span and focus on detail. And she never really stops writing songs. The world has seen her play 44 songs a night on tour now, performing for over three hours. She makes it look easy but it's really a feat of incredible endurance. It's hard to think of an example of someone who matches that kind of output, except maybe Bruce Springsteen, but he doesn't have to cover as much ground as Taylor does up there.\n\nSimilarly, I've spent a lot of time with her and I've never seen anyone wait on her. When I have stayed at her house, Taylor herself was cooking everyone breakfast and dinner. She's legitimately just a very down to earth and hardworking person.\n\nWhen you wrote Folklore and Evermore, it was peak pandemic and the world was different. What's it like for you now to see those albums that were written in solitude performed for tens of thousands of people?\nIt was quite surreal to be honest. When Taylor first texted me about writing remotely with her during the pandemic, I almost didn't believe it was her at first. And then as we were working on Folklore, we had almost no outside interaction with anyone on her team or label, much less the outside world of her millions and millions of fans.\n\nTaylor never made me feel any of the shadow of her previous work or success. There was no pressure at all. It was as though we were just making an album for ourselves and passing time during the pandemic. It felt like we were on our own private artistic life raft, just making songs to soothe our souls and get through such an uncertain and difficult time.\n\nWhen the album was finally shared with the world, and that feeling became something shared cathartically with millions and millions of people around the world, it was really something I will never forget. We were on FaceTime at midnight on the night Folklore came out and the first reviews and responses started coming in and it was really one of the most exhilarating, life-affirming feelings I have ever had. The fragile songs we had made remotely during lockdown were suddenly becoming part of the fabric of so many people's lives.\n\nTaylor Swift and Aaron Dessner accept the Album of the Year award onstage during the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los\nTaylor Swift and Aaron Dessner accepting the Grammy Award for album of the year for 'Folklore' in 2021. KEVIN WINTER/GETTY \nAaron Dessner Says He 'Can't Help But Be Influenced' by Taylor Swift's Songwriting: 'So Masterful'\nYou joined her onstage for a few Eras Tour stops. What was it like backstage for you?\nIt's really hard to describe what it feel like to be raised up on a hydraulic into a stadium of 80,000 fans who have already been experiencing the best concert they have ever seen for two and a half hours, as I would join Taylor onstage towards the end of the show. But Taylor was so generous in her introductions and it's really such a special moment for us to be able to play some of these songs acoustically for her fans. It's hard to describe how exhilarating it was to play \"Would've, Could've, Should've\" in the pouring rain acoustically in Nashville.\n\nWhat's something about Taylor that people would be surprised to learn?\nMaybe it's so not so surprising, but she's a very, very good cook and a great visual artist too.\n\nTaylor Swift PEOPLE cover\nTaylor Swift on the cover of PEOPLE. PEGGY SIROTA/TRUNK ARCHIVE\nBetween Midnights and the Eras Tour, she's really at the top of her game. How do you see her evolving and growing from here?\nI think Taylor has so many stories to tell. She will keep writing better and better songs and experimenting stylistically. She sometimes jokes that she likes to change what she writes her songs with literally, sometimes it's an ink or glitter pen, or with me it's often more like a 19th-century quill. I think she'll keep inventing new ways and methods of writing and keep expanding this enchanted universe of her own making that we all get to enjoy.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift is telling me a story, and when Taylor Swift tells you a story, you listen, because you know it’s going to be good—not only because she’s had an extraordinary life, but because she’s an extraordinary storyteller. This one is about a time she got her heart broken, although not in the way you might expect.\n\nShe was 17, she says, and she had booked the biggest opportunity of her life so far—a highly coveted slot opening for country superstar Kenny Chesney on tour. “This was going to change my career,” she remembers. “I was so excited.” But a couple weeks later, Swift arrived home to find her mother Andrea sitting on the front steps of their house. “She was weeping,” Swift says. “Her head was in her hands as if there had been a family emergency.” Through sobs, Andrea told her daughter that Chesney’s tour had been sponsored by a beer company. Taylor was too young to join. “I was devastated,” Swift says. \n\nBut some months later, at Swift’s 18th birthday party, she saw Chesney’s promoter. He handed her a card from Chesney that read, as Swift recalls, “I’m sorry that you couldn’t come on the tour, so I wanted to make it up to you.” With the note was a check. “It was for more money than I’d ever seen in my life,” Swift says. “I was able to pay my band bonuses. I was able to pay for my tour buses. I was able to fuel my dreams.”\n\n\nPhotograph by Inez and Vinoodh for TIME\nListening to Swift share this, on a clear fall afternoon in her New York City apartment, I’m struck by how satisfying the story is. There are high stakes at the outset; there are details, vivid and sensory; there’s a twist that flips the action on its head; and there’s a happy ending for its hero. It takes her only about 30 seconds to recount this, but those 30 seconds contain an entire narrative world.\n\nBuy the Taylor Swift Person of the Year issue here\n\nI’m not surprised. Swift has a preternatural skill for finding the story. Her anecdote about Chesney symbolizes a larger narrative in Swift’s life, one about redemption—where our protagonist discovers new happiness not despite challenges, but because of them. Swift, as we’ll discuss, took a few hits to get here. “I’ve been raised up and down the flagpole of public opinion so many times in the last 20 years,” she says as we tuck into a cozy den off the kitchen to talk, and she kicks off her shoes and curls up onto the sofa. “I’ve been given a tiara, then had it taken away.” She is seemingly unguarded in conversation, reflective about both where she’s been and where she finds herself now. After all, while she’s long been one of the biggest entertainers in the world, this year is different. “It feels like the breakthrough moment of my career, happening at 33,” she says. “And for the first time in my life, I was mentally tough enough to take what comes with that.” This is her story—even if she’s now so high that it’s hard to believe she was ever low.\n\n\nPhotograph by Inez and Vinoodh for TIME\nSwift’s accomplishments as an artist—culturally, critically, and commercially—are so legion that to recount them seems almost beside the point. As a pop star, she sits in rarefied company, alongside Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna; as a songwriter, she has been compared to Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, and Joni Mitchell. As a businesswoman, she has built an empire worth, by some estimates, over $1 billion. And as a celebrity—who by dint of being a woman is scrutinized for everything from whom she dates to what she wears—she has long commanded constant attention and knows how to use it. (“I don’t give Taylor advice about being famous,” Stevie Nicks tells me. “She doesn’t need it.”) But this year, something shifted. To discuss her movements felt like discussing politics or the weather—a language spoken so widely it needed no context. She became the main character of the world.\n\nIf you’re skeptical, consider it: How many conversations did you have about Taylor Swift this year? How many times did you see a photo of her while scrolling on your phone? Were you one of the people who made a pilgrimage to a city where she played? Did you buy a ticket to her concert film? Did you double-tap an Instagram post, or laugh at a tweet, or click on a headline about her? Did you find yourself humming “Cruel Summer” while waiting in line at the grocery store? Did a friend confess that they watched clips of the Eras Tour night after night on TikTok? Or did you?\n\n\nPhotograph by Inez and Vinoodh for TIME\nHer epic career-retrospective tour recounting her artistic “eras,” which played 66 dates across the Americas this year, is projected to become the biggest of all time and the first to gross over a billion dollars; analysts talked about the “Taylor effect,” as politicians from Thailand, Hungary, and Chile implored her to play their countries. Cities, stadiums, and streets were renamed for her. Every time she came to a new place, a mini economic boom took place as hotels and restaurants saw a surge of visitors. In releasing her concert movie, Swift bypassed studios and streamers, instead forging an unusual pact with AMC, giving the theater chain its highest single-day ticket sales in history. There are at least 10 college classes devoted to her, including one at Harvard; the professor, Stephanie Burt, tells TIME she plans to compare Swift’s work to that of the poet William Wordsworth. Friendship bracelets traded by her fans at concerts became a hot accessory, with one line in a song causing as much as a 500% increase in sales at craft stores. When Swift started dating Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chief and two-time Super Bowl champion, his games saw a massive increase in viewership. (Yes, she somehow made one of America’s most popular things—football—even more popular.) And then there’s her critically hailed songbook—a catalog so beloved that as she rereleases it, she’s often breaking chart records she herself set. She’s the last monoculture left in our stratified world.\n\nIt’s hard to see history when you’re in the middle of it, harder still to distinguish Swift’s impact on the culture from her celebrity, which emits so much light it can be blinding. But something unusual is happening with Swift, without a contemporary precedent. She deploys the most efficient medium of the day—the pop song—to tell her story. Yet over time, she has harnessed the power of the media, both traditional and new, to create something wholly unique—a narrative world, in which her music is just one piece in an interactive, shape-shifting story. Swift is that story’s architect and hero, protagonist and narrator.\n\n\nInez and Vinoodh for TIME\nThis was the year she perfected her craft—not just with her music, but in her position as the master storyteller of the modern era. The world, in turn, watched, clicked, cried, danced, sang along, swooned, caravanned to stadiums and movie theaters, let her work soundtrack their lives. For Swift, it’s a peak. “This is the proudest and happiest I’ve ever felt, and the most creatively fulfilled and free I’ve ever been,” Swift tells me. “Ultimately, we can convolute it all we want, or try to overcomplicate it, but there’s only one question.” Here, she adopts a booming voice. “Are you not entertained?”\n\nA few months before I sit with Swift in New York, on a summer night in Santa Clara, Calif., which has been temporarily renamed Swiftie Clara in her honor, I am in a stadium with nearly 70,000 other people having a religious experience. The crowd is rapturous and Swift beatific as she gazes out at us, all high on the same drug. Her fans are singularly passionate, not just in the venue but also online, as they analyze clues, hints, and secret messages in everything from her choreography to her costumes—some deliberately planted, others not. (“Taylor Swift fans are the modern-day equivalent of those cults who would consistently have inaccurate rapture predictions like once a month,” as one viral tweet noted.)\n\nStanding in the arena, it’s not hard to understand why this is the biggest thing in the world. “Beatlemania and Thriller have nothing on these shows,” says Swift’s friend and collaborator Phoebe Bridgers. Fans in Argentina pitched tents outside the venue for months to get prime spots, with some quitting their jobs to commit to fandom full time. Across the U.S., others lined up for days, while those who didn’t get in “Taylor-gated” in nearby parking lots so they could pick up the sound. When tickets went on sale last year, Ticketmaster crashed. Although 4.1 million tickets were sold for the 2023 shows—including over 2 million on the first day, a new record—scalpers jacked up prices on the secondary market to more than $22,000. Multiple fans filed lawsuits. The Justice Department moved forward with an investigation. The Senate held a hearing. Given these stakes, Swift had to deliver.\n\n\nTicketmaster and Live Nation executives testified at a Senate hearing after demand for tickets overwhelmed the siteAl Drago—Bloomberg/Getty Images\n“I knew this tour was harder than anything I’d ever done before by a long shot,” Swift says. Each show spans over 180 minutes, including 40-plus songs from at least nine albums; there are 16 costume changes, pyrotechnics, an optical illusion in which she appears to dive into the stage and swim, and not one but two cottagecore worlds, which feature an abundance of moss.\n\nIn the past, Swift jokes, she toured “like a frat guy.” This time, she began training six months ahead of the first show. “Every day I would run on the treadmill, singing the entire set list out loud,” she said. “Fast for fast songs, and a jog or a fast walk for slow songs.” Her gym, Dogpound, created a program for her, incorporating strength, conditioning, and weights. “Then I had three months of dance training, because I wanted to get it in my bones,” she says. “I wanted to be so over-rehearsed that I could be silly with the fans, and not lose my train of thought.” She worked with choreographer Mandy Moore—recommended by her friend Emma Stone, who worked with Moore on La La Land—since, as Swift says, “Learning choreography is not my strong suit.” With the exception of Grammy night—which was “hilarious,” she says—she also stopped drinking. “Doing that show with a hangover,” she says ominously. “I don’t want to know that world.”\n\nRead More: Taylor Swift Shares Her Eras Tour Workout and Self-Care Regimen\n\nSwift’s arrival in a city energized the local economy. When Eras kicked off in Glendale, Ariz., she generated more revenue for its businesses than the 2023 Super Bowl, which was held in the same stadium. Fans flew across the country, stayed in hotels, ate meals out, and splurged on everything from sweatshirts to limited-edition vinyl, with the average Eras attendee reportedly spending nearly $1,300. Swift sees the expense and effort incurred by fans as something she needs to repay: “They had to work really hard to get the tickets,” she says. “I wanted to play a show that was longer than they ever thought it would be, because that makes me feel good leaving the stadium.” The “Taylor effect” was noticed at the highest levels of government. “When the Federal Reserve mentions you as the reason economic growth is up, that’s a big deal,” says Ed Tiryakian, a finance professor at Duke University. \n\nCarrying an economy on your back is a lot for one person. After she plays a run of shows, Swift takes a day to rest and recover. “I do not leave my bed except to get food and take it back to my bed and eat it there,” she says. “It’s a dream scenario. I can barely speak because I’ve been singing for three shows straight. Every time I take a step my feet go crunch, crunch, crunch from dancing in heels.” Maintaining her strength through workouts between shows is key. “I know I’m going on that stage whether I’m sick, injured, heartbroken, uncomfortable, or stressed,” she says. “That’s part of my identity as a human being now. If someone buys a ticket to my show, I’m going to play it unless we have some sort of force majeure.” (A heat wave in Rio de Janeiro caused chaos during Swift’s November run as one fan, Ana Clara Benevides Machado, reportedly collapsed during the show and later died; Swift wrote on Instagram that she had a “shattered heart.” She rescheduled the next show because of unsafe conditions, and spent time with Benevides Machado’s family at her final tour date in Brazil.)\n\nTaylor Swift Tour Rehearsal\nSwift told TIME she started training six months in advance of the Eras Tour, which kicked off in MarchCourtesy TAS Rights Management\nSwift is many things onstage—vulnerable and triumphant, playful and sad—but the intimacy of her songcraft is front and center. “Her work as a songwriter is what speaks most clearly to me,” says filmmaker Greta Gerwig, whose feminist Barbie was its own testament to the idea that women can be anything. “To write music that is from the deepest part of herself and have it directly speak into the souls of other people.” As Swift whips through the eras, she’s not trying to update her old songs, whether the earnest romance of “You Belong With Me” or the millennial ennui of “22,” so much as she is embracing them anew. She’s modeling radical self-acceptance on the world’s largest stage, giving the audience a space to revisit their own joy or pain, once dismissed or forgotten. I tell Swift that the show made me think of a meme that says, “Do not kill the part of you that is cringe—kill the part of you that cringes.” “Yes!” she exclaims. “Every part of you that you’ve ever been, every phase you’ve ever gone through, was you working it out in that moment with the information you had available to you at the time. There’s a lot that I look back at like, ‘Wow, a couple years ago I might have cringed at this.’ You should celebrate who you are now, where you’re going, and where you’ve been.”\n\nGetting to this place of harmony with her past took work; there’s a dramatic irony, she explains, to the success of the tour. “It’s not lost on me that the two great catalysts for this happening were two horrendous things that happened to me,” Swift says, and this is where the story takes a turn. “The first was getting canceled within an inch of my life and sanity,” she says plainly. “The second was having my life’s work taken away from me by someone who hates me.”\n\nSwift shows me some things she loves in her apartment: a Stevie Nicks Barbie that sits still boxed in her kitchen, sent to her by the artist; the framed note from Paul McCartney that hangs in her bathroom; tiles around the fireplace that Swift found shopping in Paris with her mother. Connections to her family are everywhere, including a striking photo of her grandmother Marjorie, an opera singer and the inspiration for a track on her album evermore. Swift grew up on a Christmas-tree farm in Pennsylvania, with her younger brother Austin; her father Scott was a stockbroker at Merrill Lynch, and Andrea worked in marketing. Her family still works closely with her today. “My dad, my mom, and my brother come up with some of the best ideas in my career,” Swift says. “I always joke that we’re a small family business.”\n\nAustin, Andrea, and Scott Swift with Taylor at NYU graduation in 2022 where she received an honorary Doctorate of Fine ArtsCourtesy TAS Rights Management\nAfter moving to Nashville as a teen, she signed with Scott Borchetta’s Big Machine Records. Swift’s songwriting ability was evident from the first lyrics of “Tim McGraw,” her debut single: “He said the way my blue eyes shined put those Georgia stars to shame that night—I said, ‘That’s a lie.’” Even for country music these lyrics are literary—conjuring a romantic fantasy, then deflating it a line later. The fairy-tale promise of love and intimacy became a runner in Swift’s work as a songwriter, something she’d repeatedly espouse, then skewer; she was self-aware about the role narrative played in her expectations. She was seen as a gifted pop-country ingenue when, in a now infamous moment, Kanye West interrupted Swift onstage at the 2009 VMAs while she was accepting an award. The incident set in motion a chain of events that would shape the next decade of both artists’ lives. \n\nIt was around that time, Swift remembers now, that she began trying to shape-shift. “I realized every record label was actively working to try to replace me,” she says. “I thought instead, I’d replace myself first with a new me. It’s harder to hit a moving target.” Swift wrote songs solo, incorporated diverse sonic influences, and placed more clues about personal relationships in her lyrics and album materials for fans to decode. Her epic ballad “All Too Well,” from 2012’s Red, epitomizes Swift’s superpower as a songwriter, deploying tossed-off details like a forgotten scarf that comes back at the song’s end to stab you in the heart—but it also had a secret message hidden in the liner notes. When an extended version of the song hit No. 1 last year upon its rerelease, it wasn’t only because the song is extraordinary, but because it has its own lore, like Carly Simon’s “You’re So Vain” if it came with an experiential puzzle for fans to solve. “She’s like a whole room of writers as one person, with that voice and charisma,” Bridgers says. “She’s everything at once.”\n\nSwift knew she had to keep innovating. “By the time an artist is mature enough to psychologically deal with the job, they throw you out at 29, typically,” she says. “In the ’90s and ’00s, it seems like the music industry just said: ‘OK, let’s take a bunch of teenagers, throw them into a fire, and watch what happens. By the time they’ve accumulated enough wisdom to do their job effectively, we’ll find new teenagers.’” She went full-throttle pop for 2014’s 1989, putting her on top of the world—“an imperial phase,” she calls it. She didn’t realize it would also give her much farther to fall. Public sentiment turned—sniping about everything from her perceived overexposure to conspiracy theories about her politics. “I had all the hyenas climb on and take their shots,” she says. West wrote a song with vulgar lyrics about her, and claimed that Swift had consented to it, which Swift denied; West’s then wife, Kim Kardashian, released a video of a conversation between West and Swift that seemed to indicate that Swift had been on board with the song. The scandal was tabloid catnip; it made Swift look like a snake, which is what people called her. She felt it was “a career death,” she says. “Make no mistake—my career was taken away from me.”\n\nIt was a bleak moment. “You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar,” she says. “That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.” (Kardashian wrote, in a 2020 social media post, that the situation “forced me to defend him.”) Swift’s next album, 2017’s Reputation, featured snake imagery; the video for “Look What You Made Me Do” saw her killing off younger versions of herself. She remembers Reputation being met with uproar and skepticism. “I thought that moment of backlash was going to define me negatively for the rest of my life,” she says. She had also satisfied her record deal with Borchetta, and knew she wanted out. “The molecular chemistry of that old label was that every creative choice I wanted to make was second-guessed,” she says. “I was really overthinking these albums.”\n\nShe met with Lucian Grainge, the CEO of Universal Music Group, and Monte Lipman, who runs Universal’s top label Republic Records, to talk about signing a deal that would give her more agency. Today, Grainge is perhaps the most powerful executive in the music industry, but, as I sit with him in his office in Los Angeles, he describes himself as an “old punk” who operates on instinct more than metrics. He told Swift, he says, “We will utilize everything that we’ve got as a company for you.” Swift felt like she’d been given carte blanche: “Lucian and Monte basically said to me, ‘Whatever you turn in, we will be proud to put out. We give you 100% creative freedom and trust.’” It was exactly what she needed to hear most when the chips were down.\n\nYet the release of Swift’s first album with Republic, 2019’s Lover, coincided with the second big upheaval in her professional life: Borchetta had sold Big Machine—and with it, Swift’s catalog, valued then at a reported $140 million—to Ithaca Holdings, which is owned by music manager Scooter Braun, a former ally of West’s. “With the Scooter thing, my masters were being sold to someone who actively wanted them for nefarious reasons, in my opinion,” Swift says. (“It makes me sad that Taylor had that reaction to the deal,” Braun told Variety in 2021.) The sale meant that the rights to Swift’s first six albums moved to Braun, so whenever someone wanted to license one of those songs, he would be the one to profit. Swift rallied her fans against the deal, but still felt powerless. “I was so knocked on my ass by the sale of my music, and to whom it was sold,” she says. “I was like, ‘Oh, they got me beat now. This is it. I don’t know what to do.’” She went back to work, using the pandemic lockdown to pare back her sound on critically acclaimed albums folklore and evermore.\n\nAround the same time, she started thinking about rerecording her old albums in an effort to wrest back control. “I’d run into Kelly Clarkson and she would go, ‘Just redo it,’” Swift says. “My dad kept saying it to me too. I’d look at them and go, ‘How can I possibly do that?’ Nobody wants to redo their homework if on the way to school, the wind blows your book report away.” Since Swift wrote her own songs, she retained the musical composition copyright and could rerecord them. She also negotiated to own the master rights for her material when she moved over to Republic in 2018, so she now owns her new material and the rerecorded songs. (Major labels have since made it more difficult for artists to rerecord their music.) She began rerecording subtly different versions of her old albums, tagging them “(Taylor’s Version)” and adding unreleased tracks to redirect listenership to them. She frames the strategy as a coping mechanism. “It’s all in how you deal with loss,” she says. “I respond to extreme pain with defiance.”\n\nGrainge calls the rerecording project “bizarrely brilliant and unique”—something that only an artist at her level could pull off. “It’s got such a narrative—there’s a reason for it.” He shakes his head. “Imagine Picasso painting something that he painted a few years ago, then re-creating it with the colors of today.” Part of the success story, Swift says, is the freedom she received from the label to follow her instincts. “If you look at what I’ve put out since then, it’s more albums in the last few years than I did in the first 15 years of my career,” she says. That prolific output has fueled her ascension. “She could serve two terms as President of the United States and then go to Las Vegas,” Grainge says. “Who else can do that?” \n\nIn the grand narrative of Swift’s life, as she rose this year, her foes’ fortunes also seemed to turn. Over the summer, it was reported that several of Braun’s key clients—chief among them Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande—were no longer being managed by his company, while West’s antisemitic and other offensive remarks led to his losing key endorsement deals. Swift knows firsthand that fame is a seesaw. “Nothing is permanent,” she says. “So I’m very careful to be grateful every second that I get to be doing this at this level, because I’ve had it taken away from me before. There is one thing I’ve learned: My response to anything that happens, good or bad, is to keep making things. Keep making art.” She considers. “But I’ve also learned there’s no point in actively trying to quote unquote defeat your enemies,” she says. “Trash takes itself out every single time.”\n\nThe premiere for Swift’s concert film takes place at the Grove, an outdoor mall in Los Angeles, which has been shut down for the event; Swift has packed 13 screens with thousands of fans. She goes, one by one, to each theater thanking sobbing audience members for being there. Like the tour, the film, which was released directly to theaters without a traditional partner, is an event. “We met with all the studios,” she tells me, “and we met with all the streamers, and we sized up how it was perceived and valued, and if they had high hopes and dreams for it. Ultimately I did what I tend to do more and more often these days, which is to bet on myself.” She credits her father with the idea. “He just said, why does there have to be a—for lack of a better word—middleman?”\n\nIn the theater excitement ripples through the crowd, a mix of fans and Swift’s friends, as we wait for her. To my left are two dedicated Swifties, sisters who introduce themselves as Madison, 23, and McCall, 20, and who are still reeling from taking a selfie with Swift on the red carpet. Their wrists are covered in friendship bracelets, some of which are deep cuts—such as no it’s BECKY, a reference to a beloved Tumblr meme, and BLEACHELLA STAN, for Swift’s 2016 platinum blond bob—and Madison reveals a tattoo on her forearm that says “Taylor’s Version.” Both tell me their favorite album is Reputation. They are my favorite people I have ever met, and I want to talk to only them for the rest of my life. Madison admires Swift for her vulnerability—“which is insane, when she’s under endless scrutiny”—while McCall cites her consistency, which she calls “a lost art form.” When I ask how McCall feels about Swift’s romantic life, she fields the question elegantly. “It’s a disservice to her to focus on that stuff,” she says. “She’s so good at making her personal experience relate to millions of people. When I listen to her songs, I think about what I’ve been through—not what she’s been through.”\n\nSwift’s private life has long served as both grist for the tabloid mill and inspiration for her own work; she split from her longtime boyfriend, actor Joe Alwyn, earlier this year. Most recently, she’s been dating the NFL star Travis Kelce, as has been well documented when she attends his games. “I don’t know how they know what suite I’m in,” she says. “There’s a camera, like, a half-mile away, and you don’t know where it is, and you have no idea when the camera is putting you in the broadcast, so I don’t know if I’m being shown 17 times or once.” She is sensitive to the attention that’s put on her when she shows up. “I’m just there to support Travis,” she says. “I have no awareness of if I’m being shown too much and pissing off a few dads, Brads, and Chads.”\n\nAfter playing Kansas City in July, Swift returned in October to support her boyfriend, Chiefs star Travis KelceDavid Eulitt—Getty Images\nI point out that it’s a net positive for the NFL to have a few Swifties watching. “Football is awesome, it turns out,” Swift says playfully. “I’ve been missing out my whole life.” (A game she attended in October was the most-watched Sunday show since the Super Bowl.)\n\nGiven her complex history with public interest in her dating life, I say, it seems noteworthy that her relationship with Kelce has played out so publicly. Swift gently pushes back: “This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,” she says. “We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other. By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.” The larger point, for her, is that there’s nothing to hide. “When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care,” she says. “The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other.”\n\nSwift’s openness is one part of why her fan base leans heavily, though not exclusively, female. The Eras Tour was one critical piece of what Swift calls “a three-part summer of feminine extravaganza”—the other two parts being Gerwig’s box-office bonanza Barbie and Beyoncé’s blockbuster, culture-shifting Renaissance Tour. “To make a fun, entertaining blast of a movie, with that commentary,” she says of Barbie, “I cannot imagine how hard that was, and Greta made it look so easy.” (“I’m just a sucker for a gal who is good with words, and she is the best with them,” Gerwig says about Swift, whom she calls “Bruce Springsteen meets Loretta Lynn meets Bob Dylan.”)\n\nSwift is no less effusive in talking about Beyoncé, who brokered a similar deal with AMC and shows up to Swift’s Los Angeles premiere; the next month, Swift returns the favor by attending Beyoncé’s in London. “She’s the most precious gem of a person—warm and open and funny,” Swift says. “And she’s such a great disrupter of music-industry norms. She taught every artist how to flip the table and challenge archaic business practices.” That her tour and Beyoncé’s were frequently juxtaposed is vexing. “There were so many stadium tours this summer, but the only ones that were compared were me and Beyoncé,” she says. “Clearly it’s very lucrative for the media and stan culture to pit two women against each other, even when those two artists in question refuse to participate in that discussion.”\n\nTo Swift, the success of all three feels like an inflection point. “If we have to speak stereotypically about the feminine and the masculine,” she says, “women have been fed the message that what we naturally gravitate toward—” She has a few examples: “Girlhood, feelings, love, breakups, analyzing those feelings, talking about them nonstop, glitter, sequins! We’ve been taught that those things are more frivolous than the things that stereotypically gendered men gravitate toward, right?” Right, I say. “And what has existed since the dawn of time? A patriarchal society. What fuels a patriarchal society? Money, flow of revenue, the economy. So actually, if we’re going to look at this in the most cynical way possible, feminine ideas becoming lucrative means that more female art will get made. It’s extremely heartening.”\n\nAmid so much attention, it seems noteworthy that Swift appears more relaxed in the public eye, not less—although I wonder out loud whether it just appears that way. She nods. “Over the years, I’ve learned I don’t have the time or bandwidth to get pressed about things that don’t matter. Yes, if I go out to dinner, there’s going to be a whole chaotic situation outside the restaurant. But I still want to go to dinner with my friends.” She sounds thoughtful. “Life is short. Have adventures. Me locking myself away in my house for a lot of years—I’ll never get that time back. I’m more trusting now than I was six years ago.” \n\nShe’s also having more fun. At her premiere, Swift sits in the same row as me, Madison, and McCall, singing along and dancing in her seat; we keep craning our necks to look at her, sharing thunderstruck looks: Isn’t this surreal? There are moments in the film when the cameras capture the enormous screens behind Swift onstage, and it feels like a house of mirrors, these myriad reflections of Taylor Swift—us watching her watch herself on a screen, which is itself showing Swift’s image on so many screens, the thousands of fans onscreen in the stadium and us in this theater, with Swift in the middle of it—all of us rapt, unable to look away.\n\nSwift and I have been talking for a while now at her apartment, long enough that our coffees have gone cold and her cat Benjamin Button has trundled into the room, then gotten bored and left. She tells me about revisiting Reputation, which is perhaps the most charged era in the tour. “It’s a goth-punk moment of female rage at being gaslit by an entire social structure,” she says, laughing. “I think a lot of people see it and they’re just like, Sick snakes and strobe lights.” The upcoming vault tracks for Reputation will be “fire,” she promises. The rerecordings project feels like a mythical quest to her. “I’m collecting horcruxes,” she says. “I’m collecting infinity stones. Gandalf’s voice is in my head every time I put out a new one. For me, it is a movie now.”\n\n\nInez and Vinoodh for TIME\nIt strikes me then that for all the talk about eras, it’s also worth thinking about genres—how Swift has moved between them in the stories she’s told. At first, it was a coming-of-age story, one about a young woman finding her way in the world and honing her voice before a fickle public. Then there were romances, great ones—tales of enchantment and desire, heartbreak and disillusionment, relationships that she both excavated for her songs and that the media documented for her with either joy or schadenfreude, depending on the day. There have been dramas with stakes so high and turns so twisty they feel Shakespearean in their scope, betrayals both personal and professional that have shaped her life. Occasionally, these stories have tipped into screwball comedy—like when a crowd in Seattle cheered so loudly it registered as an earthquake, or when, on a tour stop in Brazil, the local archdiocese allowed messages celebrating her to be projected onto the 124-ft. Christ the Redeemer statue. But they have one thing in common: Swift. \n\nShe is a maestro of self-determination, of writing her own story. The multihyphenate television creator Shonda Rhimes—no stranger to a plot twist—who has known Swift since she was a teenager, puts it simply: “She controls narrative not only in her work, but in her life,” she says. “It used to feel like people were taking shots at her. Now it feels like she’s providing the narrative—so there aren’t any shots to be taken.”\n\nHere, Swift has told me a story about redemption, about rising and falling only to rise again—a hero’s journey. I do not say to her, in our conversation, that it did not always look that way from the outside—that, for example, when Reputation’s lead single “Look What You Made Me Do” reached No. 1 on the charts, or when the album sold 1.3 million albums in the first week, second only to 1989, she did not look like someone whose career had died. She looked like a superstar who was mining her personal experience as successfully as ever. I am tempted to say this.\n\nBut then I think, Who am I to challenge it, if that’s how she felt? The point is: she felt canceled. She felt as if her career had been taken from her. Something in her had been lost, and she was grieving it. Maybe this is the real Taylor Swift effect: That she gives people, many of them women, particularly girls, who have been conditioned to accept dismissal, gaslighting, and mistreatment from a society that treats their emotions as inconsequential, permission to believe that their interior lives matter. That for your heart to break, whether it’s from being kicked off a tour or by the memory of a scarf still sitting in a drawer somewhere or because somebody else controls your life’s work, is a valid wound, and no, you’re not crazy for being upset about it, or for wanting your story to be told. \n\nAfter all, not to be corny, haven’t we all become selective autobiographers in the digital age as we curate our lives for our own audiences of any size—cutting away from the raw fabric of our lived experience to reveal the shape of the story we most want to tell, whether it’s on our own feeds or the world’s stage? I can’t blame her for being better at it than everyone else. It’s also not like she hasn’t admitted it. She sang it herself, in her song “Mastermind,” off last year’s Midnights, in a bridge so feathery you could almost miss that it marks some of the rawest, most naked songwriting of her career: “No one wanted to play with me as a little kid/ So I’ve been scheming like a criminal ever since/ To make them love me and make it seem effortless/ This is the first time I’ve felt the need to confess/ And I swear I’m only cryptic and Machiavellian because I care.”\n\n\nInez and Vinoodh for TIME\nShe tells me she wrote that song after watching the Paul Thomas Anderson film Phantom Thread, which—spoiler—culminates in the reveal of a vast, layered manipulation. “Remember that last scene?” she says. “I thought, wouldn’t it be fun to have a lyric about being calculated?” She pauses. “It’s something that’s been thrown at me like a dagger, but now I take it as a compliment.” \n\nIt is a compliment. After I leave Swift’s house, I can’t stop thinking about how perfectly she crafted this story for me—the one about redemption, how she lost it all and got it back. Storytelling is what she’s always done; that’s why, Chesney tells me, he gave her that gift all those years ago. “She was a writer who had something to say,” he says. “That isn’t something you can fake by writing clichés. You can only live it, then write it as real as possible.” \n\nShe must have known that all the references she made had hidden meanings, that I’d see all the tossed-off details for the Easter eggs they were. The way she told me that story about Chesney, she knew there was a lesson, about the power of generosity, and how a crushing defeat can give way to a great and surprising gift. The way she said, “Are you not entertained?”—surely we both knew it was a quote from Gladiator, a movie in which a hero falls from grace, is forced to perform blood sport for the pleasure of spectators, and emerges victorious, having survived humiliation and debasement to soar higher than ever. And the way before I left, she showed me the note from Paul McCartney hanging in her bathroom, which has a Beatles lyric written on it—and not just any Beatles lyric, but this one: “Take these broken wings and learn to fly.” —With reporting by Leslie Dickstein and Megan McCluskey •\n\nStyled by Heidi Bivens at Honey Artists; hair by Holli Smith; make-up by Diane Kendal; nails by Maki Sakamoto; production by VLM Productions\n\nOn the covers: \n\nJacket, denim shirt and turtleneck by Polo Ralph Lauren; dress by Area; bodysuit by Bardot, tights by Wolford; earrings are artist’s own\n\nOn the inside: \n\nJacket, denim shirt and turtleneck by Polo Ralph Lauren; tuxedo jacket, tuxedo shirt, vest and pocket square by Ralph Lauren Collection, jeans by Polo Ralph Lauren; dress by Alaia; rings by Anna Sheffield and Cartier; earrings are artist’s own\nBY SAM LANSKY | PHOTOGRAPHS BY INEZ AND VINOODH FOR TIME\nDECEMBER 6, 2023 7:38 AM EST",

      "Transcript/Content": "The Inspiration Behind Inez and Vinoodh’s Taylor Swift TIME Person of the Year Covers\n\nBy Cady Lang\nDecember 6, 2023 7:55 AM EST\n\nInez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, better known professionally by their first names only, are responsible for some of the most striking celebrity portraits of their generation, from Lady Gaga to Barack Obama. The pair, who are partners in both work and life, met as students at fashion school in their hometown of Amsterdam and made names for themselves as the go-to photographers for cutting-edge fashion editorials and big-name luxury brands.\n\nAs early adopters of digital photography, they became known for their experimental style, sharp images, and fine-art sensibility—all elements that helped produce their distinctive portraits. Inez and Vinoodh have a way of making every subject look and feel confident. Their often-high profile subjects are rendered even more powerful, more glamorous, and more dynamic than they may already feel, making the couple apt documenters to the world of celebrity.\n\nSo perhaps it’s only fitting that the duo would take on a subject as culturally dominant as Taylor Swift. During her cover shoot in New York City for TIME’s Person of the Year story, Inez and Vinoodh captured the pop star in her prime, in the midst of her Eras tour. While the pair had photographed her once before, for a 2019 Vogue shoot, they were excited to collaborate with her again, calling her the “ideal subject.”\n\nMore From TIME\nAhead of the launch of TIME’s 2023 Person of the Year story, Inez spoke to TIME about their inspiration for the shoot, what’s changed since they last photographed Taylor, and their favorite Swift era.\n\nTIME: How did you prepare for your shoot with Taylor?\n\nInez van Lamsweerde: First of all, we went to see The Eras Tour movie—it's just incredible. And then we did a deep dive into all her different personifications and the way she expressed her feelings over the years of her career to form a concept. We were mostly struck by watching her perform her lyrics, the way she relates to you and how that releases an extraordinary sense of empathy in her. The way she talks, the way she looks at life, it's with this heightened sense of empathy that's quite extraordinary. Combined with this incredibly glamorous side that’s sort of like old Hollywood and her amazing strength, defiance and power, we tried to express each of them throughout all the different sessions that we did. \n\nTaylor’s currently in the midst of her Eras Tour. Obviously, she was in a different era the last time you shot her in 2019. How do you think she has changed? How do you perceive her in her current era?\n\nI think it's mostly growing up. I could see the extreme fulfillment she has from performing. She loves performing. She loves the connection that she has with people. That's what's extraordinary about her openness and respectfulness. She's just a very generous, gentle person; she'll have an opinion and she'll express it in the most respectful way and is extremely collaborative. It's extraordinary how someone of that level of fame can actually stay that connected and in touch with life and our own feelings. She doesn't seem at all like she's removed from reality—she's very much in it.\n\nWhat do you think makes Taylor an interesting subject to shoot?\n\nApart from her beauty, obviously, there's this idea that she's your best friend. What's so wonderful about her is she's open and real and she'll talk about anything, like she does in her lyrics—she loves connecting. It's about what she expresses that people can actually relate to, feel comforted by or inspired by, or [be] given strength by and it's quite extraordinary the way she manages to do that. She basically provided the soundtrack to so many young people's lives; people have grown up with her.\n\nRead More: Taylor Swift Makes History as Person of the Year. Here’s How\n\nDo you have a favorite era of Taylor’s?\n\nThat's hard for me because I like all of it. I think Reputation is probably my favorite, just for the defiance of it. \n\nCan we talk about the photo of Taylor with her cat?\n\nBenjamin! [Swift has a ragdoll cat named Benjamin Button.]\n\nHow did this photo come about?\n\nThere's a book by photographer Bill Hayward called Cat People from the ‘70s, with journalistic photos of cat lovers and their cats, but it's all entertainers, writers, journalists—some very famous, some not so famous. And the pictures are brilliant. It shows very well the relationship that people have with their cats. But at the same time, [shows] the way cats are kind of on their own—they're a special breed of animal. So I got a vintage copy of it for Taylor because I know she's a major cat lover, and her cats travel with her. And I said, “You know, I've always wanted to do a picture like the one that's on the cover of that book where the cat's on the shoulder of the girl.” It speaks to a sense of carrying everything on your shoulders but being defiant while doing so. And she agreed and that's how that picture happened.\n\n\nTIME\nRead More: Behind the Scenes of TIME’s 2023 Person of the Year Issue\n\nWhy do you think that the photo would embody Taylor in this particular moment?\n\nIt really has everything: Her glamor, her power, her sense of empathy of carrying the whole world on her shoulders. Because if you do feel like that—she's so involved in everything, whether it's getting young people to vote, etc.—she's always pushing for things that are outside of the music realm. I felt that there is something there in her body position that's very powerful and strong. Her expression and the way she looks has this old Hollywood glamor but underneath, there’s so much power in her stance. The way she has Benjamin on her shoulders is kind of like, ‘Yeah, I'm carrying you all.’ ",

      "Transcript/Content": "Behind the Scenes of TIME’s 2023 Person of the Year Issue\n\nBy Sam JacobsDecember 6, 2023 7:47 AM EST\n\nJacobs is Editor in Chief at TIME, where he leads TIME’s global newsroom and its journalism across all platforms. Since joining TIME in 2013, Jacobs has held a variety of senior editorial leadership positions. Previously, he was national political correspondent at Reuters, associate editor at Newsweek, and staff reporter for The Daily Beast. His writing has appeared in the Boston Globe and New York Observer.\nThis past September, our editors and reporters gathered to debate who should be TIME’s Person of the Year. The annual staff conversation is both entertaining and contentious, as we argue about which one person or group of people, of the nearly 8 billion alive today, had the most influence, for good or ill, on the year. From that first conversation, teams of reporters set out to cover the most promising candidates. The result is the issue you hold in your hands, and the words, photographs, and videos that appear on your screens. \n\nSam Lansky, the writer of this year’s Person of the Year profile of Taylor Swift, has known the singer for over a decade through his work as an editor. Earlier this fall he visited with Swift at home for her first in-depth conversation with a journalist in nearly four years. With her three Person of the Year covers, photographed by Inez and Vinoodh, Swift makes her fourth, fifth, and sixth appearances on our cover. It’s been 14 years since Swift’s first interview with TIME, when the 19-year-old took questions from her tour bus on Hollywood Boulevard, brushing off concerns about trading a college experience for touring as a musician. “No matter what path you choose,” she said, “you’re going to miss something, and I don’t want to miss this.”\n\nRead More: The Inspiration Behind Inez and Vinoodh’s Taylor Swift TIME Person of the Year Covers\n\nFor the 2023 CEO of the Year story, Naina Bajekal and Billy Perrigo visited San Francisco to meet with Sam Altman; he spoke with TIME three times in November, both before and after Altman was removed from and returned to his position leading the world’s most influential AI company. Their profile, accompanied by portraits created by photographer Joe Pugliese, offers a detailed accounting of those tumultuous days.\n\nSean Gregory has written or co-written all of TIME’s Athlete of the Year profiles since we first created the recognition in 2019. For this year’s edition, Sean interviewed and profiled Lionel Messi, one of the most successful soccer players of all time. The accompanying cover image was created by illustrator (and soccer fan) Neil Jamieson.\n\nMore From TIME\nRead More: Behind the Scenes of TIME’s 2023 Person of the Year Issue\n\nAlso for this issue, Karl Vick traveled to Israel following the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre. Karl—who was previously TIME’s bureau chief in Israel—and London-based staff writer Yasmeen Serhan set out to find individuals who have made a difference supporting fellow citizens since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas War. Magnum photographer Moises Saman took portraits to accompany their stories.\n\nPhotography for the issue was overseen by Katherine Pomerantz, Dilys Ng, Sangsuk Sylvia Kang, and Kara Milstein; video by Justine Simons and Alex Robson; art direction by Chelsea Kardokus, Chrissy Dunleavy, and D.W. Pine, who has now created 14 years of Person of the Year covers. Digital-audience strategy was led by Samantha Cooney, with support by Meg Zukin. Liz Murray coordinated digital production. And, working alongside Lori Fradkin, Kelly Conniff—who is marking her 11th year at TIME—oversaw the entire project. “This issue demonstrates how many shapes influence can take,” Kelly said. “To be able to include news-making interviews with Altman, Messi, and Swift, three of the most captivating people in the world, each for radically different reasons, makes this year’s Person of the Year particularly special.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Even though they’ve recorded three albums together, Jack Antonoff doesn’t ever remember officially booking a studio session with Lana Del Rey. “We’ll just text and be like, ‘Where are you?’ ‘Okay, come over,’” he says. “I was with her the other day and we just went to the studio and started messing around. It’s very loose.” That casualness sets the tone for the whole recording process, no matter what kind of song they’re working on. “The music can be so incredibly serious, and we just end up trolling each other and being funny the whole time.”  \n>Antonoff is feeling reflective as he whirls around his New York apartment, making coffee and getting ready to go out with his sister, Rachel Antonoff, and wife, Margaret Qualley. When he thinks back on the past year and change, he’s grateful to have close collaborators like Del Rey, along with his friend Taylor Swift, and his band Bleachers. Those bonds paid off when Antonoff was nominated for six Grammys earlier this year — including what could be his third Producer of the Year in a row — largely thanks to [his production work](https://www.vulture.com/2020/07/jack-antonoff-producer-guide.html) on Swift’s [*Midnights*](https://www.vulture.com/2022/10/midnights-album-review-taylor-swift.html) and Del Rey’s [*Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd*](https://www.vulture.com/2023/03/lana-del-rey-ocean-blvd-review.html)*.* “A lot of creative industries, especially nowadays, are so obsessed with these harsh pivots, so it’s not common to have really long-term collaborators,” he says over video call. He’s also produced multiple albums for Lorde and St. Vincent and recently added the 1975 to his cadre. While some fans accuse him of adding too much of his ’80s pop style or dulling their favorite musicians’ best qualities, the artists themselves keep coming back — none more than Swift, whom he’s worked with since her 2014 album, *1989*. “We will continue working together till 2089,” she said, joking, as she accepted an award at this year’s VMAs.  \n>  \n>Safe to say Antonoff feels the same way about Bleachers, the group he started in 2014 as his own E Street Band. He’d spent the bulk of his performing career jumping between bands, from his grade-school punk band Outline to the jaunty rock outfit Steel Train to the indie-pop supergroup fun. Now, as he’s preparing to release Bleachers’ self-titled fourth album next March, he’s writing in new styles and breaking down the barriers between the band and his solo production. But throughout our conversation, he can’t stop coming back to Del Rey’s “A&W,” which was nominated for Song of the Year this year. “We didn’t say this in the room, but it’s the kind of song where you would be like, *Well, it’s definitely not getting nominated for a Grammy!*” he says of the seven-minute, two-part opus. “But, you know what, Lana and Taylor and this year I’ve had, I think the through-line is keep finding things that fucking thrill you. To do anything but push and find new ground is a bastardization of the job.”\n\n**Song you and Taylor Swift couldn’t have made until** ***Midnights***\n\n>Maybe “Mastermind.” We made the bulk of that album in my apartment. There’s a little studio in there, which is the same place that we’ve worked for many years. It feels like we have such a bedrock beneath us of things that we know that we can do that it makes it really feel possible to stretch. And I remember when we were making “Mastermind,” we were laughing at each other about going this way and that way. It’s a strange little song,Swift, for her part, recently said the song was inspired by the end of *Phantom Thread*: “I thought, wouldn’t it be fun to have a lyric about being calculated?” and it just reminded me of the kind of thing that you can do with really close friends, whereas if it was a new relationship, you might not be able to dare to suck. Like, just try some weird shit. Because every once in a while, when you really throw yourself out there, you actually get the stuff that’s the most brilliant.\n\n**Most surprising Swift era**\n\n>Oh, every one. I’ve never been in a room with her and felt like we were doing anything but treading new ground that we’ve let last for even ten seconds. If we’re not feeling it, we’ll move right the hell along. What I think is fascinating about songwriting is you can’t fake it. There’s no shortcut; it comes or it doesn’t. But the one thing that the years can do for you is at least recognize when it’s not happening and get off quicker. When I was 19, I might go down a rabbit hole of some weird shit because I would care about the amount of time or the resources I put into it, and the more I do it, the more I realize that that’s a fool’s errand. You show up, you hope to grab it, and you do or you don’t. When I’m with my collaborators, the further we go down the road, the more we’re only vibrating on the really special stuff.  \n>  \n>We’ve been at this point for many years. I mean, we started working together on *’89*, we did a ton of work on *Reputation*, which was so wonderful and intense, and then *Lover*, we started to do some more strange things. When we did *Folklore*, that was obviously a really different angle, and some of the earlier songs, like “August” and “Mirrorball,” are some of my favorite things we’ve ever done. You know, writing a song and collaborating with somebody, once you do it, you’re like, *Well, who knows if that’ll ever happen again*, ’cause it’s just magic. With her, I’m constantly taken aback. I’ll joke with her sometimes when we get something crazy, like, “Okay, I guess we still fucking got it!” There’s really nothing for her and I left to do if we’re not completely stretching ourselves out there into the darkness. And that was the whole story with *Midnights* — we did so many things that we had never done before.\n\n**Hardest part of re-recording his own songs for** ***1989 (Taylor’s Version)***\n\n>I don’t work with any soft synths, so everything is a sound that’s made in the room. The funny thing is you can’t recall the sounds. So all the Bleachers guys helped a ton on that stuff.Specifically “Out of the Woods,” “I Wish You Would,” and “You Are in Love,” the three tracks Antonoff originally produced on *1989*. It became a really fun project for me and the band. It was like, “All right, Mikey,Mikey Freedom Hart, who plays keys and guitars in Bleachers. here are the Juno tracks, do your best.” “Sean,Sean Hutchinson, who drums in Bleachers. here’s the drum stuff, see what you can do.” And then I’ll have X amount of tracks that are just sound from the room. The internet was really interested in what sounded like a seagull sound in “Is It Over Now?” It was really fun, because it was all these analog instruments that we know and love: Moog model Ds, Juno-6s.  \n>  \n>I would liken it to finding an old diary. There are so many things on so many of those sessions that I was like, *Oh, you little freak.* Little layering I would do then, ’cause you go through phases, and it made me feel really sweet. That younger version of me that was just piling shit on, I mean, “Out of the Woods” is just like kitchen sink. That’s the glory of it: As someone who didn’t really have any success as a producer, there was no reason for me to pile all that shit on other than it was just giving me a lot of joy. And it made this weird, messy symphony and I love it to this day.\n\n**Blurb about gut-punch lyrics:**\n\n>But yeah, the stuff that shocks me the most is someone’s vulnerability in a song. The end of “You’re on Your Own, Kid” is one of those moments for me. I remember, she wrote that (In the bridge, Swift reflects on the arc of her music career: “‘Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned / Everything you lose is a step you take.”) right in front of me and then we put it down, and I was completely punched in the gut. Beautiful.\n\n**Hardest projects produced**\n\n>The end of “August,” the strings and twangy guitar — that was one where it was really in my head, production-wise, for a long time. The end has to be so euphoric. She’s talking about, like, “Meet me behind the mall” and “Back when we were living for the hope of it all.” I kept attaching to all of her lyrics and being like, *This crescendo at the end has to feel like all of that, on fire*.",

Do you ever get disappointed when a favorite of yours doesn’t make the cut?\n\nNo, because I think that we’re always looking at the same thing, so it’s not possible that I could think, “This is my favorite! It’s gotta make the album,” because it doesn’t really work like that. You’re on the same team thinking about something much bigger than what might be your favorite song. A perfect example of that is on the Lana album, the song “A&W.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "On Dec. 13, the state House of Representatives voted (by a slim margin) to approve House Resolution 282, recognizing 2023 as the “Taylor Swift Era” in Pennsylvania. The measure celebrated her recent selection by TIME Magazine and acknowledged “her positive impact on Pennsylvania’s economy, voter registration numbers, consumer protections and pro-labor practices.”\n\nAccording to the resolution, Swift “through talent, hard work and determination … has transcended the role of pop star, becoming a veritable cultural and economic force” and “shines as a role model of courage, self-acceptance and self-determination, persisting in the face of personal and professional obstacles and challenges.” It also notes that her most recent concert tour “spurred an economic boom for every city she visited, with positive impacts felt in the hospitality, travel, tourism, retail and even housing sectors.”\n\nLawmakers approved the resolution on Swift’s 34th birthday.\n\nAlthough Lebanon County state Rep. Russ Diamond (R-102nd) has a personal connection with Swift (more on that later) and even sang a snippet of her hit “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” on the House floor, he was among the largely Republican base who voted against the resolution.\n\nStill, Diamond seems to have a fond thought for the star.\n\n“Yes, I knew her when,” he posted on Facebook on Dec. 6. “She was a young budding singer/songwriter and I pressed a couple demo CDs for her when my business was down on Main Street. Pretty sure I have a copy or two laying around somewhere….”\n\nComments on his post ranged from “That’s super cool Russ!” to “Was she as annoying then as she is now?” (to which Diamond replied: “She was a sweet kid.”) to “No way!!! Hope you have some good stories to share!” to “I wouldn’t brag about that.” to “That’s a worthwhile credit on the resume, not as cool as some of the PA Musician bands but still cool.”\n\n‘A nice kid’ in Annville\n\nDiamond’s Annville-based production company, which started as a Lebanon area recording studio in 1992 and has evolved into Raintree Multimedia, also posted a notice about TIME’s designation on Dec. 6: “Congratulations to Taylor Swift on being named Time magazine’s Person of the Year! Taylor is one of 5 Grammy nominees we’ve worked with over the last 31 years. We knew her when!”\n\nHowever, Diamond told LebTown, he doesn’t recall listening to Swift’s music when his company pressed her demos.\n\n“In the business of duplicating CDs, actually listening to the music on those recordings is not common other than a cursory review to make sure the reproduced data is a digital match for the data provided by the client,” he wrote in an email to LebTown.\n\n“That said, I do recall listening to the first project we did for Taylor Swift at Raintree Productions, as it was sponsored by I-105, a popular country music station, and as radio support is a big deal for any artist,” he added. “Upon listening, it seemed that she was probably on the right track for success. That CD had 4 or 5 songs on it, if I recall correctly.\n\n“The second project we did for her was a 2-song demo that she (or perhaps her parents) underwrote herself. Pretty sure she was already trying to work the Nashville scene at that point, and it was not long after that she began to gain national acclaim.”\n\n\nAn early demo CD by Taylor Swift. (Source: Pat Garrett’s video “Just Taylor”)\nDiamond’s personal interactions with the future star were limited, however.\n\n“I believe she was at my office in Annville once or twice, and she struck me as a nice kid,” he recollected. “I’m guessing she was 12-14 years old. I mostly dealt with her mother, who was managing her career then.”\n\nTaylor’s other Lebanon connection\n\nWho knows where Taylor Swift’s career would have led her if her parents had not heeded the advice of a Lebanon County native back when she was a preteen wannabe singer?\n\nThat wise sage is none other than Pat Garrett, a country singer and guitarist of some renown who also runs an international sheepskin coat company, Sickafus Sheepskins, in Strausstown, Berks County.\n\n\nPat Garrett and Taylor Swift. (Screengrab from Pat Garrett’s video “Just Taylor.”)\nGarrett was born Patrick Henry Sickafus on April 16, 1942, at Lebanon’s own Good Samaritan Hospital. His parents raised him at their home west of Bethel, which lies just east of the Lebanon County line. And, while his formative years and subsequent careers were spent largely in Berks County, he also owns a couple of local radio stations — WTPA-92.1FM in Harrisburg and WWSM-1510AM, near Palmyra.\n\n(WWSM, by the way, ceased broadcasting after a lightning strike in July 2022 seriously damaged the transmitter at the station’s studios along Colebrook Road. The station now broadcasts exclusively through online streaming on its website.)\n\nAs lead singer for the Pat Garrett Band, Garrett has recorded country hits including “Bad Woman,” “Wild Hog,” “Sexy Ole Lady,” “Everlovin’ Woman” and “Moose Shootin’ Mama.” He opened the Pat Garrett Amphitheater in Strausstown in 1995 and, later, the Pat Garrett Roadhouse — both of which were venues for a young Taylor Swift.\n\nHe recalls working in the roadhouse one day when “a fellow came in and wanted to do karaoke in there. I like live music … but he said he’d do the first one for free.” The price was right, so Garrett gave it a try — and it caught on, especially after he got the notion to run a 16-week, all-ages karaoke contest with the grand prize being an opening set before a touring headliner at the amphitheater.\n\nThat’s a pretty big deal for a rising country star. Back in those days, Garrett’s amphitheater hosted the likes of Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Loretta Lynn, and Merle Haggard.\n\n\nA karaoke poster from the Pat Garrett Roadhouse, showing Taylor Swift’s entry in blue. (Photo provided by Pat Garrett)\nThe contest ramped up the roadhouse’s profile significantly, Garrett said. And one evening, 11-year-old Taylor came in with a large group of family and friends. Needless to say, she won the contest and earned a brief slot on stage before a Charlie Daniels concert, Garrett said. That led to gigs at places like the Bloomsburg Fair and Knoebels Park, and a recurring spot on stage with Garrett, his wife and vocalist/bassist Suzy Dalton, and the Pat Garrett Band.\n\n“She played a half-dozen shows with us,” Garrett told LebTown. “She did good.”\n\nShe ‘was acceptable’\n\nGarrett’s earliest impressions of Taylor were favorable, but he admitted in a telephone interview with LebTown that he wasn’t blown away.\n\n“She was always a show-biz gal,” he said. “When she first started singing, she wasn’t killer, but it was acceptable. She got better over the years. Now she’s queen of the world.”\n\nScreengrab from Pat Garrett’s video “Just Taylor,” showing him and a young Taylor Swift performing on stage together.\nScreengrab from Pat Garrett’s video “Just Taylor,” showing him and a young Taylor Swift performing on stage together.\nOver time, he said, Garrett “became very friendly with her parents. Her dad was very influential in her career. … If it wasn’t for her dad and mom, she might still be singing karaoke someplace. Maybe not.”\n\nTaylor “did very good, she worked very hard,” Garrett said. But asked if he ever imagined she’d go this far, he was succinct in his response.\n\n“No.”\n\nThat didn’t stop him from offering advice that would dramatically affect her career.\n\n“I remember her dad came in after I’d known them about a year. He said, ‘What am I going to do with this kid?’ I told him, ‘In Hershey they make bars, in Detroit they make cars, and in Nashville they make stars.’\n\n“He came back in a few months later and said, ‘Well, we’re going.’ I said, ‘Oh yeah, where?’ He said ‘Nashville.’ … I figured they’d go for a month or two. He said no, they’re going for the rest of their lives.”\n\nBack in those days, Garrett said, Scott Swift was his financial adviser and, even from Nashville, “he used to call me several times a week. He’d talk to me 5 minutes about finances and another 55 minutes about Taylor.”\n\nSome more good advice\n\nNot only did Garrett direct Taylor’s family to Nashville, he also pointed her toward a man who was instrumental in making her famous: Scott Borchetta, founder of Big Machine Records.\n\n“I told (Taylor’s father) who he was — the hottest promotion man in the business,” Garrett said. “He was putting a new label together, Big Machine.”\n\nGarrett, who had recorded with Polygram Records in Nashville, said he knew Borchetta’s father, Mike, who had worked in record promotions for record labels including Capitol, RCA, and Mercury before moving to Nashville to start his own independent record promotion company. He downplayed his involvement in getting Swift and Borchetta together, though. “I just mentioned his name. … I tried to help wherever I could.”\n\nThe biggest boost to Taylor’s career — talent aside, Garrett said — was her father’s financial wherewithal.\n\n“He put $5 million together to back her,” he explained. “That’s one thing a lot of people don’t have, that backing. … He was able to fly her around to visit radio stations, pay publicists — that’s something ordinary people don’t have.”\n\nIn any case, Borchetta started Big Machine in 2005 with just 13 employees and Taylor Swift as the label’s first signed artist.\n\nOver the next 12 years or so, Taylor recorded and released six albums through the label: “Taylor Swift” (2006), “Fearless” (2008), “Speak Now” (2010), “Red” (2012), “1989” (2014), and “Reputation” (2017).\n\nThen came the much-publicized hullabaloo with Scooter Braun. In the years since, Taylor has re-recorded four albums: “Fearless,” “Speak Now,” “Red,” and “1989,” each with “(Taylor’s Version)” added to the title and each debuting at No. 1 on Billboard.\n\nWill their paths cross again?\n\nWe asked Garrett is he ever still hears from Taylor or her parents. He hesitated before answering.\n\n“No,” he admitted. “She’s too busy to be calling me up.”\n\nStill, he said he feels some degree of paternal pride in her success, which he played some part in fostering.\n\n“Oh sure. I was glad to be able to help,” Garrett said.\n\nBut he wouldn’t mind a professional reunion, if his song “Just Taylor” is any indication.\n\nOn his YouTube channel, Garrett uploaded a video for the light-hearted song on Feb. 28, 2017. When they first met, he wrote in the video’s description, “She says, ‘Hi I’m Taylor.’ I said, ‘Hi, Taylor. What’s your last name?’ She says, ‘Just Taylor.’ I said ‘I’m just Pat.’ The title of this song was inspired by that first encounter.”\n\nThe video is full of photographs and video clips from both of their careers, including a few brief glimpses of a very young Taylor Swift performing with Garrett’s band.\n\n“This song is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek, but also heart-felt tribute to that little golden-haired cherub who totally believed in herself!” Garrett said in the description.\n\n\nTaylor Swift in concert. (Source: https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/media)\nAt one point in the lyrics, he sings: “Hey Taylor, I know you’re a busy gal / but do you ever think about them early days and your country music pals? / Yeah, ol’ Pat Garrett was right by your side, helping you make it through. / Hey Taylor, I’ve been waitin’ on a call from you.”\n\nSeriously, he added, “I wish her all the luck in the world. Although I guess at this point she doesn’t need luck anymore. She has things pretty well in hand. I hope she has continued success as long as she wants it.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Jack Antonoff, pop music’s production king, on Taylor Swift, his new album and the genre that’s ‘about to blow’\n\nThree rainy days before this month’s 66th Grammy Awards, Jack Antonoff sits cross-legged — dry and toasty and sipping his second oat-milk latte — on an oversized sofa in the private recording studio he recently built on a grungy Hollywood side street.\n\n“I hate this weather,” he says as he peers through a soundproofed window he claims would keep us from hearing two cars smashing into each other right out front. “I’m really basic when it comes to weather: I like sun and warmth, and anything besides that causes me dissonance.”\n\nWhat Antonoff doesn’t know at the moment is that at the Grammys he’ll win album of the year for his work as a producer and songwriter on Taylor Swift’s chart-topping “Midnights” and be named producer of the year for the third time in a row. The latter achievement will tie a record set in the mid-1990s by Kenny “Babyface” Edmonds, the groundbreaking R&B auteur whose Tiny Desk Concert is a favorite of Antonoff’s.\n\n“I was just watching him do ‘Change the World,’” he says, referring to the rootsy-soulful Eric Clapton hit produced by Babyface. “Crazy song, man.”\n\nWhat Antonoff does know ahead of the Grammys — knows but can’t talk about as we hide out from the rain — is that he’s already completed another LP with Swift: “The Tortured Poets Department,” which she’ll reveal onstage during the ceremony in a surprise announcement that promptly breaks the internet. Due April 19, it’s the seventh studio album Swift and Antonoff have made together over the last decade (not counting her blockbuster re-recordings of her early work); it’s also sure to extend his reign as perhaps the most in-demand producer in pop music: a technical whiz with a knack for ear-grabbing sounds and a born co-conspirator capable of making artists feel safe.\n\nAmong the albums he’s helped shepherd to varying combinations of commercial success, critical acclaim and awards attention are Lorde’s “Melodrama” and “Solar Power,” St. Vincent’s “Masseduction,” Clairo’s “Sling,” Florence and the Machine’s “Dance Fever,” the 1975’s “Being Funny in a Foreign Language” and Lana Del Rey’s “Norman F—ing Rockwell!” and “Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd,” both of which earned Grammy nods for album of the year. Each has its own quirks, yet all of them can make the intimate feel anthemic and vice versa.\n\n“He’s a genius,” says Natalie Maines of the Chicks, who drafted Antonoff to helm their 2020 comeback disc, “Gaslighter.” “Every day I couldn’t wait to be in the studio with him.” She laughs. “He better work with us again, or I’ll quit.”\n\nBoygenius, Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff\nJack Antonoff, right, and Taylor Swift with the members of Boygenius backstage at the 66th Grammy Awards in February. (Jason Armond / Los Angeles Times)\nFor now Antonoff, 39, is funneling his talent into “Bleachers,” a self-titled album by the New Jersey-based rock group he formed in 2013, shortly before his contributions to Swift’s nine-times-platinum “1989” set him on a path toward pop ubiquity. In the beginning, Bleachers was a vehicle for the neo-New Wave noodling Antonoff would do by himself on his laptop; later, he convened a handful of musicians — including two sax players — and the band became known as a fist-pumping, sweat-spraying, Springsteen-channeling live act. (“Chinatown,” a track from 2021’s “Take the Sadness Out of Saturday Night,” featured the Boss himself.)\n\nThis latest record, the band’s fourth full-length, presents a further evolution: Though the album’s lead single, “Modern Girl,” has a rowdy E Street vibe, the rest of the LP is lusher and more nuanced, with spacious arrangements that blend strummy acoustic folk, tender soft rock and glimmering ’80s R&B.\n\n“To me it feels massively different,” Antonoff says in his studio, which wraps around a small garden designed by the same folks who maintain the grounds of Conway Recording Studios, his favorite place to work in Los Angeles until he got this spot up and running late last year. Decorated in cozy earth tones and lined with banks of vintage synthesizers, the room is new enough that he asks visitors to take off their shoes — “We’re still treating it like a house,” he says — and takes clear pleasure in showing off the pictures and knickknacks on the shelves: a shot of his dad and his uncle in the ’70s, a drawing by the late Daniel Johnston, a framed piece of hotel stationery scrawled with an initial sequencing idea for “Norman F—ing Rockwell!”\n\nA Polaroid of a pair of cowboy boots — Del Rey’s, it turns out — lies on a coffee table, one product of Antonoff’s effort to start taking more old-school photos. “The phone kind of ruined pictures,” he says. “If I point a camera at you, you’re like, ‘Picture!’ If I point this at you,” he adds, lifting his phone, “you’re like, ‘Am I gonna be canceled?’”\n\nJamie Oborne, who manages Antonoff’s career and heads up the band’s record label, Dirty Hit, says that “Bleachers” marks “the first time Jack’s done for himself what he does for so many other people when he produces records.” And there might be something to that in the careful way he frames his singing, selecting just the right textures to draw out the rich emotion in his voice. Yet it’s not merely the sound of “Bleachers” that distinguishes the album but Antonoff’s newly expansive approach to writing for the band.\n\nThe first few Bleachers records, he says today, were almost entirely defined by his experience of grief, which began when his younger sister, Sarah, died of brain cancer when she was 13 and Antonoff was 18. He wrote about her memory and about survivor’s guilt and about what happens as you get further away from trauma but still can’t shake it — “the long COVID of survivor’s guilt,” as he puts it.\n\n“Bleachers” takes a wider view in songs that ponder the absurdities of pop culture and the renewing power of romance; Antonoff attributes the latter, as heard in songs like “Tiny Moves” and “Me Before You,” to his falling in love with the actor Margaret Qualley, whom he married last year in a star-studded wedding not far from where the couple live much of the year in New Jersey.\n\nWas there a part of him that felt like addressing other themes in his music constituted a betrayal of his sister?\n\n“Yeah, and I fought against that,” he says, pulling his knees toward his chest on the couch. “I don’t think the highest version of keeping someone’s memory alive is not living, you know?” Antonoff says that for years the enormity of Sarah’s death led him to conclude that anything going wrong in his life — anger, anxiety, panic attacks — was a result of that tragedy. “And that’s an almost impossible thing to realize isn’t true,” he says. The depth of his connection with Qualley helped open his mind.\n\n“Now I can finally prosecute the 20 years of things that I just swept under the rug of loss,” he says with a laugh. “I feel liberated by starting to take some of my things to the Container Store in my head.”\n\nAntonoff grew up comfortably in New Jersey — his older sister, Rachel, is now a fashion designer — and played in a series of bands in high school and afterward; one of the groups, Steel Train, had a song inspired by his then-girlfriend, Scarlett Johansson. In 2008, he formed a trio called Fun., which went on to score with “We Are Young,” a major radio hit in 2012 that won a Grammy for song of the year; around the same time, he began a five-year relationship with the filmmaker Lena Dunham, which invited his first brush with tabloid celebrity.\n\nAntonoff’s decision not to live full-time these days in L.A. could be seen as a rejection of that kind of fame. He insists it comes down to the inspiration he still pulls from New York and New Jersey — and to the fact that his skin gets too dry if he’s here longer than a few weeks. But he admits that L.A.’s highly competitive pop industry, in which songwriters and producers “are expected to fly into all these rooms and mine the deepest parts of their soul, then throw it out there and go to the next one,” is “kind of bulls—.”\n\n“It’s not how good things are made,” he continues. “Great things are made by a small group of people yes-anding each other all the way to the moon.” It’s an anti-song-factory approach that’s been embraced in Antonoff’s wake by Billie Eilish and her producer-slash-brother, Finneas O’Connell, and by Olivia Rodrigo and her producer, Dan Nigro.\n\nSays Monte Lipman, founder and chief executive of Republic Records, which puts out Swift’s work: “What makes Jack so unique is that he’s never gravitated toward pop music — pop music simply gravitated toward Jack.”\n\nAntonoff thinks of Bleachers’ records and those he makes for his production clients as part of the same fabric; the music reflects his belief that “we’ve reached an interesting moment where it doesn’t feel like there’s many more inventions” — at least compared to the boom in digital recording technology he witnessed when he was younger — “so the most exciting thing you can do is take classic instruments and make them sound like they never sounded.” Mikey Freedom Hart, who plays guitar and keyboards in Bleachers and has appeared all over Swift’s and Del Rey’s albums, says the musicians in Antonoff’s circle like to imagine themselves as a modern-day version of the tight-knit Wrecking Crew of session players who fueled countless pop hits in the ’60s and ’70s.\n\nThe closeness Antonoff feels with his collaborators has cultivated a protective streak that emerges occasionally on social media, where he’s been known to post a salty comment, as when he described Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz as a “herb” after Albarn suggested in an interview with The Times that Swift doesn’t write her own songs.\n\n“I’m a little bitch sometimes,” he allows. “But you come after my friend Taylor, you’re toast to me.” Questioning Swift’s songwriting, he adds, “is like challenging someone’s faith in God. You just don’t go there.” He’s had harsh words for another of Swift’s antagonizers, Kanye West, whom he says “just needs his diaper changed so badly.”\n\nDoes he ever think twice about roasting a well-known musician he might someday want to work with?\n\n“It’s been a long time since I would’ve taken Kanye’s call,” he says with a laugh. “I’m so incredibly bored when someone doesn’t have the sauce anymore, so they go elsewhere to shock. It’s just a remarkable waste of space.”\n\nAsked whose call he’d be more inclined to take, Antonoff says he doesn’t have “a road map in my head for what I will or won’t do.” He decides whether a potential collaboration is right based on a simple reaction: “Am I excited or not?”\n\nBeyond Swift’s “Tortured Poets Department,” about which he stays mum in a phone conversation after the Grammys, he’s working on Del Rey’s next LP, which she’s said will be a country album titled “Lasso.” “We’ve been cooking,” he says. “It’s f—ing brilliant.” (Of the current country craze that’s also drawn Beyoncé and Post Malone toward the genre, Antonoff says, “The bubbling is about to blow — I feel it everywhere.”)\n\nBleachers will also tour this year, including a stop at April’s Coachella festival, and though he’s not at all sure how the band will configure the new album’s quieter, more intricate moments for the stage, he says he finds the task more exciting than worrying. Ditto the prospect of turning 40, which he’ll do at the end of March. Pop music is often thought of as a young person’s game, but Antonoff dismisses that notion.\n\n“To me, you express your age the way you express it. Look at Bob Dylan: ‘Rough and Rowdy Ways’ felt so bitchy and cool,” he says of Dylan’s 2020 album, “whereas when he was young he was being such a little poet.” Antonoff wants to have children with Qualley, but he knows the demands of parenthood will fundamentally alter the life he’s built in music.\n\n“I see that as the next big shake-up,” he says. “The first time in a while I’ll be doing something I have no idea how to do.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "We Talk Taylor Swift, Kanye West And Reverb With Grammy Winner Ken Lewis\nBy LiquidSonics12th March 2024\nKen Lewis - Mixer\nFresh off the back of his Grammy-award for engineering on Album of the Year with Taylor Swift’s ‘Midnights’, we recently had the honour of chatting with renowned record producer and mix engineer Ken Lewis.\n\nKen’s eclectic resume spans over 30 years, boasting iconic credits ranging from Wu Tang Clan, Mary J. Blige and Kanye West to Bruno Mars, BTS, Lady Gaga and many more, firmly cementing his status as a musical luminary.\n\nKen’s journey began at the age of ten when his passion for music was ignited after his parents finally gave him the guitar he’d been begging for. After playing in high school bands, Ken fell in love with the process of recording, creating and producing, attending Berklee College of Music in Boston where he graduated in 1991, moving to New York City in 1993 and recently making the move back to his home state, Ohio.\n\nWe pick things up with Ken from there…\n\nWhat was your first studio gig? \n\nI did two internships in college. I worked as an intern at Downtown Recorders and then at Soundtrack Studios in Boston which got me in the door at Soundtrack New York City. I got an interview there and the owner called up Boston and they gave me glowing reviews, he hired me on the spot and gave me a good starting salary. \n\nWas there some kind of tipping point where you thought, I think I can do this for the rest of my life?\n\nYou know, I don’t think I’ve ever had that one big break. It’s been one foot in front of the other for 32 years now. There have been connective moments that have completely changed the course of my career, like meeting Just Blaze, I did a ton of records with him, and he also introduced me to Kanye West. Without meeting Justin, my history with Kanye probably wouldn’t exist.\n\nYou never know who you’re going to meet and how that’s going to work out. It’s quite often, not the first thing you work on together, it’s the 20th or 30th thing you do, and then that grows into more relationships. I never gave myself a plan B ever for anything, so there was never a question of ‘can I do this?’. It’s ‘I am doing this’. I always thought that I would be the broke musician and my wife would be supporting me and it just turned out that I found my way through the industry and learned how to make great records and found my way to making a good living at it.\n\nI think getting to New York City was a ‘moment’ because I had worked on a couple of label things before that, but I knew when I got to NYC that I was in the middle of label land and I was at a studio that had six rooms when I got there, nine rooms when I left, and they were all booked all the time. There were so many high-level artists coming in and out of that studio, it was just an incredible place to be. I got to learn so many different types of gear. They had API, Neve, and SSL consoles. They had every microphone on earth, all the outboard you could ever want. So, for me, that was a really incredible place to get in to. I got top notch credits and my skill sets just exploded and I feel like that prepared me to go freelance, which I did in 1995. \n\nWhat’s interesting looking at your credits is you don’t seem to have boxed yourself in. You’ve worked with all sorts of artists – Kanye, BTS, Taylor Swift… is that a choice that you’ve made to keep yourself fresh by just mixing it up?\n\nYes, a hundred percent. I’m lucky that I get to mix it up with such high-level artists. That’s the real joy of it. But it’s a blessing and a curse. It’s a blessing because I have all of these amazing skill sets and if I never mix another record in my life, I can pivot to four other things and be fine financially and keep working on the levels that I want and vice versa. I could lose complete income streams and still be fine, so I’m very insulated in the industry. But it’s hard to become the king of anything when everybody knows you for a whole lot of things. So, like, I’ll never be as sought after as Serban [Ghenea], I’ll never be the tip top producer, but I’m going to be one of those ninjas who, when you need somebody with skill sets that nobody else has, and insights and experience that nobody else has, that can bring magic to your project, that’s me.\n\nIs that because you would get bored in one genre? \n\nYes. I think boredom is one possibility, curiosity more likely, but the thing that really galvanized it for me was Kanye West. I started working with Kanye when almost nobody knew Kanye. He had produced one or two hit singles, but that’s all he was known for. He wasn’t known as an artist. I started working with him as a musician back then and started helping him create music and things like that, and then I worked a ton on the College Dropout album, got a writing credit and some production credit on that and then worked with him through to The Life Of Pablo which was the last album that I did anything with him on.\n\nI became the ‘figure it out’ guy for Kanye West. When Kanye had a vision for what he wanted, but nobody in his inner circle could get it, they’d say ‘send it to Ken, he’ll figure it out’. So, for instance, the horn section on All Of The Lights, when Kanye called me for that, he never asked me, ‘hey, Ken, do you know anything about horns?’ That was not an issue for him, and I had never done horn work for him. He just called me, and he sent me this really simple melody line out of a Casio keyboard, and he said, ‘I want this to sound like a marching band in a stadium at halftime’, and that was almost the extent of the conversation. I was like, ‘okay, I’m the figure it out guy, I’m going to just figure this shit out.’ So, all of those horns are completely live, I did the arrangement, I followed the melodies that he wanted, we embellished more. The payoff moment for that was this little mini movie that Kanye did alongside the release of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. I watched it debut on MTV the night before the album came out with my wife and all of a sudden this marching band comes marching onto the field of the stadium, playing All Of The Lights.\n\nThat was just an absolute moment because it was the full circle of ‘okay, I nailed what Kanye wanted, and here’s the visual representation of that actually happening’. Then, to later on hear marching bands in actual stadiums at college football games playing that arrangement is mind blowing. So, when you’re the figure it out guy for Kanye for 15 years, then a lot of other people take notice, and you get crazy calls because of it. \n\nI mixed the entire Wu Tang Clan’s secret album [Once Upon A Time In Shaolin] that they sold at auction to Pharma Bro [Martin Shkreli], and then it went into a government locker, and now it’s owned by PleasrDAO. It’s a full double album. I’ve probably heard it the second most of anybody in the world because I got to mix every song on it. I’d love to hear it again!\n\nHow did the Taylor Swift thing happen? \n\nJack Antonoff [Producer of the Year] tapped me in to do a few things that he didn’t have time for and he knew I was good at. I also worked on the Taylor Swift Lover album for Jack and I’ve worked on Lorde and Bleachers and a whole bunch of other stuff. I have this weird career where sometimes I’m the lead guy, I’m the main producer or I’m the mix engineer and sometimes I’m just the designated hitter for some heavy who just needs something done and knows I’m Mr Reliable. It keeps things interesting because every day is a different day. \n\nAnd while you had all that legendary stuff behind you, did you feel a pressure because everyone knows who Taylor Swift is?\n\nNo, because I’ve been delivering for people of that level for decades. I don’t want to understate it but it’s a day in the life for me. If I put my name on it, if it’s Taylor or an independent, I’m putting 100 percent into it. I like the pressure of big projects. I will be the guy that delivers and that philosophy helped me a lot with groups like BTS who I think I’ve done 48 mixes for now. Again, being reliable and fast and good. \n\nJack has never tapped me in for mixing, but I’m sure I would kill it and he would love it but that’s not what he sees me as. Just like Kanye. Kanye didn’t even know I was a mix engineer for the first two or three years we worked together. \n\nLet’s talk about reverbs. You’ve obviously seen over your mixing career that reverb has kind of gone in and out of fashion, that there are periods where it’s always really tight upfront vocals and other times when they sound like they’re singing in a tunnel.\n\nMany, many times, but I think that was driven more by radio than it is nowadays. When radio was king, there was always a sound to radio. There’s not a unified sound to things nowadays.\n\nIs there a sense of you trying to get a narrative arc for that song when you mix? Obviously, the song is often arranged and written in that way so do you find that you’re following that arc with the mix as well in terms of dynamics and the shape of it?\n\nIn terms of perceived dynamics and slightly in terms of dynamics, I think you can mix really loud and really musically. If you are arranged correctly, your verse is going to be almost the same volume as your chorus, but your chorus is going to add enough to really make it explode. So, I think it’s always song dependent with that kind of stuff. As a mixer, I’m always trying to tap into what the song is telling me. I start my mix by listening to the rough mix five, six times, and just getting a picture in my mind of, ‘okay, this is the song, this is the single thing that I’m mixing and this is my vision for where I think I want to take it’. Which is never exactly where you end up, but it gives you a good compass to start and then it will give you ideas to try along the way that are going to help you lock in that vision for where you want to go.\n\nAnd then I always refer back to the rough mix every now and then for two reasons. One, because there’s probably a reason why that rough sounds that way – they probably connect on some level with it. So, if you’re going to depart from the direction of the rough as a mixer, you’d better be confident in your direction. But also, I always find that even at late stage mixing, the rough often has one or two elements that just got handled better than you did. Even if it’s just a shaker and you listen, and you think ‘their shaker drives the chorus better than mine, let me match that’. I just always try and be conscious of the one single song (instead of all the parts) that I’m mixing and where I hear it going. \n\nHow are you using reverbs generally? When do you reach for the verbs when you’re mixing?\n\nI like to add effects after my foundation is built. So, I may just real rough mix everything into the mix. If I have 80 tracks, those 80 tracks are all going to be in the mix within 20 or 30 minutes and then I’ll start balancing further and I’ll start compressing and EQ-ing, I’ll start adding reverbs and touches here and there and I’ll just start building the palette out further. So, I’ll go from really fast to medium fast to kind of slow to fine tuning and touches, and reverb gets added and tried and taken away all throughout the process.\n\nI’m big on looking for the emotion with what type of reverb you choose. Like a bone-dry in-your-face vocal is going to be a completely different listener experience than a mid-length plate or a long hall. So, for me, you listen to the song and you kind of picture in your mind, ‘what do I think is going to be the best reverb for this?’ and then you just start playing to see if your expectations match, or just play until you stumble across something that’s like ‘the one’. I often scroll presets until the “a-ha!” moment happens.\n\nDo you have go-to verbs or do you start from scratch?\n\nI start from scratch every time. In the olden days, we would put a bunch of reverbs on channels on the console and we would just try each of those. I used to start my mixes with a bunch of reverbs already instantiated. Now, I like to pick as I go, listen and just ask myself ‘how do I hear this vocal? What kind of space do I want to put it in?’ and maybe that’s not reverb at all, maybe that’s just like a little tiny chorusing or pitch spreading or something like that. Or it might be a super short, impactful reverb that just makes it sound bigger and more present, but still in your face. I just try and listen and let it tell me, and be open to being wrong. So, if I try a reverb that I’m sure is going to sound good, I’m still going to try and listen objectively and ask, ‘does it give me that emotion?’ and if not, I’ll just try something else. \n\nKen Lewis StudioWhat kind of LiquidSonics reverbs are you using on your mixes? \n\nSeventh Heaven Pro is probably my main go-to for stereo mixing. I’m using Cinematic Rooms a lot for Atmos. I think I’m actually using Seventh Heaven Pro for Atmos as well now. Those are my two main Atmos reverbs and I just start with those because I put one short and one kind of medium and then I’ll tweak them, if needed, in the mix or copy it to another channel and just open up another verb. But those are just beautiful in Atmos and stereo. You can add a real short reverb to something in Atmos, and it doesn’t feel or sound like reverb, but it sounds so much richer or vibier, or has the emotional impact that you want it to have.\n\nSo you tend to tip between the ambience and the reverb setting in those verbs? \n\nYeah, especially in Atmos because a lot of times you’re looking for really short reverbs or you’re looking to get rid of short reflections or emphasize them sometimes. A lot of times, especially in Atmos, I’m like, ‘early, late, early, late’, and I want to hear what they’re doing and then figure out if the centre is the right or how much of each I want. The other thing that I do with the Atmos reverbs a lot is, if I’m putting a reverb on something that’s in LR that already has a verb on it from the stem, I’ll deactivate LR from Seventh Heaven Pro or Cinematic Rooms and I’ll put the reverb on the rest of immersive field. I also use stereo reverbs a lot in Atmos to add depth or space to a sound in a particular location. \n\nIn terms of presets, most people say they open up Cinematic Rooms and use Amethyst Hall because that’s the one there, and it does the job and they just tweak it. Is that true for you?\n\nThere’s definitely some truth to that and I find that with a lot of plugin companies; they’ve probably worked very hard to make sure that the preset on instantiation is a real gem and I think the Amethyst Hall in Cinematic Rooms is a real gem. I really like the super tight rooms on Cinematic Rooms, I think it’s short room ABCD or something like that *. If I have something that’s just a little bit too dry in the headphones and a little bit too separated from everything, some of those short rooms just really bring things into focus.\n\n* See “Small Room Amb” in the “Ambiences” bank\n\nYou’ve mixed so much stuff. You’ve been around so much great talent. What one piece of advice would you give young men and women who are getting into mixing that you think would stand them in good stead?\n\nI would tell young people on the come-up that credits are much more valuable than money. Money is going to be spent in a month. That credit can last forever. And, you don’t know what you don’t know and don’t get cocky about it.\n\nSo many young record makers have so much talent but refuse to collaborate with, or tap in the people, that could really level them up because they want to do it all themselves. And really, most top levels of this business are really collaborative; people like working with other people. One hundred percent of something that’s mediocre or good, ain’t worth much, but fifty or fifteen percent of something that’s amazing is worth a lot. \n\nOr in your case, a very small percentage of something that’s really big right now (ie. Taylor Swift) is very important, isn’t it?\n\nOh, 100%. Yeah, the value of credits, and that’s a credit that will last forever. I got a bunch of those, I’m really lucky, you’ve got to try and keep your credits fresh if you want to stay working in the industry. The music industry is a fickle bitch, man. They always want to be hiring the top of the food chain. If you’re third tick or fourth tick down, you don’t get hired anywhere near as much as the top tier. That’s just the way it is. The value of credits, that can propel your career or, if you don’t have any, can really slow it down. I came up through a studio where I could get credits and experience before I went freelance. Everybody just wants to be freelance now. I made a whole lot of tea. I cleaned a lot of bathrooms. I ran some crazy errands, and lost so much sleep. Anybody I think who’s really made it to my level in this industry has probably swum through a river of shit to get here. It’s definitely hard work. Luck might get you in a door or two, but keeping that gig is hard work and getting the people that give you that gig to tell their friends about you is hard and that’s really how you get the best work in this business – word of mouth. \n\nBeing a staffer at a studio where I could be anonymous and, at first when I was getting hired as a recording engineer for label sessions, they couldn’t afford a freelancer so they were happy with whoever the studio gave them. I was able to build my experience and my credits in a somewhat safe space before I had to go out and try and build myself as a freelancer, I had three gold and platinum records before I went freelance – people want to do it nowadays with no credits!",

      "Transcript/Content": "Local woman was the original ‘Swiftie’\nDonna B Stinnett by Donna B Stinnett  March 28, 2024 in Local\n\nLocal woman was the original ‘Swiftie’\nThis photo from the album of Adrianne Egan Garber shows her with a young Taylor Swift (right) and Swift's younger brother, Austin. Garber was 14 when she babysat Taylor Swift. (Photo courtesy of Adrianne Egan Garber)\n\nIn a photo album of memories from her life, Adrianne Egan Garber saved some snapshots of two children she baby-sat as a teen-ager growing up in Pennsylvania.\n\nIncluded is a holiday photo card with a hand-written message wishing her a merry Christmas in 1992. It pictures a tow-headed toddler and her younger brother in matching red-and-green plaid outfits.\n\nThat tow-headed toddler is Taylor Swift, now one of the most famous pop music icons in the world.\n\nGarber said her parents were friends with Andrea and Scott Swift, Taylor’s parents, in their Pennsylvania community. The Swift home, and their Christmas tree farm was across the country road, and Garber’s brothers also did small jobs for the farm.\n\nAs a 14-year-old in the early 1990s as well as the families’ friendship and proximity, Garber was a natural choice to baby-sit for the Swift family, which she did for about a year (including one whole summer) before her mom and step-dad, Peggy and Bill Fidler, relocated their family to Henderson.\n\nGarber’s memories of her time with the Swift children include a favorite playtime activity of Taylor’s. The little girl liked to go outside in the field beside their modest house and have Garber spin her around and around.\n\n“She thought that was so much fun,” Garber said.\n\nThough she’s a huge animal lover, Garber remembers being a little bit apprehensive about the Swift family’s Doberman, Asia, until the day she was holding newborn Austin with older sister Taylor sitting right beside her and the dog came up to lean on her legs. Garber considered it a little bonding moment.\n\nAnd she remembers Taylor as a “sweet, thoughtful, fun-loving child.” Garber said the little girl didn’t display any unusal musical talent on her watch, but she did love to be in a “breezeway” area of the house where there were numerous musical instruments.\n\n“She liked to crash around in there and play around with an instrument,” Garber said. “I think her parents gave her free rein.”\n\nIt didn’t seem like anything out of the ordinary.\n\n“They were just a normal family,” she recalls, noting that the Swift family wrote her a “really heartfelt” letter telling her how much they would miss her when the move to Kentucky was about to take place.\n\n“(Andrea Swift) wrote that she was so sorry to see us go,” Garber remembers.\n\nThen they pretty much lost touch except for one isolated time when some of her family members saw Taylor Swift perform at the Wild Horse Saloon in Nashville. By that time, the Swift family had relocated to Nashville to facilitate Taylor’s career.\n\nGarber distinctly remembers the first time she became aware of the fact that something big might be happening for the little girl she’d once baby-sat.\n\nShe was in her sophomore year at the University of Kentucky when she received a phone call from her mom.\n\n“She said ‘You should listen to the radio,’” Garber recalls. “’Taylor Swift has some songs out.’”\n\nThe singer was still pretty young then, but it was already clear that there was a lot of potential for a music career.\n\n“It was so crazy,” Garber said about tuning into the radio. “She was really good.”\n\nShe said it makes her think, especially on Thursdays and Fridays when she works with pre-schoolers at Holy Name School.\n\n“I look at them and wonder ‘Who are you going to be someday?’” she said. “No one could have predicted anything about this little girl.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Fortnight] is a song that I think really exhibits a lot of common themes that run throughout this album. One of which being fatalism, um, longing, pining away lost dreams. You know, I think that, um, it's a very fatalistic album and that there are lots of very dramatic lines about life or death, and I love you it's ruining my life, like, these are very hyperbolic dramatic things to say but it's that kind of album. It's about a dramatic, artistic, tragic kind of take on love and loss, and Fortnight, I've always imagined that it took place in this American town where the American dream you thought would happen to you didn't. You ended up not with the person that you loved and now you have to just live with that everyday wondering what would have been, maybe seeing about and that's a pretty tragic concept, really. So I was just writing from that perspective.''",

      "Transcript/Content": "And then there was the day Taylor Swift walked into Itta Bena with her guitar…\nApril 23, 2024 Debbra Dunning Brouillette\nOn August 8, 2007, Grace Peters got a thrilling piece of news. “When I found out Taylor Swift was going to come to the restaurant to do a photo shoot for a magazine article, I could barely contain my excitement!”\n\nGrace is the daughter of Tommy Peters, who opened the B.B. King Blues Club in Memphis in 1991. His new venture, a speakeasy on the third floor of the building called Itta Bena, had been chosen as the location for the photo shoot for the then up-and-coming 17-year-old Taylor Swift.\n\nToday the venue for that interview and impromptu performance is a almost-hidden delight along Beale Street, with dimly lit interiors and blue-tinted windows, accessed by a flight of stairs at the rear of the building. It serves elevated Southern cuisine with a backdrop of smooth jazz, making it ideal for intimate conversation.\n\nFor true Swifties, it’s also the unlikely place where the teenager rocketing to superstardom shared an intimate performance before she would draw millions of fans into top venues around the world.\n\nTaylor Swift’s Early Career:  Her Star was Just Beginning to Rise\nSwift’s debut single, “Tim McGraw,” had been released the year before, in June 2006. Just a few months before her visit to Itta Bena, she had performed the song at the Academy of Country Music (ACM) Awards. Three months later, she received the Best New Artist award from the Country Music Association (CMA).\n\nThe photo shoot was for Justine, a teen lifestyle magazine based in Memphis, which was doing a cover article for an upcoming issue. (The magazine ceased publishing several years ago.)\n\n“My Mom was friends with the editor,” Grace recalled, “which is how the restaurant became the venue for the photo shoot and interview. It was scheduled during the day, before other guests would arrive for dinner. School hadn’t started back up, so I was able to go.”\n\nTaylor Swift and Justine staff trying on dress for photo shoot.\nTaylor Swift pictured trying on a dress for the photo shoot. (Photo courtesy of Grace Peters)\nThe photo shoot involved lots of changes into several different dresses, supplied by a variety of merchants.\n\n“Taylor loved all of our darlin’ dress picks,” noted one of the Justine editors for the photo shoot. “She even bought a few to take with her on the road.” She wore her own Lucchese boots in most of the photos. Each item of clothing or jewelry was identified in the article, listing company and prices.\n\nAfter the photo shoot wrapped, “Swift sang ‘Our Song,’ another release from her debut album, at my request,” Grace continued. “It was my favorite, and I found it was Taylor’s too.”\n\n“My mom, dad, and a few Justine magazine staff members were also there, but she sang it right to me, one-on-one. She wasn’t there that day to sing, which made it even more special.”\n\nAfterward, someone from Justine interviewed Swift in the kitchen, as she sat next to Grace.\n\nA few hours later, as diners arrived for the evening meal, Taylor Swift was on her way to Orlando, Florida, to play a concert the following evening, August 9, at Amway Arena, along with Brad Paisley, Jack Ingram and Kellie Pickler.\n\n“Taylor was the ‘olive branch’ in our relationship,” Grace confided. “My Dad was a huge music man. He was thrilled about me being excited that this singer I loved could come to his restaurant. Soon after, he bought me a guitar and I started guitar lessons.”\n\nThe following February, he took Grace and her sister to Orlando for Taylor’s Fearless concert. “We got to talk beforehand at the ‘meet and greet’ — and she remembered me!”\n\nNow 31, Grace says she has been a Swiftie from the beginning. “Besides loving her music, I love the way Taylor has always been so gracious, and how she made me feel like I was the only person in the room. She looked me in the eyes, hugged me, and made me feel like we’d been lifelong friends.”\n\nSince the Orlando concert in 2008, Grace has attended four more concerts, in Dallas and Los Angeles. Most recently, on August 5, 2023, Grace celebrated her birthday while seeing Swift perform in Los Angeles as part of the Eras Tour.\n\nSeventeen years after that not-quite 18-year-old Taylor and a barely 15-year-old Grace Peters shared some special moments, Taylor Swift has become a worldwide phenomenon. But Grace Peters will always remember and cherish memories from that day in 2007 — the day Taylor Swift walked into Itta Bena with her guitar.\n\nSpecial thanks to Grace Peters for sharing her story with me, and to Jana Kerr Pettey, Editor of Justine magazine for sharing the magazine article.",

Was she prepared for the avalanche of internet discourse that greeted The Tortured Poets Department? “I almost didn’t think of the scale of it,” confesses Welch, laughing. “There’s the sort of bigness of [Taylor Swift the phenomenon], and then there’s the Taylor I spend time with in the studio, who is just the sweetest and most down to earth.” The pop superstar came to Florence with “a concept and a story” for the track [Taylor has said it’s about the desire to reinvent yourself after heartbreak – some fans have other theories], which is “my favourite way to start songwriting”, Florence says. “We had such a fun time. And then when it came out I was like, ‘Oh, shit!’”\n\nSwift is due to bring her record-breaking Eras tour – which has seen the likes of Phoebe Bridgers and Ice Spice joining her on stage in the US – to the UK this summer. Could Florence be persuaded to break her self-imposed hiatus one more time for another live performance with Taylor? If she could, she’s not telling. “If I was gonna do it, it would be a surprise.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift’s early years — by the people who knew her\nA pet pony, a driven dad and unbridled ambition: Megan Agnew drives from Pennsylvania to Nashville to meet the teachers, classmates, neighbours and musicians who helped shape the singer before superstardom\n\nEvery few months, Scott Swift would hit the phones. The agenda: his teenage daughter, Taylor. Most likely sitting in his study at the family home in Hendersonville, near Nashville, Tennessee, overlooking the Cumberland River, he caught up with her former teachers, his business buddies, family friends, session musicians who had recorded demos with her and the producers who had mixed them, giving them a detailed download of information about his daughter’s ascent.\n\nScott talked well. A third-generation banker and former radio salesman, he updated them on which songs she had cut (I am told he spent $10,000 on building her a recording studio at their home); which singles were coming out next (by the age of 15, Taylor had a record deal with a company in which Scott had bought a 3 per cent stake); where she was touring (he had bought Cher’s former tour bus for her); and the awards for which she needed votes. Nashville, after all, was an industry town where careers were built on fresh young faces and smoky old networks.\n\nAnd — it worked. Today Swift, 34, is a billionaire, more of a phenomenon than a pop star, who sells so many concert tickets she shifts national economies. She arrived in the UK on tour on Friday. Her albums (11 original studio albums, 4 rerecorded albums and 4 live albums) are devoured immediately by her insatiable fans, the Swifties. She has sold the equivalent of five million albums this year alone, making her the top-selling artist of 2024, and has become the first artist in US history to sell 100 million album-equivalent units — the industry measure in the streaming era.\n\nFor the past few weeks I have been driving the Taylor Swift trail through the US to try to understand how she came to be: through Pennsylvania, where she was raised; New Jersey, where the family spent long summers; and Nashville, where they moved when Taylor was 14, to help her make it big. What I found was a story of megawatt talent, intense family nurturing and canny investment; of magic and money; of how a star was born — and then made bigger and bigger and bigger.\n\n“What do I do with this child?” Scott reportedly asked a family friend, stunned by the sparkling talent and determination of his young daughter, who arrived in this world dead-set on stardom, who chatted endlessly and felt things so deeply she couldn’t bear the death of birds she found in the garden; and who wrote poetry so relentlessly it was as if she couldn’t stop.\n\nThe hills of Pennsylvania, just northwest of Philadelphia, are rolling rather than mighty, populated with rust-coloured barns, stables, worn American flags and copses of ancient oaks. Swift’s first home — Pine Ridge Farm, a former Christmas tree farm near Reading, where she spent the first decade of her life — is a Norman Rockwell painting of a place.\n\nHer father, Scott, now 72, grew up nearby. He was a financial adviser at the investment firm Merrill Lynch. Swift’s mother, Andrea, now 66, was a marketing executive born into a wealthy family who grew up between Singapore and Houston, Texas. Andrea’s father was the president of a construction company, her mother an opera singer. Andrea met Scott at a drinks party and they married in 1988. Taylor was the Swifts’ first child — born on December 13, 1989 — followed two years later by Austin, 32, who was quieter but cheekier.\n\nI pull up outside the Swifts’ old farm — a modest clapboard house overlooking the paddocks where Taylor kept a pony. Scott kept the farm as a hobby, mowing the meadows before work. Upstairs, in a corner room, was where she asked for three books to be read and five songs to be played to her every night. “We’re not supposed to talk to anybody but People magazine,” say the couple who live there today — referencing a popular celebrity tabloid in the US. And they have been instructed by Swift’s team? “Yes,” they say, closing the door.\n\nTaylor went to a Montessori kindergarten and then Wyndcroft, a private school in nearby Pottstown, where the Swifts were known for their wealth. According to family friends they drove a Chevrolet Suburban — an SUV fit for the secret service — sent Christmas cards showing their impressive holidays and brought their daughter’s pony to school for show and tell. They were also known for their generosity. Each year the people who had donated the most money to Wyndcroft had their names published and the Swifts were often at the top. The family would also give teachers the keys to their holiday home as a thank-you present.\n\nScott seemed to know everybody, his friends often becoming clients and vice versa. One was James MacArthur, famous for playing Dan “Danno” Williams in Hawaii Five-O, with whom he apparently holidayed. I’m told Andrea played tennis at the Hillcrest Racquet Club in Reading, a members’ club where she often socialised.\n\nMaureen Pemrick, 77, Swift’s teacher at Wyndcroft in first grade, says the first thing she noticed about Taylor was her wild curls — “She was strikingly pretty” — and her animated chatter. “She was a little sunbeam who just bounced around,” Pemrick says. One afternoon when it was time to go home, Swift suggested that the class had a group hug. “She gathered the children and started squeezing them together,” Pemrick says. “And from then on she was like that.”\n\nOthers remember her as dreamy but solid in confidence. “I want to be a stockbroker,” Swift wrote in her yearbook at six years old, “because my dad is one.” By second grade that had changed to “Singer”.\n\n“Taylor was a determined little thing,” says Barbara Kolvek, 78, who was a music teacher at Wyndcroft. When Swift was given the part of Freddie Fasttalk in the play The Runaway Snowman, she went to Kolvek’s office every lunchtime to practise her solo. “She didn’t care that she had to play a boy. She wanted to do it. And so she did.”\n\nDown the road from Wyndcroft lives Barbara Lenzi, 75, an art teacher who has taught there for 45 years and who had Swift in her class for four years. “We’re huggers!” warns Lenzi, who has peroxide-dyed hair with pink tips, glittering flip-flops and iridescent nails. So is Nancy Boerner, 79, the cafeteria manager at Wyndcroft for 26 years, who has joined Lenzi to meet me.\n\n“Taylor was the type of child you were just magnetised towards,” Lenzi says.\n\nSwift was adored at school, they say. “I used to see her walk through that kitchen every day,” Boerner says, “with her smile and she would say” — she puts on a sing-song voice — “ ‘Hi, Mrs Nancy!’ And then she was off, ‘Bla bla bla bla.’ She’d always have something sweet to say. Always.”\n\n“She was confident — the whole family was — but never too much,” Lenzi says. “Just the way she walked, never looking shy.” “The curls boppin’!” Boerner adds.\n\n“I’m going to show you something,” Lenzi says, switching on an ancient TV in her snug. “Open sesame,” she says to the machine, popping a CD into a slot. There, in front of us, is a 13-year-old Taylor Swift, on stage at Wyndcroft on a visit to her old school. “I’ve been a lot of lonely places,” she sings, a song she wrote, “being here on the outside, looking in nobody ever lets me in.” After the performance she takes questions from the infant crowd. A water bottle appears, which she takes without looking. “Isn’t she just ador-baby!” Lenzi says.\n\nAround three times a week until her early teens, Andrea took her daughter to Berks Youth Theatre Academy after school. Swift was the natural star: she played Sandy in Grease, Maria in The Sound of Music. “She was definitely the most gifted,” says Marjorie, 56, whose children were in the same group. “She stuck out. Once she was on stage, you couldn’t take your eyes off her.”\n\nSwift gave out wallet-sized photos of herself as Sandy to the kids in the years below her at school, attended a performing arts summer camp run by Britney Spears and sang the national anthem at local baseball games on school nights.\n\nGena Levengood, 32, was two years behind Swift at the school. Levengood once asked Swift if she was going to audition for American Juniors, an American Idol spin-off for children. “She said she considered it but decided not to, because there was a line in the contract about not being able to release an album within a certain number of years.”\n\nAt about nine years old Swift moved schools to Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School in West Reading — teachers say to be closer to theatre rehearsals. The Swifts moved house into the same town. I drive up the hill to the historic Dutch-style home, with its pillars, balconies and perfectly preened lawn. From the age of 11 Swift learnt to play the guitar in a room on the side of the house. She was taught two or three times a week for three hours after school by Ronnie Cremer, 57, a tech support guy by day who was introduced to the Swift family by his brother, who ran the youth theatre.\n\n“I said I’d teach her what I know,” Cremer says. “She was sweet and kind and eager. She was never a guitar virtuoso, but the idea was to teach her how to project into a microphone and play as if on autopilot — to allow her to perform.” They listened to the Beatles, analysing the different band members’ writing styles, and she learnt to put chords to her own lyrics in her notebook.\n\nThe parents “made a fuss” over their daughter, who they called “T” or “Tay” or “Tay-Tay”. “Scott was the cash guy,” Cremer says. “He could sell ice to the Eskimos. Andrea was the one who kept Taylor on point. She had her eye on the prize.”\n\nLater, Cremer was threatened with legal action by Swift’s team — which he says was dropped — for creating a website called ITaughtTaylorSwift.com. Today he says he has been “written out” of her biography.\n\nEveryone I spoke to talked about the consistently close bond Swift had with her mother. “There were times when, in middle school and junior high, I didn’t have a lot of friends,” she told the Great American Country network in 2008. “But my mom was always my friend. Always.”\n\nHalf an hour’s drive north, at exit 19 of interstate 78, is a petrol station and sheepskin shop owned by a man called Pat Garrett, who is, in his words, “as old as water”. Over the road is a stage in a field, the Pat Garrett Amphitheater, where he holds country music concerts, and next door he used to have a bar, the Pat Garrett Roadhouse, where he put on karaoke competitions. “Everything is Pat Garrett around here,” he says with a smile.\n\nWe walk through the shop, past a platinum album by Swift, through his workshop and its scraps of fur — “Skins and songs, that’s what I do” — and into his office. “I made that vest for the girl up there,” he says, pointing at a photo of a glamour model in a gilet, adding: “There’s nothing underneath.”\n\n“Anyway,” he continues, “one week they showed up — 11-year-old Taylor and a whole gang of her people for the karaoke competition. Whoever won got to open the show at the Amphitheater. She kept getting better, so she won — and so she opened.”\n\nShe played with Garrett’s band at fairs and country music festivals in front of thousands of people, saying: “Hi everybody, I’m Taylor!” “She had a little bit of showbusiness in her,” he says. Her notebook, he claims, was filled with pages of her own autograph. “But she did good.”\n\nOne day he says Scott came in, not knowing what to do next with his daughter. “I told him, ‘Up here in Hershey they make bars. In Detroit they make cars. And in Nashville,’ ” Garrett lowers his voice, “ ‘they make stars. Move to Nashville.’ And he just kind of nodded. The rest is history, I guess.”\n\nThe Swifts spent weeks of the summer at their holiday home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, a small coastal town on a spit, the Atlantic on one side, a calm basin of water on the other. It’s a perfect little spot, with old-timey homes on the water — for sale in the estate agent’s window for $6 million — crêperies and ice cream parlours. It is Springsteen country. During the long, hot summer days Swift would walk through town, her guitar slung across her back, much to the judgment of the local girls. “I think Taylor made herself known here,” says one of them, who still lives there.\n\nAndrea handed New Jersey neighbours Swift’s early demos and would ring the local café, Coffee Talk, to ask if her daughter could sing at their open-mike nights.\n\n• Taylor Swift’s tour has made $1bn but how much will she get?\n\nTheir former home has been knocked down and rebuilt, renamed Swift Waters. Lois Hamilton, 75, an old family friend of the Swifts who lives next door, invites me in. We walk through her living room and past the stone fireplace where an eight-year-old Swift opened her first guitar when she came over one Christmas. “Oh my God!” she said in a home video, surrounded by wrapping paper, “I. Am. Happy.”\n\n“She was very bright,” says Hamilton on the deck at the back of the house. The Swifts’ old garden is next door, backing onto the still water. They had a hot tub on the patio, a jetty with a boat from which they waterskiied and two jet skis. They were also members of the sailing club.\n\nSwift was “cute and confident” but she didn’t have a lot of friends, Hamilton says. “She was more solitary, very happy in her own room.” Instead she would sit on the decking and sing out across the water. “Constantly singing, constantly writing, then singing what she was writing.”\n\nJim Hand is the third generation to own Fred’s Tavern & Liquor Store, five minutes down the road, and has known Scott Swift for much of his life. “When Taylor was young, the family came over for dinner and the kids were all swimming,” Hand says. “They [Swift’s parents] asked me if I had the Disney channel and I said no. There was some country singer on that was Taylor’s idol — and so they got up and they left.”\n\nScott, he says, still manages his investment portfolio. “I couldn’t trust anyone any more than I trust him,” Hand says. “If he came to me and said, ‘Hey, I need $100,000,’ I’d borrow $100,000 and give it to him. And he would pay it back.”\n\nIn the school holidays, when Swift was 11, her parents took her to Nashville’s Music Row, where she went knocking on the doors of record labels handing out demo CDs. “I would say, ‘Hi, I’m Taylor. I’m 11. I want a record deal — call me,’ ” she told Entertainment Weekly in 2008.\n\nAged 13 she was signed to RCA — a Sony Music Entertainment subsidiary — on a development deal, the youngest songwriter in the label’s history. And by 14 the Swifts had moved to Hendersonville, Tennessee, a town 15 miles northeast of Nashville, once the home town of Johnny Cash.\n\nCremer, the guitar teacher, says the family flew him from Pennsylvania to build a studio for Taylor in their new home when they first moved in, giving him about $10,000 for equipment. In the driveway, in subsequent years, was Cher’s tour bus, which they had renovated, installing a sign in bronze script that read: “Never, Never, Never Give Up”.\n\nSwift made an entrance when she first arrived at Hendersonville High School, says a former classmate, telling people she was going to be a star. “We kind of rolled our eyes because, being in Nashville, we hear that a lot,” she says. “It was just such a strong statement for someone of that age.”\n\nAlmost immediately she started dating an older boy. He was popular and had a “preppy look with a country flair” — he would fray the corners of his cap and stick a fishing hook through it. Within months, however, their relationship had ended.\n\nSoon after that it was the school talent competition and Swift got up on stage to perform Teardrops on My Guitar, a song she had written about him. “She’d better hold him tight, give him all her love,” she sang in front of the whole school, her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend. “Look in those beautiful eyes and know she’s lucky, ’cause he’s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.” It was ballsy. “Everyone was pretty taken aback,” the classmate says. “Like — she had just come out of nowhere.”\n\nMany, however, thought she was “a bit of a brat”, from the moneyed side of town and modelling clothes for Abercrombie & Fitch. At 16, Swift bought a Lexus SC430 convertible, the car driven by Regina George, the meanest girl in Mean Girls.\n\nToday it is thought that Swift’s parents still spend time in Hendersonville as well as at a home just outside Tampa, Florida, where they invite family friends for long weekends. Swift, I am told, calls them from her treadmill, singing her set list and running, rehearsing for her current 152-show tour.\n\nIn Nashville, Swift’s record label paired her with songwriters and producers. One was Angelo Petraglia, 70, a New Yorker whose work with Kings of Leon won a Grammy. “I was, like, oh my God, they’re bringing over a 14-year-old girl,” Petraglia recalls. “I didn’t know how to write with a 14-year-old girl.”\n\nHe called his friend and writing partner, Robert Ellis Orrall, 69, who had a similar-aged daughter and agreed to make a trio. “But it was incredible to write with her,” Petraglia says. “She had no fear. None at all. She seemed to know who she was already — she was Taylor Swift, even back then.” It was a confidence, he says, that never quite tipped into precociousness. “You can get plenty of people coming in here feeling a little too much of themselves, but she wasn’t like that at all,” he says. “She just knew what she wanted.”\n\nThe three of them wrote in after-school sessions, which she would always lead. “Between Angelo and I, we had over 100 years of experience,” Ellis Orrall says, “but I remember Angelo threw out a line and she just said, ‘Hmm, I dunno, Angelo, it sounds a little trite.’ And it was, like, ‘Boom! Shot down by the kid!’ Out of ten songs, one of hers would be perfection. Nothing could make it any better.” And every year the ratio has only got higher, he says.\n\nDespite the quantity of songs they cut — about 25 — the label told her they needed 60 days to evaluate her when the contract ended, according to Ellis Orrall. After a family “huddle” between Andrea, Scott and Taylor, they walked away. “It was extraordinary. The biggest mistake in the history of the record label.”\n\nWith no label, Ellis Orrall suggested to the Swifts that they put together a press kit to hand out at a showcase at the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, a haven for songwriters. He had a gig coming up and so he invited her to play. “That night we got her a record deal,” he says. Scott Borchetta — formerly of Universal Music Group and now setting up his own company, Big Machine Records — was in the audience, and “had found the one person he could build a label around”. Swift was 15. According to documents seen by Music Business Worldwide, Scott Swift bought shares in Big Machine at the time worth $500,416.66, thought to be a stake of 3-5 per cent. Swift’s self-titled debut album was released in October 2006 and became the longest-charting album on the Billboard 200 of the decade, seven times platinum.\n\nUntil — again — she walked away. “For years I asked [Big Machine], pleaded for a chance to own my work,” she wrote in a blog post. In 2018 she left the label for the Universal Music Group, which gave her ownership over her music.\n\nIn June of the following year, Borchetta announced he was selling the company to the entrepreneur Scooter Braun for about $300 million, a deal that included Swift’s back catalogue; her father, as a shareholder, is said to have made $15.1 million from the deal. Swift accused Braun of “incessant, manipulative bullying”; Braun told Variety in 2021 that her reaction was “very confusing and not based on anything factual”. In 2020 the rights were sold again, to a private equity company. Swift, angry and determined, set about rerecording her first six albums — an act of brilliant business acumen, propelling her old songs back into the charts.\n\nToday she has money ($1.1 billion, according to Bloomberg); awards (14 Grammys, 39 Billboard Music Awards and an Emmy); Spotify streams (around 110 million listeners every month); and an A-list boyfriend, the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl winner Travis Kelce. Right now she is in Edinburgh on her Eras tour. Scott is probably on the tour bus too, the father linked to ten companies affiliated with his daughter, including merchandising and rights management; Andrea as well, described by the singer as her “guiding force”, who has a role in “every decision I make”; and maybe Austin too. “I always joke that we’re a small family business,” she told Time magazine in December last year.\n\nAnd so just know that, when Swift is on stage in front of 100,000 people and the lights are flashing and there are sequins and dance routines and 44 songs and 10 acts and the ticket sales are pumping up the economy, this was always, always the plan.",

      "Transcript/Content": "[Excerpt] The Secret of Gracie Abrams & Taylor Swift: How Their Partnership Is Lighting a Fire Under the Rising Star’s Career (Literally)\nThe 24-year-old Eras Tour opener's sophomore album arrives June 21, featuring a duet with that trek's headliner and a sound big enough to fill the stadiums they've been playing together.\n\nBy Hannah Dailey\n\n06/18/2024\n\nSomewhere on Gracie Abrams’ camera roll is a video of Taylor Swift in the pop superstar’s kitchen in Tribeca, deliriously extinguishing a bonfire threatening to consume her center island.\n\nBehind the lens, the 24-year-old singer-songwriter cry-laughs as her childhood hero works fearlessly to save them from danger. They’d both distantly heard the candle fall over earlier that night, but Swift had assured Abrams it was probably one of her cats thumping around. It’s well past 6 a.m., after a night of dinner and drinks – heavy on that second thing — when the fire finally goes out.\n\n“She was such a legend – I don’t know how at this hour or in our state she knew what to do,” Abrams raves to Billboard six months later over Zoom. “We both had an insane cough from the fire extinguisher fumes for weeks.”\n\nThe pair had just finished co-writing “Us,” the crown jewel of the California native’s 13-track sophomore studio album The Secret of Us – due out this Friday (June 21) — when the fiasco occurred. Before that, they’d spent the night previewing songs from Abrams’ new record and the 34-year-old hitmaker’s The Tortured Poets Department for each other before either project had even been announced. Abrams recalls singing and dancing “like theater kids” to “But Daddy I Love Him” and lying on the floor in disbelief after hearing “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,” after which they started listening to instrumentals made by their mutual collaborator and friend Aaron Dessner.\n\n“Something caught our ear at the same time very hard and fast,” Abrams says. “So we ran to the piano and started writing this song … I used to fantasize about that kind of a thing as a kid.”\n\n“Us” ended up being the ribbon that tied together the material Abrams had been dreaming up with Dessner at his famed Long Pond Studios last year, after spending the summer opening for Swift’s Eras Tour, a role she’ll reprise on select dates in North America later this fall. Shortly after their near-death experience, the two women headed upstate to record the duet with the 48-year-old National founder, who recalls: “It was just really fun to watch the chemistry of Gracie and Taylor bouncing off each other, Gracie in total wonder and awe watching how Taylor records and produces her vocal performances and builds the world.”\n\n“Taylor’s brilliant at synthesizing a whole story,” Dessner continues over Zoom, the wooden panels of Long Pond’s interior making up his backdrop. “[That song] just brought everything [about Gracie’s album] into focus in a beautiful way.”\n\n",

      "Transcript/Content": "Pro Wrestling Icon Jeff Jarrett Says Taylor Swift Watched His Daughters During Wife’s Cancer Battle\nBy Daniel Trainor  July 8, 2024\n\nPro wrestling legend Jeff Jarrett gushed about the grace of a young Taylor Swift during a difficult time for his family. \n\nDuring an appearance on WREG’s Live at 9 on Friday, July 5, the WWE Hall of Famer, 56, called Swift, 34, a “friend of the family” who was “very good to our family during a very, very dark period.”\n\nJarrett — who now competes for All Elite Wrestling — said the pop star would spend time with his three daughters while his wife and the girls’ mother, Jill Gregory, was battling breast cancer.\n\n“Taylor was like a big sister and came over and took the girls baking cookies and just kind of hung out at the house,” Jarrett recalled. “I can’t say enough good things about Taylor.”\n\nAyesha and Steph Curry and Lindsay Lohan and More Surprising Celeb BFFs\nRelated: Ayesha and Steph Curry and Lindsay Lohan and More Surprising Celeb BFFs\nGregory eventually died in May 2007, seven months after the release of Swift’s self-titled debut album.\n\nWhile Swift’s profile has certainly exploded since those days, Jarrett has enjoyed keeping tabs on the singer. \n\n“She’s just a sweetheart. I still call her ‘our girl’ and now she’s up hanging in the NFL circles,” Jarrett gushed, referencing Swift’s relationship with boyfriend Travis Kelce. \n\nJarrett was also quick to point out that Swift made the gesture out of the kindness of her heart without any money exchanging hands.\n\n“I can tell you this right now, she was never on the Jeff Jarrett payroll,” he said. “So, technically not a babysitter.”\n\nThe bond between Swift and Jarrett’s three daughters — Joslyn, Jaclyn and Jerlyn — was on full display when Jaclyn appeared in the music video for Swift’s song “Mine” in 2010. \n\nRelated: Mercedes Mone Says There is ‘No Competition’ Between AEW and WWE, Blames People ‘On the Internet’ (Exclusive)\n“The ‘Mine’ video is so creative and my daughter Jaclyn looked like a little Taylor,” Jarrett recalled to Fightful in 2011. “We were out on the lake, Taylor pulled up and, as bold as she always is, was just like, ‘I want Jaclyn in the video.’”\n\nJarrett agreed, so the family traveled to Maine to film the video. “[You] had to turn over your cell phone on set and all that stuff. It was a good experience for the kids,” Jarrett remembered.\n\nIn harkening back to the music video, Jarrett also used it as an opportunity to gush about the mega-star who has meant so much to his family. \n\n“Not only is she uber-creative as an artist, she thinks like a businesswoman,” he said. “Those two skill sets combined, you rarely see. She deserves all the success she has.”",

      "Transcript/Content": "It was my second session with Taylor. The first one was [1989's] \"I Know Places,\" and she sent me a voice memo. I was looking for a house in Venice [California], because we were spending so much time in L.A. So that whole memory is attached to me migrating back to Los Angeles. \n\nBut I knew what she was talking about, because I lived in New York, and I remember the feeling — endless possibilities, all the different people and races and sexes and loves. That was her New York chapter. She was so excited to be there. If you never lived there, and especially if you get there and you've got a little money in the pocket, it is so exhilarating.\n\nIt was me just kind of witnessing her brilliant, fast-paced, lyrical wizardry. [Co-producer] Max [Martin] and I had a conversation nine months later at the GRAMMYs, when we had literally just won for 1989. He kind of laughed, he pointed to all the other producers on the album, and he's like, \"If she had, like, three more hours in the day, she would just figure out what we do and she would do it. And she wouldn't need any of us.\" \n\nAnd I still think that's true. Some people are just forces of nature in and among themselves, and she's one of them. She just blew me away. She's the most talented top liner I've ever been in a room with, bar none. If you're talking lyric and melody, I've never been in a room with anyone faster, more adept, knows more what they want to say, focused, efficient, and just talented.",

That one, to me, was just the ultimate. It vacillates so much emotionally that I felt like it was truly what it’s like to be alive right now. So much of it is people just put out things that are definitive. Right now, it's like, \"I'm hurt, I'm mad, I'm sweet,\" \"I'm pissed, I'm joyful, I'm hateful.\" That album—because it's this crazy journey of love, lost love, betrayal, and hurt, and then even the escapism chapter with \"Florida!!!\" which is one of my favorite parts—I see it as our opus. It's a whirlwind. It was a whirlwind to make it.\n\nI love it so much for that reason, because the only true goal when making an album is to capture the feeling of the moment. It's the only way you can make an album. For me, an album takes about a year for it to settle into where it's actually living and not just buzzing. But I learned a lot. It had me writing a little bit, just even in my own stuff, a little more flipping in and out of emotions, like one would in their head. TTPD moves quickly into different emotional territory, which I think is how a lot of us are living. I think that's why so many people are listening to it.\n\nIs there a sonic direction or genre that you'd want to explore with Taylor that you haven't?\nI never know until we do it. I don't really plan. Everything always happens in the moment in the room. I can have thoughts and feelings of like, \"This would be cool, that would be cool,\" but I always find it clouds me in understanding where they're at. ",

I got the vocal from them basically. The label or Taylor (whatever it was, I wasn't in the political sphere of that), they didn't feel like it was happening, so they said, \"We'd like Dann to do his take on it\". [Nathan] gave me the vocal, and because the vocal was a good vocal, I kind of I just said, \"Do you want me to do what I would do?\". They said yes, so I cut it once. The song is really a long song, I think it still is, but it was longer so I just suggested to edit some things out and Taylor was cool with it.

In a webchat with fans at the time, Swift said she wrote all of the album’s 14 songs herself, some in the early hours of the morning during touring. “It didn’t really happen on purpose. It just sort of happened that way,” she wrote.\n\nSpeak Now is a very personal work, with the Pennsylvania-born singer-songwriter basing the concept of the album around letting out her feelings – and at length. Some of the songs are more than six minutes long and the shortest is still nearly four minutes.\n\nSwift described album opener “Mine” as “a song that is about kind of my tendency to run from love.” “Back To December” was supposedly about actor Taylor Lautner, whom she left after a brief relationship in 2010. Swift said it “was about a person who was incredible to me, just perfect to me in a relationship, and I was really careless with him. So this is a song full of words that I would say to him, that he deserves to hear.”\n\nSwift, who was 20 when the album was released, on October 25, 2010, does not specify the names of her song subjects but it was widely reported that the scathing “Dear John” was about singer John Mayer. The anguished lines “Don’t you think I was too young to be messed with?/The girl in the dress/Cried the whole way home” are heartfelt and raw.\n\n“I second-guess and overthink and rethink every single thing that I do,” Swift said at the time. Though the songs on Speak Now are highly introspective they packed a powerful punch for her young fans. On “Never Grow Up” she sings a personal song of regret, while “Enchanted” showcases Swift’s ability to capture the beguiling emotions of falling in love. Elsewhere, the pained words of “Mean” (about being “knifed” in a review by a critic) are set against some wonderfully jaunty bluegrass fiddle from Rob Hajacos.\n\nSpeak Now is a musically adventurous album on which Tom Bukovac shines on electric guitar. On “Last Kiss,” South African-born Nick Buda, who had played on Swift’s first two albums after being introduced to the teenage star by multi-instrumentalist producer Nathan Chapman, said there was an air of real excitement when they were recording the album. “Even at 15 she knew what she wanted,” said Buda. “She would say, ‘I didn’t feel it on that, let’s do another one,’ and she knew what was needed… She is awesome to work with and super-appreciative of her players. There was a real chemistry involved in this record.”\n\nTheir desire to get exactly the sound they wanted extended to changing Buda’s modern drum kit to a vintage one on some choruses in order to get a different tone from some of the bombastic “teenage rock band” sound. Buda recalled that, despite her age, Taylor was already at the top of her game. “The songs were so well written that very rarely did they go past a third take,” he said.\n\nThough Speak Now was pipped to the Grammy award for Best Country Album by Lady A’s Own The Night, it was a commercial triumph. The album debuted at No.1 on the Billboard charts after selling more than a million copies in its first week, and has since sold nearly five million copies.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Zooey Deschanel's Taylor Swift Video Takes Internet by Storm\nPublished Nov 21, 2024 at 12:16 PM EST\nBy Billie Schwab Dunn\nPop Culture and Entertainment Reporter\n\nZooey Deschanel has gone viral after posting a video of herself at a Taylor Swift concert in Canada and using audio from an episode of New Girl for the clip.\n\nThe actor attended Swift's sold-out Eras Tour show at Toronto's Rogers Centre on Saturday with her fiance, Jonathan Scott from Property Brothers. Law and Order: SVU's Mariska Hargitay and her husband, fellow actor Peter Hermann, were also in attendance.\n\nDeschanel filmed herself in the audience at Swift's record-breaking tour. At the beginning of the video, the camera was on Deschanel's face while she played a snippet of her New Girl character Jess saying, \"I just wanted to listen to Taylor Swift alone.\" Then, Deschanel panned across to the audience before showing Swift on stage singing her song \"Lover.\"\n\nThis audio clip is from Season 2 of the hit sitcom after Jess broke up with her boyfriend Sam. This then resulted in her crying and listening to sad songs, including tracks from Swift.\n\n\"Me 🤝 Taylor Swift,\" Deschanel captioned the post. At the time of writing, it had more than 3.8 million plays. Newsweek emailed a spokesperson for Swift and Deschanel for comment on Thursday.\n\nScott also posted a video to Instagram from the night, writing in the caption: \"What a once in a lifetime experience. I think we got serious parent points for this. Thank you to the amazing #Swifties who gave our daughter bracelets! It made her first concert experience so special.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time that Deschanel and Swift have had a crossover, as the two women previously worked together when the singer made a cameo on New Girl. Swift appears in the episode \"Elaine's Big Day,\" which aired as the Season 2 finale in May 2013.\n\nDeschanel discussed her experience working with the pop superstar during an appearance on an episode of The Mess Around. This is a New Girl rewatch podcast hosted by Deschanel's former costars Hannah Simone and Lamorne Morris, and the episode aired on October 1. The actor said that, while Swift \"wasn't on set very long,\" the two of them shared a hair and makeup trailer.\n\n\"If anyone ever says anything mean about her, I'm so mad because she is such a nice person,\" Deschanel said. \"I've never seen her be anything but absolutely so lovely and down to earth.\"\n\nDeschanel also said that she, like her New Girl character, is a dedicated Swiftie.\n\n\"Let's set the record straight that Taylor is awesome,\" Deschanel said. \"Everything that you imagine her to be that you hope she is, she is.\"\n\nToronto marks the second-to-last Canadian city on Taylor's schedule, with Vancouver next before the tour wraps up its epic run on December 8.",

Swift has yet to publicly comment on the situation.\n\nThe Gossip Girl star sued Baldoni, his production company Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel, crisis publicist Melissa Nathan and more in December for alleged sexual harassment and a retaliatory smear campaign.\n\nBaldoni, meanwhile, filed a countersuit of $400 million in January against Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, their publicist Leslie Sloane and Sloane's PR firm Vision PR, Inc. claiming that Lively took measures to control the film, accusing them of defamation and extortion.\n\nHe also sued the New York Times for $250 million accusing them of libel, among other claims, over its Dec. 21 article detailing Lively's complaint against him. \n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nLate last month, Swift was mentioned in Baldoni's latest complaint, when Lively referred to the musician as \"one of her dragons\" in an alleged text exchange following an interaction he describes with Swift at Lively and Reynolds' New York home about a script change.\n\nBaldoni had been \"summoned\" to meet at the couple's penthouse where Swift arrived and had \"began praising Lively’s script\" during his visit, according to the complaint. \"Baldoni understood the subtext: he needed to comply with Lively’s direction for the script,\" the complaint claims.\n\nHe didn't need \"Reynolds and her megacelebrity friend to pressure him,\" the complaint states, and in the alleged text exchange, Baldoni told Lively that he liked her changes. The actress then allegedly referred to herself as Khaleesi from Game of Thrones and called her husband and Swift her \"dragons.\"\n\nUnless Lively and Baldoni reach a settlement, their trial is scheduled for March 2026.\n\nSwift previously showed her support for It Ends with Us by allowing her 2020 song \"my tears ricochet\" to be part of the soundtrack.\n\nLively and Swift's friendship goes back several years. Swift had mentioned the names of Lively and Reynolds' children in her song \"Betty\" and is also the godmother to daughters Betty, James and Inez. (The couple also have a fourth child, infant son Olin.)\n\nMost recently in October, Lively and Reynolds, 48, had a double date night with Swift and her boyfriend Travis Kelce in New York City.",

Her sparkly one-shouldered Vivienne Westwood dress was complement by a suite of ruby-spangled Lorraine Schwartz jewelry, featuring over 60 carats of natural rubies throughout a pair of waterfall earrings and two rings, reveals a very personal bejeweled Easter egg adding another 15 carats of natural rubies to the total.\n\nSwift donned a dainty golden leg chain draped below her dress’s hemline, studded with rubies. As it turns out, Swift and her stylist Joseph Cassell personally worked with Schwartz to design and execute the piece, which featured a teeny tiny letter T charm dangling from the end of one of the strands.\n\n“She has ideas that she really wants to bring to life, and then we help her bring it to life in our jewels,” Schwartz told Vanity Fair, adding that Swift had a clear vision from the start for the chain peeking out from beneath the dress’s hem, letter charm and all. “It really was her collab with me.”\n\nThe charm was studded with rubies on both sides, and the warm, rosy gold of the chain played well with Swift’s skin tone, letting the detail be both subtle and notable.\n\nSwift also wore Schwartz’s designs at last year’s Grammys ceremony, where she chose a dramatic choker with a watch face, surrounded with black diamonds, stopped at midnight in reference to her album Midnights, which would go on to earn Swift her record-breaking fourth album of the year win later that evening.\n\nThough all involved have kept mum when it comes to confirming what that T stands for and the significance of Swift’s choice of red-on-red-on-red Sunday evening, there are some easy guesses to be had.\n\nIn her song “Guilty as Sin?” on her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, Swift sings, “what if he’s written ‘mine’ on my upper thigh, only in my mind”? Conversely, we wonder, what if Swift has found the most glam way to use that real estate to give Kelce a shoutout?\n\nWant even more Grammys 2025? Revisit every single red carpet look and all the night’s winners, and see who made Vanity Fair’s best-dressed list.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Taylor Swift Had ‘No Creative Involvement’ in Blake Lively’s ‘It Ends With Us’ Amid Lawsuit: Sources (Exclusive)\nBy Miranda Siwak \nFebruary 6, 2025\n\nDespite Taylor Swift’s name being mentioned in Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni’s ongoing legal saga, multiple sources tell Us Weekly that the pop star was not involved in the production of It Ends With Us.\n\n“Taylor has always been Blake’s friend, but Taylor doesn’t have any involvement in the case. She wasn’t part of the movie,” the source says. “Taylor was not a producer on the film and had no creative involvement.”\n\nSwift, 35, and Lively, 37, have been friends since 2015. Lively even asked (and was granted) permission to use Swift’s “My Tears Ricochet” in the It Ends With Us trailer. Baldoni’s legal team, meanwhile, has claimed that Swift could be deposed during the forthcoming trial.\n\n“While she and Blake are friends, this case is now a legal matter for the courts to resolve,” the insider adds. “Dragging Taylor into it is unnecessary and misrepresents what really happened.”\n\nBlake and Taylor s Friendship Hasn t Been Affected by Justin Baldoni Legal Drama\nRelated: Where Blake Lively and Taylor Swift Stand Amid Justin Baldoni Lawsuit\nA second source further points out to Us that Swift was “on tour” while the 2024 movie was being made. (Swift headlined her Eras Tour across multiple continents between March 2023 and December 2024.)\n\n“Taylor never even saw the film or a single scene from it until the movie was in theaters,” the second insider notes. “She is not relevant to the case.”\n\nTaylor Swift Had No Creative Involvement in Blake Lively s It Ends With Us Amid Lawsuit Sources\nJose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images\nLively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, 41, in December 2024, accusing her It Ends With Us costar and director of sexual harassment and fostering a hostile work environment. The actress, who was an executive producer on the film adaptation, also claimed that Baldoni tried to launch a campaign to destroy her reputation.\n\nJustin Baldoni s Lawyer Addresses Possibility of Deposing Taylor Swift in Blake Lively Lawsuit 922\nRelated: Justin Baldoni's Lawyer Addresses Possibility of Deposing Taylor Swift\nBaldoni vehemently and repeatedly denied the accusations, filing two lawsuits of his own last month. He first filed a $250 million defamation suit against The New York Times for publishing Lively’s accusations, later filing a separate case against Lively, her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and publicist Leslie Sloane for an additional $400 million. He claimed that Lively was “determined to make Baldoni the real-life villain in her story” to mask her alleged “tone-deaf” promotion of the film.\n\nBoth The Times and Lively denied the allegations before the two actors’ attorneys met for the first hearing earlier this month. While a trial date has been set for March 9, 2026, a judge ruled that it could be moved up if complaints continue to be “litigated in the press.”\n\n“We are pleased with the result of today’s hearing and eager to move forward immediately with discovery in this case,” Lively’s team told Us in a statement. “The Court granted our request that all attorneys in the matter actually follow the rule of law and not make any statements that could prejudice a jury. This case deals with serious allegations of sexual harassment and retaliation. We will hold the defendants accountable, and we are confident that once all the evidence is submitted in this matter, Ms. Lively will prevail.”\n\nBaldoni’s attorneys, meanwhile, told Us, “Our clients are devastated and want to move the case along as quickly as possible. We just couldn’t be more pleased with how the case was handled today, how it was managed. We’re going to move as quickly as we possibly can and prove our innocence, in a world where sometimes people judge you before they give you a chance. And we’re going to change that.”",

We're told all Taylor said to Justin was how excited she was to see the movie because he was her friend's boss.\n\nOur source says Taylor believes Blake timed her meeting with Justin so Taylor would arrive before he left and is baffled by Blake later characterizing her as her \"dragon.\" The source adds, \"It's weird to say that about a friend.\"\n\nAs Daily Mail reported, friends of Taylor's called the dragon remark, \"Uncool and unnecessary.\"\n\n[...] And there's more … the source says Taylor is also learning Blake has been inappropriately leveraging her name for a long time, like telling a young actress that Taylor \"cast her,\" which simply did not happen.\n\n[...] This is a huge falling out ... Taylor is godmother to one of Blake and Ryan's kids.\n\nBut, one source close to Blake has a different take, telling TMZ ... Blake believes the relationship is \"not strained\" with the two still talking regularly.\n\nAnother source close to the situation says Taylor was pissed about the extent to which she was involved, and specifically she was angry about the \"dragons\" remark … but Blake has since apologized, they had a good cry and hugged it out.",

The 35-year-old pop star is said to be releasing new songs based on her relationships, mainly with her partner Travis Kelce and friend Blake Lively.\n\nA source at AEG told Express.co.uk: “Taylor is in the development stages of her new album which will be released at the end of the year. She wrote songs backstage on her last tour and bosses at AEG have been told to prepare themselves for another tour in 2026.\"\n\nThey added: \"People who have heard some of the ideas say it’s inspired by a lot of what she’s been through including her relationship with Travis and changes in her friendships, specifically Blake Lively.\"\n\nThe exciting news comes as Taylor faced a tough time at the Super Bowl LIX earlier this month. She had made an appearance at the sporting event to support her Kansas City Chiefs star boyfriend Travis.\n\nIn a crowd made up of a majority of Philadelphia Eagles fans, Taylor found herself being viciously attacked by spectators when the camera flicked to her, sitting in her VIP area with Ice Spice and Este Haim.

Seeing the look on her face got to him. He always protects her and it broke his heart.\n\n\"He was already having a tough night and the fact that the stadium was predominantly Eagles fans didn't help.

      "Transcript/Content": "Exclusive: Taylor Swift and Tyler Hilton in 'Teardrops On My Guitar' music video\nTyler Hilton Is Down To Remake The “Teardrops” Video For Debut (TV)\n“Debut was my album. I loved it so much.”\n\nby Hannah Kerns\nMarch 27, 2025\n\nTyler Hilton might be best known for playing Chris Keller on One Tree Hill from 2004 to 2012, but longtime Swifties recognize him from another project. In 2007, Hilton took on the role of Drew in Taylor Swift’s “Teardrops on My Guitar” music video. Looking back, Hilton says he had “so much fun” working with Swift — and he’d be down to remake the music video when she re-releases her debut album.\n\nIn the song, Swift has an unrequited crush on Drew, who is “the reason for the teardrops on [her] guitar.” The music video features several scenes of Swift and Hilton at a high school — which makes sense, considering Swift was first introduced to Hilton’s work when she watched him on One Tree Hill, a high school drama. “I think she was a fan of the early seasons,” he says. “We connected because I heard her first single, ‘Tim McGraw,’ and I mentioned her in an interview. I said something like, ‘There’s this new girl out named Taylor Swift, and I think she’s really good.’”\n\nAfter Swift saw Hilton’s interview, her manager invited him to one of her concerts. “They told me, ‘She’s going to be covering your version of “Missing You” from One Tree Hill. Do you want to get up and sing with her?’” Hilton says. “I agreed, and when I was on stage with her, she asked me to be in the video. She said something like, ‘I thought if I asked you on stage, you couldn’t say no.’ She was bold.”\n\nAt the time, Swift was 17, and Hilton was 23. “We became such good friends after that. It felt like this little sister, older brother vibe. Her family was so sweet, too,” he says. “I was so taken with her. I thought she was great.”\n\nWhen he moved to Nashville years later, Hilton even lived on the Swift family’s houseboat. “Her bedroom had unicorns and princesses in it. She played me songs out of her diary,” he says. “None of that is an act — she really embraces who she is. It’s not always cool. It oftentimes exposes her to being made fun of because she can be a bit of a dork, but she leans into it. I love that about her.”\n\nThe two reconnected in 2018 when Hilton went to the Reputation Stadium Tour. “Her family was like, ‘Tyler, look at her. Isn’t she doing such a good job?’ They still act like they’re watching her at a talent show, and they’re filming her with their phones,” he says. “It’s like nobody has told them that she’s the biggest music star ever.”\n\nEven now, Hilton still has a soft spot for Swift’s first record. “Debut was my album. I loved it so much, so I think Taylor’s Version will be great,” he says. “And maybe we’ll remake the old ‘Teardrops’ video for old time’s sake.”",

News that he and Taylor Swift almost collaborated on a song, but he “couldn’t catch a vibe.”\n\nBy Bentley Maddox Mar 28, 2025 11:01 PM\n\nLil Nas X almost took a getaway car to the studio with Taylor Swift.\n\nThe “Old Town Road” rapper revealed that he and the “Lavender Haze” singer nearly collaborated on a song, but the track never got out of the woods.\n\n“We were working on something,” Lil Nas exclusively told E! News’ Francesca Amiker at the GLAAD Media Awards in Los Angeles March 27. “She offered to let me try a verse on something, but I couldn’t catch a vibe for it, so it didn’t happen.”\n\nAnd though the “Call Me By Your Name” singer (real name Montero Lamar Hill) didn’t “even want to talk about” the missed opportunity, he was able to shake it off and praise Taylor.\n\n“I’m proud of my girl,” he continued in the interview, airing on E! News March 31. “I love the album. She’s been doing her thing. She’s at the very tippety top. I’m thankful that she even considered me.” \n\nOf the potential to work together someday, he added, “When it happens… Global. World. Tay-tay and Nassy.”\n\nWhile Lil Nas hasn’t been featured on a Taylor track just yet, that’s not the only end game he has in mind. In fact, he would love to collab with 2025 Grammy winner Doechii.\n\n“My girl’s been doing her thing,” the 25-year-old said. “We’ve been about to get into the studio for like a year but we’ve never got to it. I just want to get out there.”\n\nBut as Lil Nas X is set to release his second album Dreamboy this summer, he’s not necessarily focused on collaborating with other artists.\n\n“I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of in my own zone right now just focused on me,” he explained with the caveat, “I’m super open to working with all the girls that I love, everybody that’s doing their thing right now. \n\nAnd when it comes to the vibes of Lil Nas X’s upcoming album? He simply doesn’t want to cause any drama.\n\n“This new music era is really gonna be carefree,” he shared. “It’s gonna be fun. I’ve always been the girl to rile everybody up. I don’t want to do that this time. I want to have fun.”\n\nFor more from Lil Nas X, tune into E! News March 31 at 11 p.m. Until then, keep reading to see more stars who showed up and showed out at the 2025 GLAAD Media Awards.",

They are hanging out with friends, too. It's a special time for them.\"\n\nThe insider says that Swift, 35, and Kelce, 35, are \"very serious and in sync,\" adding: \"They value the same things. Right now, the focus is very much on private time out of the spotlight.\"\n\nEveryone dressed up as their favorite era, wore friendship bracelets and Swift was given the \"22\" hat by Kelce as well.\n\nMeanwhile, Kelce wrapped up his 12th season with the Chiefs in February after the team lost the Super Bowl to the Philadelphia Eagles with Swift in attendance. In late February, Kelce confirmed that he wouldn't be retiring and returning to the Chiefs in the fall after weeks of speculation.\n\nKelce and Swift have been very supportive of each other since taking their romance public. Kelce has attended several Eras Tour concerts throughout its run, while Swift went to many Chiefs games during the regular season, the playoffs and even the Super Bowl.\n\nThe couple was most recently spotted out and about in March. Kelce and Swift were in Park City, Utah early March, per a video published by Deuxmoi. The couple also stepped out for dinner in New York City on March 14.\n\nThey also vacationed in Montana after the NFL season ended.",

The latest development in Lively v. Wayfarer Studios et al. is the reported possibility that Swift could be among those served with subpoenas. \n\n\"Blake knew she and Taylor would come back from this at some point and that their friendship wasn’t done for good,” the insider says of the legal difficulties. \n\n“Taylor was really hurt by this situation, so she’s relieved they were able to recover from this and put it all behind them because it wasn’t something she took lightly,” they add.\n\nSwift, whose song \"my tears ricochet\" was used in It Ends With Us and its trailer, has yet to publicly comment on Lively and Baldoni’s legal back and forth.\n\nThe Gossip Girl alum first sued her director-costar in December, accusing him of sexual harassment, “disturbing\" and “unprofessional” behavior on set and a retaliatory smear campaign. Baldoni has denied the allegations and, in January, filed a countersuit for defamation and extortion against Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds and their publicity team. \n\nAmong Baldoni’s claims are that Swift and Reynolds, 48, pressured him into accepting one of Lively's rewrites for screenwriter Christy Hall's adaptation of Colleen Hoover's hit novel. In the complaint, the Jane the Virgin alum described an alleged meeting at Lively and Reynolds’ penthouse where Swift “began praising Lively’s script. Baldoni understood the subtext: he needed to comply with Lively’s direction.”\n\nn an alleged text exchange following that interaction, Baldoni told Lively that her script changes were \"so much more fun and interesting\" and that he \"would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor,\" adding a playful emoji. She allegedly responded by comparing herself to Khaleesi from Game of Thrones, calling her husband and Swift her \"dragons” and later her \"Dance Moms level stage moms.\"\n\nSwift is both a longtime friend of Lively and Reynolds and godmother to the couple's four children: James, 10, Inez, 8, Betty, 5, and Olin, 2. Along with Reynolds’ Deadpool & Wolverine costar Hugh Jackman, the friends have been spotted together on numerous occasions, including at NFL games in support of Swift's boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nThe trial for Lively v. Wayfarer Studios et al., which will cover both lawsuits, is scheduled for March 2026.",

      "Transcript/Content": "Why Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce's 'Rare' Summer Downtime Has 'Been a Turning Point' in Their Relationship (Exclusive Source)\nThe Grammy winner and the Super Bowl champion have embraced a quieter pace since they started dating in the summer of 2023\n\nBy Sarah Jones  Published on July 1, 2025 05:25PM EDT\n\nTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce have been enjoying some \"rare\" downtime which has allowed their \"bond to deepen\"\nThis summer has been a \"turning point\" for the couple, who began dating in 2023\nAfter a whirlwind year filled with busy work schedules, Taylor and Travis have embraced a quieter pace\nAfter a whirlwind year filled with record-breaking concerts, Super Bowl games and global headlines, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are finally slowing down — and it’s been transformative for their relationship.\n\n\"It’s been a turning point for their relationship in a lot of ways,\" a source tells PEOPLE exclusively. \"They’re incredibly happy and in sync. There’s a calmness and ease to their relationship right now that’s been really grounding for Taylor and Travis.\"\n\nThe Grammy winner concluded her Eras Tour in December 2024 and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end wrapped up his NFL season in February, when his team faced off in the Super Bowl against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nSince then the pair, both 35, have embraced a quieter pace and a source says they’ve made the most of it.\n\n\"Taylor and Travis are soaking up every minute of this slower season together,\" the source continues. \"They've been splitting their time between New York, Nashville, and a few quiet getaways, just enjoying each other’s company without all the usual chaos. This kind of downtime is rare for both of them, and it’s really allowed their bond to deepen.\"\n\nThe couple has been spotted in the West Village during their time in Manhattan, often opting for low key date nights and cozy dinners with friends. In Nashville, they’ve spent time with Swift’s family and inner circle, staying mostly out of the public eye. \n\nThe pause comes at a meaningful time for Swift personally, as well. Last month, she revealed she regained control of her masters — a move that’s been years in the making and is deeply emotional for the singer.\n\n\"Reclaiming her masters has been emotional and empowering,\" says the source. \"She’s proud, relieved, and finally feels like a chapter has closed in the best possible way.\"\n\nKelce, who’s flown across the globe to support Swift, has quietly backed her behind the scenes.\n\n\"Having Travis by her side for that milestone made it even more special,\" the source adds. \"He was honored to support her and he wouldn’t have wanted it any other way.\"\n\nNow, with the calm of summer settling in, it’s clear the couple is savoring this rare window of normalcy.\n\nAs PEOPLE previously reported earlier this month, for the first time since the pair started dating, the pop superstar is heading into an NFL season without the demands of a global tour.\n\n\"Taylor is really looking forward to the upcoming NFL season. Not just because she loves supporting Travis, but because for the first full season since they started dating, she’s not juggling a packed tour schedule,\" the source told PEOPLE at the time.\n\n\"This fall will be completely different,\" the insider said. \"It’s the first season where she’s not constantly flying back and forth or working around an entire touring calendar.\"\n\n\"The past two seasons were a whirlwind between performing across multiple countries, long flights, and trying to squeeze in alone time together wherever possible,\" the source said. \"It wasn’t easy but they made it work.\"",

      "content": "20 Years Ago, She Met a Budding Musician at the Beach. She'd End Up Becoming One of the Biggest Pop Stars in the World (Exclusive)\nHolly Armstrong, a fan of Taylor Swift for over 20 years, has met the star twice — once in 2003 and again in 2019\n\nBy Luke Chinman  Updated on August 1, 2025 11:06AM EDT\n\nAs Holly Armstrong recounts the experience of receiving a DM from Taylor Nation — pop superstar Taylor Swift’s official fan club — inviting her to a secret listening session ahead of the release of Swift’s seventh studio album Lover in 2019, she doesn’t hold back.\n\n“I lost my s---,” Armstrong, a 34-year-old Texan, tells PEOPLE.\n\nThe listening party, dubbed in the fandom “Secret Sessions,” was a “fever dream” and everything Armstrong could ask for: it was “cathartic” to be surrounded by so many other superfans, she says, who could scream and cry together as they listened to an album of brand new songs that would soon soundtrack their lives.\n\nBut the fan meet-and-greet with Swift that followed was something else entirely. For many Secret Sessions attendees, the chance to chat and snap a photo with the “Cruel Summer” singer is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity — but Armstrong had already met Swift over a decade prior.\n\nIn 2003, years before the iconic singer-songwriter would release an innumerable string of chart-topping hits or collect her 14 Grammy awards, Swift, then a young teenager with a guitar and a dream to make it big in country music, was performing a small acoustic set on the boardwalk in Point Pleasant, N.J. \n\nArmstrong, who was 12 at the time, was on vacation with her family and spotted the young musician.\n\n“There were probably 20, 30 people at most, just gathered around,” she remembers. “It wasn’t a moment I thought would be as important as it has become.”\n\nAfter Swift finished her set, she handed out demo CDs to audience members — and when Armstrong went up to meet her, Swift asked if she wanted her to sign it. “We very briefly talked about whatever 13-year-old girls talk about,” says Armstrong. “I was just over the moon.”\n\nThough the CD only had two of Swift’s songs — demos of unreleased tracks “Lucky You” and “Smoky Black Nights” — when Armstrong returned home to Texas, the tunes played in her Walkman on repeat.\n\n“A few months after I got home from the beach, I went through something no kid should ever really have to go through,” she says of a life-altering event from her childhood. “And in that trauma, in that fear, in that feeling of not feeling safe, I latched onto the closest thing that I could — and that was Taylor’s music.”\n\nFor several years, Armstrong’s love of Swift's music was entirely personal. But slowly, as Swift put out her debut album in 2006 and released her first chart-topping record in 2008, the “gem that I had kept to myself for so long,” says Armstrong, became one of the most famous singers on the planet.\n\nAs Swift's popularity grew, so did her community of fans, who flocked to social media platforms like MySpace, Tumblr, Twitter and Instagram to discuss the pop sensation, debate their favorite songs and theorize about her future releases. But even as one of her earliest supporters, Armstrong says, she stayed quiet in the fandom about her experience of meeting Swift back in 2003 — wanting to protect the memory that had become so sacred for her.\n\n“The only social media I really did was Instagram, and I maybe had 100 followers — just family and friends,” says Armstrong. Though she would post her 2003 photo with Swift on the anniversary of the New Jersey concert every year, she never intended for it to reach the wider Swiftie community.\n\nBut the day Swift released “ME!” — the lead single from Lover — in 2019, Armstrong obsessed over Easter eggs in the music video, pulling out all of her Swift memorabilia from over the years and laying it out on her bed alongside the signed demo CD. She recorded a video of the moment, uploaded it to her personal Instagram account, and the post took off.\n\n“I don’t know what I did, I don’t know what hashtag I used, but it got swept up in the Swiftie community,” recalls Armstrong. “I was so flattered.”\n\nAnd when more fans discovered the 2003 photo of Armstrong with Swift, her account received even more attention and “an outpouring of kindness unlike anything I’d ever imagined,” she says.\n\nAs she became more enmeshed in the fandom over the next few months, she discovered how the community acted as a “lifeline for so many people, myself included,” Armstrong tells PEOPLE. \n\nFor instance, when fans who are struggling to pay their bills try to sell their merch to make some extra cash, rather than buying the merch, fans will donate a few dollars to help out so that Swifties in need don't have to part with their prized possessions. And when Armstrong candidly opened up about a traumatic moment from her childhood on social media, she was overwhelmed by the response.\n\n“The way people responded to that — I have no words,” she says.\n\nArmstrong even credits the fan community for uplifting her story across social media in 2019, so much so that it caught the attention of Swift herself, who invited Armstrong to a Secret Sessions in August before Lover dropped.\n\nWhen she finally reunited with her idol after 16 years, they had a lot to chat about — Swift even remembered performing on the New Jersey boardwalk, says Armstrong.\n\n“And to top it all off, she thanked me,” Armstrong adds. “It was the most validating thing I’ve ever heard, and I didn’t know I needed to hear it.”\n\nWhen Armstrong returned home from the listening party, no longer sworn to secrecy and able to share her experience on her social media platforms, fans similarly showed up, sending her dozens of messages, excited that she finally got the chance to reunite with Swift.\n\nAnd Swifties have continued to support Armstrong over the past few years.\n\nDuring the pandemic, a bout of extreme burnout from her corporate job sent her into a deep depression and prompted her to need six months of leave. With her time off, she discovered a love of crafting — painting, designing jewelry and making candles — and eventually decided it was time for a career shakeup. \n\nArmstrong left her job and started working on Starlight & Sage Co., an online shop where she sells hand-crafted goodies loosely inspired by some of her favorite lyrics and themes from Swift’s music, which officially launched on July 23. She says she's been amazed by the level of interest from fellow Swifties across social media.\n\nOn the first day of operations, she received 22 orders — even though she says she “genuinely did not expect any.”\n\n“It’s been the most fun I’ve ever had,” says Armstrong of the new business. “Swifties show up.”",

      "content": "[Taylor Swift Updatess] She [Taylor] was kind enough to let me stay at her house. My mom lives in Topanga Canyon. So, my mom, I said, you know, \"it's a dangerous place to be. Come.\" And my mom  has a pet snake, and so she has her evacuation stuff. She came over with the snake, and we ended up having to stay there for about 2 weeks. And Taylor has this very beautiful house, you know, it's from the 30s. A beautiful house, something you wanna preserve and take care of. And so me and my mom are living in this house together and it was the last day, I was gonna leave. My mom was actually gonna stay longer, I had to leave for work. I was packing my things and I was saying to my mom, 'I really wanna be a good houseguest, I like to leave places better than I found them. I don't want her to even know we were here.' And so, I was kinda going around and cleaning up, and I'm downstairs, and she's upstairs, and my phone rings. And it's my mom. I answer the phone and she goes 'Hi!' and I'm like, 'your voice is super high' and she's like 'I'm in a little bit of a pickle, can you come upstairs?' so I go upstairs and the bathroom door is closed. I open the bathroom door and she's crouched in the corner, in this weird way, and I'm like 'what's going on dude?' and she's like 'so, I was washing my face and I had Orpheus [snake's name] and I just put her down for a second, closed the door, and she found this little hole in the corner.' So there was a little hole, that you wouldnt even notice was there, that was in the corner of the bathroom. The hole is next to a banquette that is build into the wall, it has 2 drawers in the bottom [...] so I don't know what to do, I start to panic. I call my assistant Caroline, she comes upstairs, she doesn't know how to help in this situation. So, the house manager was there, he comes up. We're like 'so the snake- there's a snake by the way' and he gets a crowbar and he starts to tear apart this banquette. We're ripping up the tile, we're scratching the walls, me and my mom are both holding the snake. And there was this moment where I was like 'either we destroy her bathroom, or I have to tell her that there's a snake somewhere in her house.' So, we destroyed the bathroom, and I said to her house manager 'Obviously, I'm gonna pay for everything to be fixed. Please just don't say anything to Taylor until it's fixed.' And I remember calling her saying 'Hey!' also in a very high voice, 'Hey! I just wanted to talk to you about something' and she was like 'is it the fact that you almost lost a snake in my house and destroyed my bathroom?'\" ",

I think she was getting maybe a little antsy, but he was going to put her off till this week, to, you know, make some grand thing, to make it a big special event. And I told him repeatedly, you know, you could do it on the side of the road, do it any place that makes it a special event ... when you get down on one knee and ask her to marry you.\"\n\n\nEd said Swift's father, Scott Swift, was telling Travis the same thing.\n\nWhen the special day arrived, Travis popped the question at a garden at his home in Lee's Summit, Missouri.\n\n\"He got her out there, they were about to go out to dinner, and he said, 'let's go out and have a glass of wine,' ... they got out there, and that's when he asked her, and it was beautiful,\" Ed Kelce said. \"They started FaceTiming me and their mother and her folks to make sure everybody knew. So, to see them together is great.\"\n\nHe said he was at a Philadelphia Eagles practice when he got the call that the two were engaged.\n\n\n\"I was at ... an Eagles practice, a public practice that they had a lot of people that, well, the Eagles had 60,000 people at a public practice two weeks ago on a Sunday night,\" Ed Kelce said. \"So at that practice ... I got a FaceTime call from them, and as soon as I saw the FaceTime, I saw it was Travis, and then I saw Taylor there with him, I knew what they were going to say, and they, you know, let us know.\"\n\nEd said he knew about Travis's plan to propose months in advance; he even expected him to pop the question during last year's NFL season.\n\nHe said he has not seen his son happier than he is with Swift.\n\n\"We actually went to a thing in KC Sunday night, which was an ESPN airing of 'The Kingdom' and went to that, and his mother and I went with him back to his house for dinner, where Taylor made dinner, and we had a wonderful dinner with them outside on the patio and to just watch the two of them, just crazy about each other. It's truly kinda neat,\" Ed Kelce said.\n\nWhile the engagement is still new, and no wedding planning has occurred quite yet, Ed said he is as prepared as he can be for the wedding bells.\n\n\"They're just two young people very much in love, cast in a spotlight that they really haven't sought but kind of followed with their success in their respective fields,\" Ed Kelce said.",
